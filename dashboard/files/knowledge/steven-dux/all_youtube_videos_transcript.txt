all right so the first trade I made was
through djt first trade was made here I
spotted the consolidation in the 54 I
believe traded about 130 million shares
and uh followed with a big gap down so
on my average is around 50 when the all
the way back to I believe was 40 and
once they bounced back it didn't really
capture here and of course I should have
shorted it goinging to the second red
day and wasn't be able to catch the
massive downturn here and going into the
election light G all the way to 54 I
woke up around 1:00 a.m. so short it
into the top around 50 and uh cover into
the 42s and waited for a bounce then
sizing into the $45 area after market
open it panicked all the way to 37 so
that is pretty much all my uh entry and
exit I did uh size in again going to the
close of course he gap down went all the
way to 26

what's up guys live in Dexter today
we're gonna talk about a bunch of plays
this week personally for myself I made
her around 120 UK and I wish you guys to
prove before that let me give you guys
some tips how to really treat the
stickers when there's too many players
which wants you to pick as a priority
and all that so see ya and viel is the
major play for me this week and followed
by MDG s co TX vor X and O ASM so let's
start the least important of OAS M and
when the market cap was this big was
anywhere around over a 100 million
parabolic over 70% is likely to fail
almost all the time because as I said in
a previously it's also including the
trading technique if you all start to go
over a 100 percent intraday it's based
on a market cap let's say a 30 million
Marie kappa needs another 30 million
money to inject into the stop to be able
to make the stock respect over 100
percent but if it's a lower flow let's
say I Vista Tim market cap I only need
10 million to pour into the cap to make
it spike 1% so the bigger the cap the
more difficult for the stock to spike as
percentages let's say for apples and
nambas on those are billions trillions
market cap for that despite 100 percent
you need to say mana money but there's
not much money going back and forth on
that one day so that's the difference
between the small cap in a larger cap
and if the market cap is anywhere around
100 percent more in spike over 70
percent it's likely to fail but if you
don't have really resistance to risking
to so we had to be really really careful
I did mentioned in my chat and I said
2.6 would be a decent area to show them
to you but you do really bounce that
much and they didn't really form a
conception area and it's also a clean
chart since it started at 20 started
2018 so for the past year there's no
resistance at all and it's all based on
percentages and reading candlesticks
just remember if the market cap is over
100 million it's really difficult for a
start you do
morning spike intense the whole doubling
spike for a long period of time you were
likely to fell within very short amount
time like one now or 30 minutes let's go
over V lrx this ticker did a reverse
split a month ago if you take a look at
intraday charts you see this afternoon
gap and you see this huge morning spike
as well when you see a stock lose this
majority of the morning spike or a
pretty mark again
and before you even mark it open the
stock is unlikely to do a push but
before that that doesn't really mean you
wanna chase any weakness and surely into
it
it's you need to wait until the stock
trade solemn on a volume that's the
number one because when the stock is
dropping you will start to securities
when starts dropping people don't like
you to buy anymore because they see the
drop and there is a war what happens it
drops more so they're kind of fear of
buying into the stock tickers and
especially for those type of stocks they
don't really have that much volatility
because there's not much volume in there
so always make sure pay attention to the
volume first the ball needs to fit the
specific requirements intraday long
minimum is around four million so make
sure it needs to fit that criteria first
then pick the correct candle and you
were never gonna sure into like a
morning's back into pre market
resistance before all that volume is the
most important thing you need to find
the recruit ease and you want to make
sure the stock is not dead because you
don't want to be stuck in there then if
you want to cover you are getting
squeezed because there's such a thing
asked and your shares can affect the
stocks so now this also talked about say
odx the reason I don't really like stock
spiking from like a couple sent to to
daughter the volatility is good there's
tons of arm training especially I think
I'll say the extra about I think around
ten six meaning the pre market that's
concert to be super crowded so when I'm
looking at the stickers and if the stock
is consolidating are around like a 1.6
1.3 range those are really close to $1
because stocks like to hold that area to
meet there
NASDAQ requirements so they will hire a
bunch of merrymakers and to manipulate
start over 1 I think we saw one of
examples mvy is one of the very good
examples that stocks tends to hold one
daughter and squeeze all the way to 3
and inspector thousands of percent
that's why I don't really rush into
shorting - especially these type of
stocks you see our landing under or
consolidating under around 1.6 or 1.5
don't try to rush into the shore just be
patient because sometimes I just rather
to skip the step of trades low price
stocks
first you gotta pay more money to borrow
shares second cup add more shares to
meet your certain criteria let's say I
want to put $30,000 into this trade over
$10,000 into this trade if it's the
stock is around $3 and I need to buy
10,000 shares or 30,000 investment then
if the stock is only one daughter Nana
got 30,000 shares then I'm going to sell
those 30,000 Jews by the end of the day
as at a trading execution so you gotta
pay 60,000 shares worth of money and
that is too much and it's not really
good compared to the gains so I will
suggest avoid something around anywhere
under 1.5 1.6 all right he needs to be
above 2 for me to get comfortable but
that is my personal opinion I think
micro cap stocks has a great potential
not a people tends to buy or Shore into
pennies to send antonsen I don't know
how to do it but personally I like to
trade starts above 2 MD GS
this is also one of the stocks that
spiked and just dumped straight out
today if those type of stocks are in
your scanner when the market opens first
volume second the stock is unlikely to
spike because if it tends to do is over
50% in pre market stock is unlikely to
spike that's one of the statistics have
been tracking for a long time and also
into the balance in exactly to fail but
look at the volume on the needs when the
stock is dropping the pre market and
it's not attracting out tons of volume
we can compare and to
sell at 600 K for any K and above my new
km vgs for 40k ad k 160 cares the
highest and those type of tickers we
cannot really sure into barns to saying
and if you're going into like a
relatively size you're going to affect
the market and you know life is going to
squeeze yourself so you don't want to do
that and you're also chasing two
weaknesses once you see the stocks
volume is number one priority second
look at the chart either I want to
choose the balance to show it into
either one and choose the pre-market
resistance showing you I will prefer
them premature resistance is around 4.45
but most of the times are not going to
get there so it depends on how you
really manage your risk
that's Matassa MDG s so now the two most
important things are vis a and C and C I
was a super low from micro cab and I
think I tempted assuring here covered us
I think around 400 bucks and I didn't
get really a chance to show it into it
because the stock is just straight
grinding up and super parabolic there's
not really consolidating resistance and
if you look at the downtrend the HR or
pre marketers or consolidation
resistance around 6 but if you're
shorting to that there's not actual
volumes traded in Jaffna or pre market
I'm not the tempted esure interact 5.6
but the stock is already down 30% 40%
it's not going to drop more so I avoid
it and into this day pounds and a lot of
people shorting the charm Congrats
and when the stock is doing SSR just
remember if the stock doesn't really
have a consolidation area be really
really careful if the stocks on SSR and
squeezing shares always wait for the
consolidation will always wait for crack
major cracking and shorting to advance
much much safer
don't be somebody stupid and sure in
Toorak 5.5 and also I'm going to be
shorting 5.5 in my room but there's not
really heavy resistance in there so when
you wanna sell in make sure it's a seem
small next song wait for a crack much
safer better odds if you sure the
five-on-five congrats you made this
money but in a round turn round you will
tend to lose money now be iso is the
major player that I did alive
webinar the stock was consolidating the
seventh one socratis $7 area I showed it
intercept six point two added when the
fire crackdown and I hope they're two
minute before it closed maybe around
eighty thousand dollars then the stock
they're offering the next day and drop
all the way to where it begins when I
took the chart I think another state was
down 50% I already went got all over it
because if it held overnight can make
extra forty thousand but you never know
I rather took my profits and then paying
time seven borrow fees verse L was one
of the very good example of with
conservation cracking down if the stock
is treating so much volume and on the
same level again and again again think
about it the low flow is supply and
demand and the lower is supply the
higher the demand the price will go up
I think about in a reverse way so if you
think if the stock trading so much fun
there's definitely demand and there's
also the amount on supplier why the
price is not going up it's consolidate
the same place for all for almost four
hours so if there is so much demand and
the the stock is not really pushing up
it means there's something going on and
once the stock cracks all this
consolidation area becomes resistance so
once they cracked
that's why shorted I think he lost about
50% of its gain your instant and I just
figured it more by the close so that
just little pattern it's not really a
gap up short it's not really first ready
sure this is like an intraday crack it
happens not many times per year but
happens about five to ten times per year
next time I'll just tell myself to how
little bit more and when I look at this
overall charts most of the role flow
when it drops or lose during major
momentum they drop about 75% of its own
gain which is right around here and I
did not see the offering coming so
that's why I missed the profits but I'm
pretty confident with my trade I think I
did a decent job so here's the
trailermate on via SL made around
$80,000 average around the five
point eight and covered in 4.4.2 which
is on the charts I think by the end of
the day dumped it all the way to 4.12 I
cover around 4.2 which is a decent mom
and my initial size of 6.2 so which is
around here have the major momentum and
I had a twin of five cracked then I did
a small size of women five cracked have
a total average five point eighty which
is starting from here and covered by the
day so that's a night raid on V ISL
hopefully you guys enjoyed the recap and
we have a conference coming up you just
want to see me live trade and it's all

hello guys Ste luxer welcome to this
video I know I haven't done a video for
a long time but starting from this week
I'll be doing about two videos a week so
hopefully you can catch up to all the
monthly recap throughout this year for
this video I'm going to talk about this
month specifically not much going on but
there's about four to five opportunities
that you can trade with go through all
the trades this month before I start
this video make sure to click the like
button and subscribe let's get into it
okay so the for the very first ticker of
the month is Ln the initial market cap
for this one is roughly a little bit
under 1 billion so what we have as a
sample to calculate as a dollar block
for this month or for this year is gme
and MC I don't think there's any other
tickers that traded more volume compared
to Ln and also uh with similar market
cap so for this one uh it did a massive
consolidations in August 8th so the
total dollar was traded is roughly
around 1.7 billion and we had a big red
day on the following day so let's go to
August 7th yeah had a massive
consolidations in the 6.7 is traded
about 250 million volume I trade about
260 million volume time 6.5 that's
around 1.7 to calculate the pre-market
it traded about I think around 16
million shares or 20 million shares in
the pre market so the volume is not
likely to exceed the previous day volume
that's why I had a mass as a red day the
only reason I didn't go really
aggressive on into this is there is only
two day round so one from 2 to8 and
typically we want multi Dev oners to
around 3 days in a row and for more
consolidations before the momentum tends
to shift so going specifically on Ln I
should have gone aggressive on Ln
powering to size and writing the reward
all the way back to the 5ish so missed
about 20% 30% there yeah that's my
overall thoughts for real men not a
perfectly ideal chart and the other
trade that I made was GDC so this one
had a 3D run the only thing that I don't
really like is it had a massive pullback
in the premarket including aftermarket
open on the second greenness then you
tested the premarket High it actually
Consolidated and held it skin through
end of the day whenever you want to use
the pre-market pullback and risking the
pre-market High first of all the
pre-market needs to trade solid money
shares which he did the test into the
pre-market resistance was solid as well
he had the pull back as soon as it tends
to recover uh you will have to exit it's
not really wise to hold overnight can
see you went all the way to 12 going to
the next day had about 50% pullback
which is not really predictable had a
bounce from the 6ish area so the overall
volume it's not that great 25 minute
shares traded throughout the day so I
will say maybe 50 shares Shor into the
consolidations but that is also not very
ideal as well so GDC seems very
manipulated doesn't look like a natural
developed chart typically when you see
there's not sufficient volume high flow
tickers tends to slow grind a lot so
that's for GDC there is another ticker
ffi we did a reverse split and tend to
run again it FedEd too much on the
second Green Day so that's why I had the
bounce after first red day so there one
thing that you have to pay attention to
is whenever you are shorting or using a
first red day pattern if the first red
day drops too much let say exceeding 50%
of the total round range then going into
the following day you will have to be a
little bit careful I see a lot of people
getting squeezed in going to this day
you can see after about 11:30 went all
the way back to 8 which didn't trade
that much volume and going to the next
day it bounced then it slowly faded so
should I build a swing positions into
this but the volume is really low
trading only 3 to four mini shares a day
so you could get easily squeeze up to 8
n 10ish that's why I didn't build a
swing position into this not very ideal
another one is
nrn this is not a healthc care stock it
looked like it's Health Care staff but
it's a consumer discretionary so
basically I said to myself that I don't
trade botch but this one was not a botch
it's actually a regular Gap up short so
had a 3 minute float 20% pushing
percentage this is just a regular Gap up
short didn't fade 75% from the top only
faded 50% since it's IPO so that's a
pretty standard pattern to trade so
those are the four takers that I traded
through this month billion dollar rocket
cap I seem like the dollar block is
around 1.72 billion I still need more
samples to test it out going to multi
rers on GDC seems very manipulated not a
natural developed chart if it's a
natural developed chart you should lost
this moment on this day on August 22nd
for FF dropped too much on the first red
day so it didn't give us much reward on
the second red day mrm is was a
healthcare but it's actually not a
healthare so those are the four tickers
through this month not very IDE deal but
small profits is okay to be made that
should be it for the recap for this
month all right guys thank you very much
for watching this video let me know if
you have any questions for this recap
and I will start going back doing the I
think I got to I think March so I'm
missing May April June and July so I
will start doing all the Recaps for the
past few months and do like total
conclusions for 6 months throughout this
year and uh definitely there is few
statistics and changes need to be made
but overall this month overall this year
the market has been been pretty good
summer usually to be tends to be slow we
have about 3 months of slow Seasons
until October so October November and
December will be the month that NES the
most play be patient and yeah that'll be
end of this video thank you very much
for watching I'll see you guys in the
next one

hello guys Tim Ducks here welcome to
this video So today we're going to take
a look at my profits throughout this
year and I haven't post any I would say
profits since beginning of this year
because I feel I was not very
disciplined so let's take a look at my
trade zero account statements from
January to August let's go over some of
the tickers giving I would say my
personal thoughts about the overall
Market this year some of the mistakes
that I personally made so hopefully you
can get some conclusions for you guys to
be able to avoid the mistakes that I
make so let's get into the video all
right let's take a look at uh the
overall this year you can see in 2023 uh
January it was 100 000 February was 40
000. I remember during February we do
not have that many plays but in general
we do have tons of play and that's
definitely profitable I think I did okay
on March and there's tons of play in May
which I missed tons of opportunities was
350 000 in March and they lost 164 000
in in April which that was top and mhgl
and I did not manage my risk very well
so that's a big mistake by me during May
I think I did okay then June or July
there there were times to play but I
also made several mistakes in July
there's not many plays but in June there
were a play and I made mistakes in
August I think I did okay let's take a
look at the symbols that I made money
and they lost money on so the first one
aurc BMR do you remember this one I do
believe it's a gap through resistance
pru I think was also on Capital
resistance VMware was a bouncer I think
no this one was a K-pop short sorry then
bzft this one I mismanaged I think I
showed it a day early this was a multi
Runners and I definitely screwed it up
and they didn't have confidence holding
throughout the entire day I think was on
the day they dropped this one I think
one from one to four on the day it
dropped he dropped after 2 30 so they
dropped really late I think I was
traveling in that two months so I and be
able to catch the the profits on that
one but if I had enough patience I think
I could definitely made this one much
better than losing almost 70 000 on that
one then those are small losses CV and a
I think this was a billion dollar cap so
I traded at the billion dollar account
which wasn't on my trade list because I
tend to avoid orbital caps so that one
was a dying mistake this one is
available the pcfd it's definitely
avoidable then six AI that was a ticker
I think I traded two times each time
last eight thousand so that's small
mistakes that's fine f r z a this was a
failed Capital resistance because the
resistance was canceled so I tried two
to three times the three times did not
work and the volume was overwhelming it
was breaking through the resistance
multiple times so as I see the volume is
overwhelming I should stay away from
this one 130k in terms of mistakes right
there did it not trade it very well gfai
this one was a multi-deer honor I think
it went to 20. not sure how I lost money
on this one I think I lost money on the
front side the main one on the downside
and we have other losses we have G and S
I do believe this is a biotech shouldn't
be trading biotechs that's another
bosses can be available gsit is 1.7 the
gap down and went to seven again dropped
around 330 ish the same shorter 2 early
I keep running into the stickers that
trades very crowded on intraday I should
just close my platform and walk away and
those are 200 mistakes that's fixable
then we have big loss on megl this one
I'll be honest also crowded traded on
the crowded days showed around 100 mini
shares besides doing while the stock was
crowded and it signs weaknesses so
that's a big mistake by me I was
thinking that MHO is the sympathy play
of top when tlb was spiking and Michio
wasn't moving so that means the chart
itself is very bearish because the main
play is coming out and simply play
should be going up but it's going
sideways and had a one hour or half an
hour delay so I piled in on the short
side and I can see common losses lost
150k on that one that was a giant
Mistakes by me then we had another one
which was OC which is the biggest loss I
have this year big skin was Emmy away it
was 200k this one I think it was on
parabolic keep adding it it was a
biotech you shouldn't be treating
biotechs also in btx also another
biotech IPO and you can see the next
biggest loss was pacw this one was a
banking stock I think billion dollar cap
also psqh I do believe this is a 500K
flow so now it's another one and spry I
think is also about tech
sfwl this one was over trading so three
conclusions throughout These Years first
of all do not trade crowd attackers
that's trading over 100 mini shares
throughout the day second do not trade
billion dollar cap that's not penny
stocks it's not micro caps those
stickers are really difficult to predict
third do not trade biotechs I could
avoid maybe 500 1000 in terms of
mistakes or maybe even 1 million so the
total profit I could make is throughout
this year and one side Matters by over
trading avoiding all the sectors that I
shouldn't be trading I could save one
million dollars in terms of mistakes the
only one that I I would say this one is
maybe okay to lose other than that
everything else it's a mistake that can
be fixable there are some tickers that
you know I lost 20K 10K there those are
not big of deal this is how I really
review my account statements I have
focused on the biggest losses so I can
improve it still making the same
mistakes hopefully I can improve
throughout the rest of the year and make
sure I can stay more consistent and
profitable let's see how I do for the
rest of four months alright guys that'll
be the entire review for the one million
dollar profit terms of trade zero
account statements hopefully you guys
learned something and those are my
mistakes uh willing to share them if you
have any questions please leave a
comment below and I will see you guys in
the next one

and going to the election light Gap all
the way to 54 on January 20th when Trump
gets into the White House I believe this
is going to Gap up again I will be able
to profit about 2.1 million throughout
this entire
month hello guys do sir welcome to this
video and today I'm going to go over
pretty much the entire November uh
trades and including the biggest profit
and the biggest mistake I was be able to
profit about 2.1 million throughout this
entire month mainly through djt and some
of the losses that shouldn't be taking
so going to give you some of my
conclusions of how to really trade into
this Market before I start this video
make sure to click the like button and
subscribe let's get into it all right so
the first trade that I made was through
djt first trade was made here I spotted
the consolidation in the 54 I believe
traded about 130 million shares and uh
followed with a big gap down so on my
average is around 50 let swing it all
the way back to uh believe was 40 and
once I bounced back it didn't really
capture here and of course I should have
shorted it going into the second red day
and wasn't be able to catch the massive
downturn here and going to the election
light G all the way to 54 I woke up
around 1:00 a.m. so short it into the
top around 50 and uh cover into the 42s
and wait for a bounce then sizing into
the $45 area after market open it
panicked all the way to 37 so that is
pretty much what my uh entry and exit I
did uh si in again going into the close
of course he gap down went all the way
to 26 so this is a Classico deer
shorting into Massive Resistance the
only thing is to how to really manage
your risk because whenever you're
shorting around 45 your risk is all the
way to 54s are risking almost 30% of
your entry so if you manage to captured
the again from 55 to 42 you can use that
as your leverage and increasing your
risk to be able to sh into the 45 then
cover into the 20 I believe like the
final cover was 28 I did not expecting
this one go all the way to 33 so L on
profits here but that's pretty much the
entire djt trade uh going forward I
believe on January 20th when Trump gets
into the White House I believe this is
going to Gap up again so that will place
a good bounce short into the 50
uh depends on where this going to end up
in the before January 20th so if it
hovers around 40 to 45 then I don't
think it's really good opportunity short
to a massive push but if it creates de
amount of range let's say consolidates
around 32 30ish I think it will be a
great opportunity if it spikes to 55
then from 55 fade all the way back to
maybe the high 30s so that's my overall
thoughts on djt interested in trading

simply click the link in the description
below to get started now let's dive back
into the content then there's another
ticker btct which I made a big mistake
on uh shorting into the premarket I
thought the previous day 20 million
shares traded into the consolidation was
sufficient enough to block the spike
from breaking the $12 area of course you
can see the ticker spend about 5 milon
shares breaking through the $12 area and
BTC is also related to bitcoin so one
lesson to be learned that do not short
into a ticker that related to1 to2
trillion market cap because it's pretty
much unpredictable going forward uh
let's say a tier is following closely to
a trillion dollar market cap then I
recommend it saying really small and you
can see this sticker reached it start
block when Consolidated around 20 but it
still didn't drop on the third day so it
dropped on the fourth day with really
light volume it still hovered around 18
for a very long time before uh it
dropped overall btct made a mistake over
here covered into I believe once it
broke 14 that's where I covered but that
is the biggest profit and the biggest
trades through November that should be
it all right guys that'll be the recap
for uh November trades overall in terms
of entry and exit and of course the
volume is definitely going up Res soon
so control your risk while amplifying
your size and yeah that'll be end of
this video thank you very much for
watching I will see you guys in the next

the ticker that I made uh 300K was djt
it had a resistance in the 38 so it
tested 32 33 is this is where I sized in
so let's go into the intraday level so
it break down in the afternoon and uh
had its gap down and showed really big
weaknesses in the premarket also after
the market open I shorted it in a 32 is
was doing pretty big size because I
think if there's a massive resistance in
the 37 and we're topping a 3 3 it's not
really worth it to re break 33 and go
test that 38 resistance again because
there's multiple resistance up the 40s
50s and 60s I piled pretty big size into
it 100K shares and once the breakdown
happened I was covering adding the
bounces at covering adding bounces

hello guys do next here uh I know I
haven't done a video for a long time but
uh I'll be back on track doing videos
every month so today I'm going going to
do a recap for the entire May and uh
here are the few trades that I made and
why I made those trades overall this
month has has been pretty good there's
only two losses I be able to spot uh the
right chance to trade and the only thing
that I didn't do well is the probably
the sizing how much I should be sizing
in in terms of how much vol been traded
throughout the day so before I start
this video make sure to click the like
button and subscribe uh let's get into
it so as you can see that uh for the
entire May uh the biggest skin was gme
ffi and uh AMC so I'm going to talk
about those three trades and of course B
and f as well so overall close to
700,000 in May let's get into all the
details for the trades and why I made
those trades let's start with May 14th
this is where I made the trade so we had
two day round of AMC this is the
sympathy play of gme because we have
those hype of gme after R Kitty posted
uh his positions on gme so that bring
the volume into MC as well overall
there's one thing that I didn't pay
attention to is the forward split on gme
the reason why I mention about forward
split is I'm not really sure that
forward split will cancel the resistance
I'm 100% sure that uh reverse split will
cancel the resistance typically when
reverse split happens it will completely
refresh the chart and all the resistance
will be cancelled then if the bound
comes in today then will be a fresh
chart there is no resistance or no
resistance to risk off and it will not
be a boun short that's where I see a lot
of people making mistakes that treating
a reverse split as a boun short then of
course if they short it they will get
squeezed and when I was seeing I was not
very sure that Forest spit will cancel
the resistance so I was waiting for the
chart show itself where the resistance
is and this is the chart that the forest
spit has already pressed in uh I do
remember back in the days that uh gme
resistance uh was at 400 300 to 400 and
after forward split the gme high spun
was at 120 so major resistance it landed
anywhere between 60 to 70 as you can see
here's a double top right here and the
for split do does not cancel the
resistance so you can see that on May
14th you H 70 instant crash all the way
down to 60 that's where I was confirmed
that the resistance is around 70 and
that's where I picked the AMC short
right about on the breakdown so the
average is around 950 I cover in the
five and 6ish for gme it had a crash uh
in the midday but I saw that there is a
bunch of support I formed the day before
so which is on May 13th so so there is a
massive consolidations before the
breakout around 30 so I knew that the
neutralized area will be stating around
30 as you can see that the chart fade
all the way back down to 36 and formed
the massive support that's where I
covered my positions around 30 I think
it was around 36 is I resorted it around
45 covering the pullback and I did not
touch it for the rest of the day because
I know that there's a massive support
about 30 but on MC there's no support
whatsoever it's a slow grind all the way
up to five then gapped up and all the
way to 10 so that was my two trades on
AMC and gme overall the size wasn't very
ideal I should have sized him much more
aggressively because of very sufficient
volume on both tickers and we had couple
spikes until gme did its U massive
offering up about in June 7th so if the
chart was affected by offering and it
was dropped by offering this is not a
natural developed chart and that's where
I did not size into the 48 because I
knew that there is a mass of support
around 30 to 40 and sizing up at 48
isn't a very good place to get enough
reward so that's why I just not for
forgot about it and did not trade it for
the rest of the day and based on those
two opportunities the only chance that I
see is shorting into the breakdown after
the resistance confirms and uh I don't
think I missed any other play but uh of
course other than that the size was a
problem and uh the rest of it is think I
did okay on those two TI tickers

click the link in the description below
to get started now let's dive back into
the content another one is B and S uh
this one I think I traded back in in May
so I had the first Green Day follow with
the second day I think I traded on a
second day this is a reverse split chart
I believe all the previous resistance do
not count it happened in May 1st had its
push there were no par resistance
because it did a reverse split going
into the second day which is on Monday
sizing around N9 into the push covering
into the six it was a small trade about
20K 20 to 30k shares overall the flow
was really small so I was being very
careful that'll be the entire trade for
the month of May and pretty much other
tickers are small gains and this is
where I want to say that you don't have
to trade that much to make a sufficient
enough gain throughout the month I think
if you can perfectly trade maybe three
to four trades I think that will be for
pretty much all your GS you can bring it
up up to seven figures even eight
figures by placing four to five trade
depending on your account size but
focusing on one strategy or two strategy
and track the frequency and trade it
anywhere between you know three to five
times a month I think that would be uh
very good much less stress watching it
and scaling it every single day that be
very efficient and that would consider
much a stressfree type of strategy
trading it throughout the year but
overall this year the volume is very
sufficient and the trades they come in
very often you can definitely see at
least five trade a month uh sometimes in
like February and June you will see
maybe 10 plus trades throughout the
month all right guys that'll be end of
this video thank you very much for
watching I'll see you guys in the next

hello guys duer welcome to this video So
today we're going to go over the entire
year of 2023 and how Market has actually
changed and what should we do in terms
of adjusting our strategies going into
2024 so this video will be a little bit
longer one compared to the others and uh
before I start this video make sure
click the like button and subscribe and
let's get into it all right so the first
one I want to cover is uh botex so we've
been experiencing a lot more biotechs
compared to technology stocks and let me
show you guys a very interesting
statistics so we have a bunch of tickers
that happened uh that's in the biotech
sectors as I talked about in the
previous couple videos biotex they do
not follow the average statistics that
we are being currently be tracking I
have built a sheet of pretty much all
the biotex included with the normal
players together and we will have uh
three roles which is if you trade
without the botex if you trade with the
botex and if you only trade botex Tex
and we will have pretty much end of the
summary of how it's going to perform
until end of the year and all those
entries and exits will be automatically
calculated by the average noral
statistics say uh 1 million to 3 million
float we're looking at 30% 20% pushing
percentages on Gap up short overextend
Gap Downs based on BT comparisons uh
first R Day based on dollar block and
every entry and exit it's based on the
normal statistics and we have have
generated sheets of how it's going to
perform throughout the entire year also
I have personally generated uh sheets in
the last couple years as well and I just
want to prove you guys that um trading
biotch they're not very profitable and
for all of beginners we are seeing
gappers even included bounce shorts they
don't actually work that well and uh
let's take a look if you're only trading
botex and there's wins and loses losses
through end of the year you will be in
the negatives and if you trade without
botex you you will be in the positive
trading with the biotex and the normal
play you will be down and you can see
the numbers is not drastically big
difference it's close to 700,000 and
800,000 but all the losses you are
taking in between can compound into much
bigger profits when you are trading low
more place so this is just based on the
fixed size you can see there's a a big
difference between if you're trading
with botex and trading without botex
another two of the I say the most
frequent play you will see is you are
typically we run into a tickers with
really low floats and there are biotechs
and there is tons of warrants and that's
ready to be executed and there's
offerings pretty much on all of The
Botch uh botch they do reverse splits
and they do offering they do warrants
and there's a bunch of active warrants
in the stock and the stock is trading
let's say anywhere between 1 million to
5 million float and these type of
tickers they typically do not perform
very well because if you see there's
active warrants that's ready to go and
sometimes the company doesn't have to
issue the warrants in that specific day
and if you short a big size based on
warrants you're going to end up with a
massive squeeze so majority of the time
when you see a bunch of wors you see
botch they just fade completely 90% from
the top you are looking at yourself say
I should have sized in after market open
after I tracked about in The Last 5
Years of all the BX I fed the front open
and sometimes they don't execute their
warrants and the stock just Spike
massively 100% 200% in terms of shorting
strategies I do not recommend it short
if the stock has wors and you're
shorting after open because if you're
looking at in the long-term
consistencies it's not going to perform
that well and if you make money let's
say the tickers has a low float and you
short it at the open it has a bunch of
warrs ready to go and you fade it let's
say all the way down to where it begin
to spike yesterday then uh you will make
40% 50% re again and next time if they
choose not to execute their warrants and
you short after open instantly 30 40%
pushing percentages after open then you
will be down massively without having a
potential exit because the stock is HED
all the time so that's not a very
consistent strategies so in terms of
going into long terms I do recommend
avoid all of The Botch only focus on
Technologies don't trade energies as
well uh so botex energies those are I
would say the two sectors you do not
want to touch any other sectors are okay
to trade with those are the performance
sheets uh for 2023 all right here are my
account statements through out the year
let's take a look at the entire year I
have actually five red month this is
probably the worst years of probably my
entire trading career typically on of
the trading months I only have any
average between two to three maximum
four of the red months and this year I
had a total of five I'll say there is
not many trading opportunities to be
honest other than January and the
February tickers pretty much throughout
of entire 2023 we had a very very
aggressive uh short squeezes
unpredictable tickers and tier just
straight gaps down they're leaving no
opportunity to short and throughout the
entire year I say on December close to
the end of the year the market is
breaking into alltime high uh I think we
had a few of the lowf flow tickers but
in terms of Octobers and November we
don't really have that much and I've
been trading with biotex especially
struggling with botex and they decide to
take them out completely starting around
September the only biggest month was in
May I think we had tons of Bounce shorts
and GAP up shorts and uh we had F FRC
that's the bankruptcy tickers April we
had TP and megl that was a ticker that
went to 200 then we had uh bbos I
believe that was another biotech went to
I think was $2 to $50 so those crazy
squeezes also in June and uh July we had
Ocea and there's another botch so pretty
much half the losses came from botch and
there's one ticker I actually got caught
with which is top I didn't get squeeze
all the way from 17 to 200 I think I
short it around 19 covered around 22 23
is before the close it's pretty big size
I think that's the losses came from
April and going I would say the starting
from June to December all we had was
btics low floats micro floats and
tickers that do not provide enough
liquidity to short all the ticket that
we being experiencing are anywhere
between $3 to $7 it's not like we
typically run into the tickers in 2021
the average prices we're trading at will
be 10 to 20 and now we're dealing with
much lower price stocks and also lower
volume so there's not much room to say
in big going to the year of 2024 since
the FED is cutting rates and economy
should turn back around very quickly and
we will see how the market performs and
also if the rates are dropping down the
money will be flowing back into the
market we should experiencing more
liquidity that's being injected into the
market for a summary of 2023 first of
all do not size in very aggressively
make sure you pay attention to the
volume pay attention to the float and
also do not try to deal with botex even
though they have tons of warrants if
their floats are between 700k to 3
million once they decide not to execute
their warrants on that on that specific
day they want to execute on that second
day then you will run into a ticker that
squeezes 500% from the open likeo seea
so one of those tickers will work out
dur entire your play those tickers are
not worth it other than that do not hold
tickers overnight and uh that will be
the summary of the entire year of 2023
and let's take a look at the most recent
tickers that happened in December first
of all let's go through sntg this one's
a 1 milum float it has uh two layers of
resistance one is around I believe is
around four starting around four goes
all the way up to six there's another
resistance uh I think is around eight
first layer of resistance is 24 million
second layer is 15 million I would say
it didn't really ignor the $4 resistance
it pulled back and reinspected all with
eight to the secondary resistance then
form the longer consolidations so for
all those low flow takers you always
want to wait for a longer consolidations
typically these type of uh up and down
actions are not consolidations at all
and even though the terer has resistance
if the terer has a low flow under 3
million and the market cap is extremely
low and also the stock is easier to
borrow and on sntg this one is also on
SSR that's the reason why we broke
through the first layer of resistance
and Faded in after hour for low floats
and crowded volume with lower market cap
always wait for consolidations you can
see pretty much all of those stickers
smfl lower folds form the longer
consolidations then crack down then we
had another sidu 700k float formed the
two hours of consolidations then crack
down so those stickers are shortable but
you have to wait for consolidations
shorting into those pushes after a
massive fade around 11 those are not
very uh profitable consolidations is the
priority for low floats all right guys
that'll be the recap and the summary of
the entire year of 2023 I wish everybody
Happy New Year's and of course check out
your own ACC sement and look at your own
mistakes to see which one is necessary
losses which one is not and uh try to
fix your mistakes going forward into
2024 and other than that I will see you
guys in the next

hello guys ster welcome to this video So
today we're going to go over a couple of
The Rounders that happened in the last
couple days it's been a little bit more
active compared to the last 2 months
let's see what we can do to make trades
profitable and before I start this video
make sure to click the like button and
subscribe let's get into it so the first
one we have is atgl this is considered
as a multi- Runners that is uh currently
running on IPO and there's a couple
things that you want to take into
considerations when you are trading IPOs
first one is market cap and Float
typically or 80% of the time they're not
very accurate so everything is based on
the volume and the Char actions that IPO
can behave very similar to a micro float
even though the float is over let's say
10 million to 20 million when you are
trading IPOs make sure there is enough
liquidity now what do I mean by enough
liquidity is on the current intraday the
stock at least needs to trade about four
mini shares or more more intraday level
so let's take a look at the highest
volume on atgl 2.7 million so it did not
exceed 4 million which is not considered
shortable the liquidity is not there and
we have experienced HKD uh in the last 2
years uh there is a big issue with
liquidity problems and if you're are
shorting with large size it's impossible
to get out without taking a huge loss uh
first one is you are basically pushing
the stock price second the spread is way
too far and you are not going to get a
very good executions on it so atgl is
looking very similar to HKD and I would
stay away as far as possible and we want
to see at very least trading around 10
minute shares a day very similar that's
going to be very similar compared to the
fs on uh the rounds in August so you can
see the bond is actually trading 15
million shares a day 12 million shares a
day and it's trading around $90 a share
the total um amount of dollar was traded
on the peak of the candle is around 1
billion so we want to see at least
ticker like atg trading 20 mini shares
around $50 is maybe 10 mini shares
around $100 we will see how far this one
can go it definitely this is not the
first red day uh there's no
consolidations the volume was way too
small so whenever we want to judge a
consolidations a ticker needs to trade
at least 5 Min shares or 2 mini shares
within 2 to 3 hours not consolid in for
the entire day which is 7 to 8 hours
without only trading around 800k shares
that's the recap for atgl then let's
take a look at optx this is also I
believe is IPO as well first screen day
typically when we're running into IPOs
we do not want to trade first Green Day
we also want to avoid second green day
as well we want to see either first red
day that's after a huge amount of volume
which is intraday over 4 million or we
want to see a massive dollar block which
look like VFS and optx has not performed
either of the two actions so it is not
considered to be tradeable and what
we'll have to wait for in the next I'll
say 3 to four days to see how it's
really going to trade and uh we can
judge the chart from there then let's
take a look at the last one which will
be
SGD this sticker is running up from
Thursday from 0.5 to all the way to 10
so it's up about 2,000% in total on the
second Green Day so first of all when
we're looking at the IPO first second
Green Day either we want to see a 50%
fade in the pre-market actions then we
want to shorten the push but you can see
that the entire ging percentages is
around uh 2 to 10 so if you want to see
a 50% of the entire range around 2 to 10
which will be at 5 so ticker needs to
fade all the way back to five then Spike
up to 10 you will be shortable but this
one kind kind of Consolidated around 8
to 9 so it didn't really consolidate or
didn't really pull back 50% so what
we're looking at is we want to see long
consolidations or a massive weaknesses
with a huge reversal typically when
we're looking at a straight fade like
SGD today we're not going to see it very
often because first of all the volume
was at 10min shares before the market
open the entire volume estimated the
volume is around 100 million so that
makes the stock very crowded and is very
easy for stock to reverse and trade lot
more volumes and cause a massive short
squeezes so as a short Setters you want
to avoid A Low Flo with very crowded
volume in the pre market so with how
much volume I traded on the current day
since I did not place a trade on SGD
even though I bought shares did formal
consolidations around six so let's see
on the following day if the stock gaps
up all the way to six or gaps up to
eight it will be a very shortable ticker
uh using the previous day resistance I
think you traded around 20 to 30 million
shares and uh you will be a decent
opportunities if it pushes up to six but
if it doesn't then you will be a waste
opportunities now personally I believe
that if you place the shore around 8 or
7 after market open and you made the
profit and and you know for the entire
day fade which I do think it is a very
low chance that tier can fade in the
second Green Day with crowded volume it
will not fade 50% like this so I will
think it's a money that's made by luck
and typically that money was made by
luck you will always attend to lose it
in the next trade that'll be the trade
Solutions in the upcoming days for SGD
that'll be the entire recap for this
week and if you have any questions
please leave a comment below and other
than that I will see you guys next
week

hello guys steven dux here welcome to
this video today
i will be reviewing of the mistakes and
some of the biggest losses i made in
and this is something that i regularly
do uh yearly so i will be able to
identify
which one is avoidable losses which one
is unavoidable
this is a very important step for me to
become a consistent profitable trader
so i think it's also important to you as
well
and before i start this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
and let's get into the video so the
overall process will be split in three
different parts
the first part will be of the losses and
mistakes you made
second part will be all of the
consistent winning trades
that you made throughout the year the
third part which is the most important
part for beginners is you want to select
all the trades
that belong to scalping or small trades
you made about 500 or a thousand dollars
and these are considered to be small
trades for your account
now you want to identify them does these
small trades fit any type of pattern now
if it's not fitting any type of pattern
or some of the pattern you want to
potentially test
then those trades counts you are over
trading in this market so once you can
filter that out as a beginner then
it will be a very good step for you to
become a consistent profitable trader
in this video i will be go overing all
the mistakes that i made
some of the trades that stands out and
i'm very stubborn about and sizing way
too much
and also some of the biggest wins that i
made throughout the year so you can kind
of see that
how do i really react if i'm winning big
or i'm taking a huge losses
so in this way you can get used to the
mindset that you are winning
and also if you are losing you will be
able to find out okay this is
something that i did before i will try
to avoid it into the next time uh when
i'm trading in real time
so that'll be uh of the concept i'll
give you guys
let's get into uh the recaps all right
so there's going to be two tickers i
want to talk about
uh obon this one will be i'll say one of
the biggest mistakes that i made i
caught losses
way too late let's look at the yearly
chart this sticker
had over 200 minute resistance around
two to three dollars the major
consolidation area is between
2.5 to 2.7 in that day
when i talk about shorting into
resistance
i always avoid stocks under three
dollars so on obln
it's stuck between two to three dollars
it's on the high twos
and the low 3 area so it barely
qualified the criteria
of shorting into resistance which i
still
sized in full amount risking
the 3 dollar area i think the stock
opened
over 3 opened around 3.4 it traded about
the 100 million
shares before 10 30. if you are trying
to estimate the entire day volume
if in the first hour already traded
about 100 million shares
it's definitely going to trade more
shares throughout the day and it's also
going to overwhelm
the 200 million resistance that was made
in december 7th in 2018 2019 we never
get
any resistance that is close to 200
million resistance
so i sized in about i would say 500 000
worth of positions i think i took around
20 losses so that's like a hundred
thousand one hundred fifty thousand
losses on this specific ticker
so in the future what i can improve on
is if the stock is trading over 100
million
shares before 10 30 and it's definitely
going to trade more than 200 million
shares
throughout the day and i will try to
size down because sometimes the stock
decides to
do a massive pull and actually
consolidate
around the resistance then drop so in
that case if the volume is too much
try to size down as much as possible i
would recommend 20 percent of your
regular size
for this type of shorting strategy so
for wnw
this is another massive wing that i did
i was
very patient on the sticker because
during that time there is a massive ipo
hype in that two months so
the stock did when very overextended
went from seven to 160
uh in three days let's look at the
intriguing chart
so we'll be able to tell where the entry
is and where
is the exit so first of all when the
stock is
spiking in the afternoon there's always
a really good chance that stock tends to
perform a massive morning spike
so for wmw because it is a very fresh
chart
and they attracted a lot more volume
after the open
the stock went from 50 to 160
pretty much in 30 minutes once it formed
the top it dropped another 50 percent
from the 160 so it dropped all the way
to 80
so in this case when people are buying
around 160 they're
down way too much so they want to sell
into some type of consolidations or
balances
and the consolidated about 2 million
shares around 100
so that's about 2 billion in terms of
dollar block
which i decided sizing around 120
covered around 102
then because of the borrow fee was way
too expensive to hold overnight assassin
again
into the next day morning average is
around 103 covered
on the low of the day close to 72.73
so that's the two trades that i made on
wnw
both of the trade i made over 20
from my original investment so i think
that's a
decent gain and also one thing to keep
in mind that a multi-day runner
tends to fade anywhere between 50 to 75
percent
now 80 percent of the multi-day runner
tends to only fade about 50 percent
now the rest of the 25 percent doesn't
really happen not often
so for wnw specifically
it covered when the stock faded around
50 percent
but in some cases that this type of
ticker tends to fade
75 which you can see that when it
dropped it to
the low 30s that's
in total about 75 of the entire game
oblan is one of the biggest losses that
i made in 2020 and also wnw
is one of the biggest game that i made
last year uh hopefully you guys can
learn something new about
my thought process on obon and wnw
overall i think the market is going into
a bigger volume sector
so what you have to do is go look at
your losses and to see what you can
improve on
and also look at your wins to make sure
that what you can do to
keep your consistency so that will be
all for this video thank you very much
for watching i will see you guys
in the next one

hello guys steven next here so i know i
haven't done a video for a long time but
today i want to kind of give my thoughts
about the general market
uh especially between last year and this
year and how everything has changed
especially upon for the penny stock
statistics and overall about the general
market
and before further ado uh let's get into
the video and also make sure hit that
like button and subscribe
let's get into the video
all right so
let me talk about the general market
first uh
i know pending stocks or small caps are
generally not really related to the
overall market but uh for this year is
kind of
special is because that the federal
reserve has printed trillions of dollars
i think 60 to 80 of our money was
printed
uh in the last two years that amount of
money has
especially popped up the market
recovered
from the pandemics and all that excess
money got pumped into the market in 2021
that's when we had dwac
and
uh tons of
tickers that's running like thousands
and thousands of percent in one day and
also been running a thousand percent on
billion dollar cap that we have never
seen in the last five years uh that
includes amc and gme it has been over
six months the federal reserve stopped
printing money and all those money are
being drawn now you can see that dwsc
lost about fifty percent
from the top
or more than
eighty percent seventy percent ish then
we had uh gme and amc lost over
eighty percent from the top
and all the stickers will continue to
fade as the bubbles start being popped
on the bigger caps when you are looking
at the rhythm of the general
small caps we had about 70 to 80
small caps play
each year and we have about
uh between 10 to 15
of the stickers that can run up to 2 000
3000 percent and can provide a great
shorting opportunities but in this case
we don't really have that uh
it's been about over you know half a
year the only thing we saw was a
gme amc bounce shore and
and some tickers here and there that
running about 200 percent
and majority of the tickers has been
running has literally no volume
so the volume comparison between 2021
and 2022
is about 10 to 1. so that is
a significant drop
with without the federal reserve keep
giving out free money to the retails and
buying stock market with no brain so
now let's take a look at the general
market which is the smp
smp i normally don't trade this one at
all and you can just see that every
single dip
from my personal research
has been held up by the government
assistant
so every time when they hold up the
stock market they have to either reduce
interest rate or they have to create
money
so
now it has come to a point that the
federal reserve cannot keep printing
money
because the demand is too high
i mean it certainly can and it will
cause a hyperinflation like our right
now inflation has been
uh kind of crazy so if you keep printing
money then there's no hope and the
interest rate is already at zero so it's
going uphill from here i know you can go
into a negative interest rate area but
that's
certainly not a good idea so
when i look at the market a lot of
people tend to look at
yield curves
bank interest i tend to look at the
market in a general term about how much
is the entire market worth i know
there's there's tons of factors in the
overall market and this is the reason
why trading
the smp is really difficult because
there's way too much factors that's
being involved in this market and
it's
extremely difficult to to time this
market also
that's why
majority of people lose
trading these
etfs and they tend to buy it and hold
for long periods of time that's how they
you know make their strategy work but in
terms of in terms of trading short term
uh seasonally
it's relatively difficult so right here
i'm going to give my general thoughts
about how those smp can be
related to the small caps
so whenever you see the small capsule is
dying now especially with a significant
volume drop
and not a lot of people are withdrawing
from the market whenever we're drawing
from small caps they're going to
withdrawing
from the mid caps then to the big caps
that's how the
market works as you can see
a bunch of the companies are slowing
down netflix paypal facebook
and we're slowly approaching into the
much bigger cap the last season we had
amazon
so all those earnings are
is the sign of the economy is slowing
down with the upcoming quantitative
tightening
that's going to affect the market even
more so we're going to see some type of
drawdown
um just like we had in 2022 but not as
no dropping 20 20 30 in two weeks but we
should have some type of similar actions
in uh
i would say
between three to six months and after
that uh the market eventually will
credit itself and starts to recover
that's when we have all the
opportunities in the world to either dip
by
and
also be able to
catch all the small caps because when
the market is recovering that's when the
market has the most play that every
single small cap is going up hundreds of
thousands of percent that becomes agree
of shorting opportunities later
but uh you can see during 2020
after march
especially after april we had
10 to 15 tickers between
april to october that's when all the
small caps and mid caps tends to run
thousands and two thousand percent in
one day
and for all the small caps
traders out there uh make sure be
patient don't try to rush in because the
volume is definitely not there when the
volume is really low you cannot size in
as much as
you you know try the sizing in 2021.
the volume is completely gum so right
now try to
be conservative and whenever you are
seeing a ticker that's going up 100 200
percent
um and when the bomb is really low make
sure
let me give you example about um one of
the tickers that happened
last week sidu this is a classic gap up
short it went from 3.5 to 4.5 i gave you
about
the opening is four so went to 4.5 it
gave you about 10 push after the market
open the general statistics in 2021 for
gap up short tends to push up to 20 to
30 percent in the first
half hour to 45 minutes so that
statistics has significantly dropped
with the four dollar only dropping only
pushing up about 10 percent that's
really weak compared to the statistics
in 2021 and also you can see that the
stock is trading 95 million volume
throughout the day and the stock dropped
to 50
so when the stock tends to get really
crowded it
becomes really short heavy
and
uh they either pull back and consolidate
and re-break out later in the day uh in
or they just don't move throughout the
day and drop in the next day but in this
case the volume is definitely not there
and when the stock is trading tons of
long and still dropping
that means the current market condition
is not as great compared to before
and another factor is
majority of the gap offshore their
maximum pulling back prices is around
three to four dollars
as i mentioned in the previous video
that if the stock tends to drop
uh into the two to three dollar zone
that's where stock becomes a little bit
too cheap and a lot of retailers can buy
tons of shares
and
from there it becomes really difficult
for a star to drop especially below
three dollars and when you are seeing
penny stocks gap up short dropping under
three dollars that's a really very sign
that tends to tell you that in the
following
place if you see the same thing
happening on sidu
multiple times you will have to adjust
your current strategy that to pull down
your um
max reward price so whenever i see a
ticker going from let's
say uh six dollars to three dollar three
dollars is normally my cover point
because i do not think
it will go lower than that even though
the statistics is showing you that
typical gap up sure can fade
75 from the top
so
in this case even though the stock only
faded at 50
and it's dropping to the three dollar
area i will still cover
and you know give up my 25
reward
by the end of the day
because that's the maximum drop in price
right now
you will kind of have to adjust your
statistics
down to the two to three dollar area
probably the low to use to be able to
get the max reward so i'm still tracking
tons of statistics but currently
everything is changing and
also
with the general market i'm expecting
that
the second
half after the year there is going to be
much more slowdown and probably no place
on penny stocks
and
probably more panic
on the overall market then we should
have a recovery by the end of the year
or the beginning of next year so
alright guys that'll be the end of this
video thank you very much for watching i
will see you guys

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys do next here welcome to this
video so today I'm going to go over my
22,000 profitable trades that I placed
last week and also trade that I missed I
think I missed about another 50,000 and
I'm going to go over pretty much all my
thought process for those two trades and
before I start this video make sure you
click the like button and subscribe and
also we have a sale going on for the
holidays so make sure check out the link
below and let's get into the video so
the first one I want to go over is H hot
this is the tier that I missed now
whenever you want to spot on Multi
Runners you want to actually know where
the extension started with and it's
typically started after a red day in
between so the extension can only be
count starting around 2.4 goes all the
way to 7.6 uh typically we need 300%
extensions for multi- honors so
2.4 * 3 that's 7.2 so just barely met
the minimum 300% extension and the here
is the mass of first red day so the
reason why I missed this trade is it
traded about 80 million shares before it
performed the massive first red day
right here and first of all uh I want to
check out where is my maximum profitable
point and typically is 25% above the
neutralized area so where I'm looking at
will be around the $ 4ish so right here
2.4 or 3.4 is the neutralized area then
we have another consolidations around
four I would assume that maximum can
only fade around 24 or maybe 3.7 but it
faded all the way back to 2.7 the
neutralized area it dipped through the
neutralized area so that's the one that
I wasn't expected and I was waiting for
a push on shot because there wasn't any
consolidations from the previous day so
starting around
6.5 if I'm placing a short around six my
risk will be 7.5 and I think that risk
is kind of too wide maximum size I will
be willing to comfortable sizing in is
probably around 20K to 30k and I will
probably exit around 4 the low 4ish so
I'll make about $2 a share and 20K
shares I'll be around 40K in terms of
profit just by looking at the chart
today I should have set in some of the
shares that I borrowed because it's
definitely worth a small size even
though the risk is way too wide if
there's a consolidations of course you
can say 50k 60k shares I think goes on
that Friday the risk is too much and
there is a drastic difference on the
volume because yesterday traded 80
million shares and starting from um
Friday you only traded about 7 minut
shares I think before 10:00 so it's not
going to uh compete with the previous
day volume that's why the stock dropped
massively and in terms of the maximum
reward typically tiers don't multi-day
Runner Do not drop this far that's the
trade that I missed so the 20K trade
that I placed which is SGD the overall
profits is around 21,000 12,000 on
success Traders and 9,000 on trade zero
this is my executions on SGD and of
course we typically be want a 50%
extensions on a bound Shore the
consolidations on SGD is around 5 to $6
doish majority around six and uh we're
seeing ticket going from 2.2 5 to5 b so
that's extensions about 100% uh I
setting a little bit early because I
haven't seen a boun short for a very
long time so I size thing very small I
think was 5,000 shares here and 25,000
shares around 4.5 so my average is total
is right around right here so 4.25 uh
420 to 4.25 covered around uh 4.75 so
only made about 50 cents on this chart
this is where the 22k came from not a
too big of a trade because the ticker
only faded about 50% this is a classic
boun Shore and shot it is a first red
day on a multi-donor pattern so
hopefully you can see more of those
official pattern that's been coming out
recently and uh I wish everybody have a
great trading for the last month of the
year all right guys thank you very much
for watching I will see you guys in the
next
one

this wasn't going to be my first
question but how old are you I'm 25
years old so I'm not that far from you I
have grandchildren probably as old as
you are has anybody ever thought you
were lying like when you mentioned it to
them well my neighbor think I'm a drug
deer do you think it's ethical to
accumulate so much wealth and not give
back to society well it depends on how
they accumulate their wealth and if
they're helping people while
accumulating wealth I think it's ethical
this is an
oversimplification but if you made $2
million it might be fair to say that 20
people lost
$100,000 are you okay with that a very
interesting question it's a very

what's up Tim Sykes millionaire mentor
and trainer here with Stephen Docs
thanks for coming to Miami dude thank
you
freaking awesome two days I mean study
we learned we prepared yesterday today
you made how much forty two thousand
forty two thousand dollars now what do
you have to in total profits one point
seven one point seven one point seven
meetings one point seven million
I love all my top students like they say
like you know when timber Tommy past a
million he's like you know I passed 101
you didn't pass one you passed 1 million
timber Tommy is now closing you know six
million tail you've done all of this in
two years what is your secret tell us
please Tingler Tony learn from others
and the ash tree speed-up he's learning
curves and I've learned from tingoora
Tommy yeah and you of course she's to
speed up my learning curve so that's why
I'm a successful stuff successful rate
is a little bit faster than others by
learning from other people you can speed
up your own learning curve it's
basically what you're saying yes and I
agree that's the beauty of what I think
my challenge is all about because you
have the advantage of learning for me
Timber Thani mark coke
Michael good we're all making video
lessons and webinars how many webinars
do you think you've watched countless
maybe 100 I'll say yeah oh I can't
really remember the numbers I watch them
every day
I just mean I see you're studying what
do you think the biggest lesson that
you've encountered along the way you
have to learn how to be patient how to
not get emotional and always try to cut
losses quickly rule number one always
cut losses quickly I might not have made
$42,000 today and yesterday yesterday I
had one bad trade but I made I guess
roughly three thousand dollars between
the past two days so I'm a little more
conservative you're a little more
patient and aggressive and that's fine
there's different
whether you make three thousand and two
days or forty thousand two days both
both are fantastic it's all profits it's
all profits right so what do you think
the toughest lesson for you has been
cutting losses cloquet that I think
that's the toughest lessons really yeah
so you just like let it run sometimes if
sometimes you let your emotional says
I'm gonna go into this trade and without
any patterns you are going because you
want to go in yeah then the stock turns
against you and you have to keep adding
and adding that's where the big losses
come from what do you think most people
you know a lot of people reach out to
you what do most people have issues with
they can't control your emotion control
their emotions because when they see a
stock goes up they want to chase it when
it's the stock goes down they want to
short it yeah but it happens the
opposite when you when the stock is
going up you are tend to be shorting it
because if I can get a better entry yeah
so control your emotion it's the best
it's counterintuitive to yes you in
order to really succeed you have to do
the opposite of what you feel yes and
that is so difficult you know it's very
difficult because of the human nature
it's human nature but all the best
lessons this is why I say like in order
to have patience to wait for the best
trade I think of myself as a retired
trader thank you I'm a full-time trader
I'm a coach I'm trading nearly every day
but I think of myself as no I don't need
to train I'm only going to come out of
retirement if there's a trade that's
good enough that will make me feel
guilty that I'm retired yes you have to
think of that way too because when you
miss opportunities you think you miss so
much money but you can't think that that
way that that way will destroy your
account
I would rather miss a trade than trade
too much and take shitty trades yes how
do you overcome this teach us how to be
patient to be patient I think he needs
practice second you uh you can't be too
rush to make money and like nothing
comes really fast so here's the man who
made nearly two million dollars in two
years I don't think is that fast but
Bitcoin has had bit going with VAT don't
bring up big would have been the single
biggest boom in the past few years
tinker Tommy was closing in on six
million made no money for nine months
why did you make so much money when he
made nine what is your secret
never fronting go Tommy is a great point
so Tim Kotani had me and Michael good to
learn from but you have great ani me
Michael good and Mark troq so the more
students and now you know other
challenged students have you to learn
from so as we keep creating more and
more success stories your education gets
easier yes you have more different
examples because we're all slightly
different yes so you're a speaker biz
much faster yes yes give me a faster
faster what do you think is the best
thing to do right now in 2018 because
last time we talked it was a different
market what's what's different now right
now the market is very volatile so yeah
there's a lot of opportunity up there
and you don't have to don't have to be
rush into the opportunities be patient
wait for the right opportunity to come
and go for it what do people do while
they're waiting because we have a lot of
people with itchy fingers like they want
to make a trade like their money is just
sitting there they want to get rich what
do you do when you're not trading well
we are trading you have to understand
what you're doing so learning while
you're free you feel waiting there you
just pull up a video lessons call up a
webinar and watch and learn and it's
better to learn than lose money and
going to the matic itself do you hear
this guy I say this every day maybe with
a soft-spoken accent maybe that's what
it's gonna take you to do it my point is
that when there's no great play most
people are sad right they're like oh
there's no great play and I say no this
is a good thing this gives you more
opportunity to study so that you can be
better prepared for when the next play
is there I totally agree because when
people are tired of waiting there's
nothing happy in the market and then if
you're studying you're confident you go
you will be you will be confident enough
to go
next play and we are more confident you
have more patient thing that's you get
more profits if there was a hot play
right now I would say that most people
wouldn't even be properly prepared to
capitalize on it
I don't you feel tried to rush into it I
don't think you can pop you can't profit
if I'm correct so there might be a hot
plate right now in some newbie who
hasn't studied the DVDs in the webinars
and video lessons okay there's a hot
plate what do I do
yeah because they're not prepared yes so
our job is to prepare you ahead of time
right that's why we have so many DVDs
and video lessons that's why you came
out with your own guide now - mm-hmm
so study is the key studying is the key
as you always say oh one other question
actually I got a question for you
because I I ask people I'm like oh I'm
gonna talk with Stephen ducks wait for
this question when you see this is from
mark in New Hampshire thank you for
writing in mark Stephen so long question
what is what is the the best software to
use for finding stocks that's betrayed
there we go
so I mean there's more to it and in what
what are the scans that you use he's
basically asking the only skin you need
to do is just top person gainer
finding the hottest stocks and just
thought about everybody's watching what
you use stocks to trade yes and I highly
encourage you guys to do it because the
big percent gainers are good but I you
know we take it a step further there's
40 scans built into stocks to trade yes
so for me I like using different ones
like the big percent dangers are
but also like 8% Gators over three days
or five days or you know different
things like that
yeah but very you find the mark every
single day you will no class doctor trip
and some people are yeah you have to
understand so we have students all over
and there they have different you know
schedules some people can't be in front
of the markets every day yeah
so you can create your own criteria at
ISKCON you can create your own criteria
do you do that
yes how many different criteria do you
use not that many for skin only but I
use criterias for surety - whirring
stops but I find that simple works
pretty well yes like again this is
counterintuitive like people are okay
like okay there's 500 indicators let me
plug them all in yeah I mean if I use
some of these indicators I would just
lose my mind yeah we are trendy have to
keep as simple as possible for you to
understand not trying to be super
complicated no kiss kiss keep it simple
stupid okay what's really well
it really works in the stock market yeah
he does work yes yeah all right one
thing we have to go the markets gonna
close in a little bit I want to get back
just in case there's any overnight place
one tip for people watching this your
best tip aside from studying aside from
having patients what's your third tip
because those are two big ones there's
lots of examples like us four people are
getting successful really quick if you
want to be successful you have to you
have to work harder than us so not many
people can be successful in trading a il
of ten people lose money so we're not
good yeah or not series so if you want
to be better than us you have to study
hard you have to follow the rules you
basically need to be better than better
than us to be fat to get up fast for
success it's true and you have to learn
the rules in order to follow a lot of
people don't know the rules yet what
rules do you follow that's why we teach
the civic rules it's all about
preparation and discipline
you're only as good as your training
plan and if you have no training plan
what are you gonna do you're probably
not gonna do well you might have a good
trade you might have a bad trade a lot
of it is luck yeah would you say that
you planned meticulously on every trade
yes every single trade I go in I have a
plan I have my risk level if it goes off
my risk level I cut it and when you cut
it you have a loss but you this last you
have to pick you have to be you have to
be really comfortable with so trader
stop stock market like on opportunities
the last are like if you take a loss
it's acceptable because you know you
will make it bad your winning percentage
is there always trust yourself be
confident thank you sir this guy is so
incredible check out his new guide we'll
post a link just below this video learn
the rules learner patience understand
this is a marathon not a sprint you will
not necessarily become a millionaire
like this guy within two years some
students take longer and that's fine
think about oh this is what I want to
say I've been saying this to a lot of
students let me know what it how it
sounds I say what can you do today in
tomorrow this week and next week and
this month that will serve you well over
a year from now or two years from now
meaning if you make a thousand dollars
today it doesn't matter
like a year from now but if you make a
thousand dollars on a trade today
following a plan and then you use that
same plan with a bigger account a year
from now that thousand dollars maybe a
year from now might be a ten thousand
dollar profit yes you scale up over time
have you been scaling up I've done
really a scale in the market I have been
patient but from the beginning let's go
back to the beginning when you first
started you were not taking the position
sizes that you take now yes so you got
comfortable with the rules you got
comfortable with the patterns
then once you've found that comfort
level once you saw a working time and
again that's when you felt more
comfortable to take bigger positions yes
so don't take big positions in the
beginning I would rather you
paper-trained on stocks to trade or take
small positions practicing honing your
techniques you have to understand you
can't grow a bigger account when you
can't not grow a scratch yes oh my god
that is the best point when you have a
small account focus on learning how to
grow that small account you're not going
to go from a thousand to a million all
at once try to go from a thousand to
five thousand and then 5,000 to 10,000
and and 10,000 to 30,000 then 30,000 new
100,000 then once you have already
proven yourself you have the process now
you understand it's the same exact stuff
just with bigger positions later on I
think that that's actually a good thing
like for people to break it down because
they see us like o millionaires but you
have to start small yes and then it you
know can get bigger over time yep
all right we gotta go trade thank you
for joining in Cheers thank you

90 to 95% happens in the morning oh
there's there's a 5 amp I let scratched
even dogs here today we're gonna talk
about a little bit people ask me about
should I go in full-time in trading or
part-time in trading and that will be
considered in that question very
seriously because I have thought about
going full-time I think was three years
ago after I got off the college at that
time I don't really have the full
experience about the market because when
you are going to industry as I said you
needed three to four years of practice
to be able to be able to know every
single aspect of this industry and to be
able to be profitable and when you are
going in one or two years that is the
time zone that where you get super
confident and they just want to switch
it this euro job and going full-time
with day trading now what I experienced
from all those four years in the first
one or two years I have pretty much
spend a lot of hours on screen time so
932 for pretty much eight hours every
single day for the first couple of the
first two years then I got handled in
and to start practice my patterns and
how to really utilize the best winning
percentages and how to really take
advantage of people psychologists and
all that so it took me another half a
year to get so down with all those
technique and then I pretty much spend
about one or two hours right after
market open so if there's a low flow
then we get up little bit early I has to
be mooted or honored out so if the first
screen day has low flow I wasn't really
interested for insures so I'm not really
getting up that early
then for better flow you can pretty much
brochures when you can get up I get up
before I started like teaching I get up
at 9:20 so when I get up at 9:20 I spend
about five minutes to look at the market
and is there like a twenty top percent
gainers is any beginners that is over
twenty percent you here it is it doesn't
long and fits other criterias
pretty much takes me about two minutes
to go over pretty much all the tickers
and on the stopwatch fist then play my
trade putting our through to five
minutes and once the market open I take
a trade or no if I don't take a trade I
stay about another 45
to see if there's anything pop up after
45 minutes if there's no trail I'll just
turn off the computer and enjoy rest of
the day so that's the advantage of once
you get full practice of day trading
I don't really spend that much time on
the training anymore I can use that time
to do something else and if you don't go
full time I will say at least to going
to this industry and start practice for
these two years then consider if you
want to go full-time or not and see your
record and see if you're consistent
powerful or not and so you feel up for
develop strategies and all that needs to
be considering there but I think once
you get full time and you don't really
spend that much time on trading is you
can still keep your job it's like a
two-way income traders aggressive income
and job is a passive income also there's
like three things I like about day
trading is compared to other businesses
and other industries day trading you're
looking in computer you don't really
need to communicate with people you
don't need to really talk the deals and
let's say just this house is five
hundred Alison you don't know how much
didn't cut it down by negotiating
there's a second negotiating skills I
wasn't very good
coming kidding with people so you would
look in computers and read the stops is
much better than communicating and you
don't really need to spend nine-to-five
doing the same thing over and over again
every single day
the ticker is different and the flow is
different there's little new things you
can learn every single day and you don't
really split that much time you can
trade pretty much from everywhere you
could have Wi-Fi I wouldn't suggest to
go into like super far let's say your
broker is a Bahamas or US and you're
going to you're trading on like Asia
some of the countries they plot the
Wi-Fi so you have to use VPN
trading executions exact and there are
two seconds so don't try to short or try
to buy into SSR socks especially you're
in other countries and it takes second
second to get executed so that's the
three advantages for trading hope for
you guys enjoy the videos I also have an
upcoming conference in August 17 18 19
so if you are interested watch me trade
live or communicating with me about your
trading
careers and how to really develop our
strategies I will put a link below you
can register tickets in there and
hopefully guys enjoy this video and I
will see you guys next time

================================================

what's up guys Steve induction today
we're gonna talk about other topics
other than just straight analysis for
the recent stats let me go over some of
them entirely why most day traders fail
and why 90% when they lose money by the
end of the day number one they don't
really follow statistics because we want
to go into something not have a
possibility of three things going to
happen neither does that go up two go
down or a sting in the middle and start
to consolidate and for those price
ranges
they are possibilities they're very
similar to gamble pokers and all that to
be able to study that you need to figure
out what's the exactly possibility for
you to win on this specific situation so
the reason why casinos win money and why
they open up a casino because there is a
specific art around 40% and most of the
time 60% they won that's why they open
up a casino or although casinos gonna go
out of business now the thing is why
they open up a casino because people
still go in and they think okay if I get
lucky you can still win money but that's
the wrong idea then people go into the
market is even worse because they are
using the casino mentality going to a
stock market that's why most of them
they lose money now in the market
there's even more possibilities there is
different caps different volatilities
there's different flow and all kinds of
factors will set the stock that will
give you different possibilities but for
me I personally track statistics you
will give you a specific edge to trade
in one situations if you have around
let's say over 70% of our room a and if
you go into the casino you will win
because the way casino makes money they
are based on that 65 or plus percentage
that they won't win money instead of
people who are going into the casino now
if you use that same method
adjusted by statistics if you win 70
percent of a plus at the time then you
use that method going for a long term
you will be eventually making money
that's why casinos are making tons of
money that's the basement area just
before you go into the market and that's
the number one mistakes that people
makes all the time
second people are driven by emotions
it's very predictable let's say for
example if you lost money the first
thing you will you are saying okay well
how do I make you back I want it back
and I want it back right now and the
more you rush in the market and you're
forcing yourself going to a lower odds
play then that will just give you even
more losses and eventually you're gonna
be so emotional
feel like you should give him up in the
market because you think the mark is not
for you number one statistics number two
in motion you have to be able to control
to those factors at the same time and
three you're aiming for the long term
instead of shorter because sometimes
even though let's say you're lucky you
weren't a out of ten times but it has to
be some times that you hit that 20%
three or four times as consistent in
your row sometimes I get that I get
personal frustrated my focus is on the
long term so those three four consistent
laws shouldn't affect you emotionally it
still affect me because I'm trying to
steal or come the emotion because I know
my statistics I know my edge and I know
in our turn I'll come out on top third
thing is a lot of people have come with
I had this problem before if you go on
to either social media or on Twitter and
you see all those people oh I made this
money money I made this amount of money
and people will get not jealous I think
is well you find that if they made a dis
amount of money I can't make it because
I need to catch up and people also are
feel I wanna say peer pressure or force
to making a play to want to make more
money
there are people just random people on
social media and that's the wrong
mentality because you have to focus on
yourself at the end of the day it's all
your personal performance and it doesn't
really matter what other people think
what other people have as long as you
are only focusing yourself in this
trailer communities a lot of people
seems to show either how much profits I
made and it's good to really communicate
with them to see what mistakes that are
making in some kind of situations but
those profits shouldn't affect you your
mentality of how you supposed to trade
and just peer pressure it shouldn't
affect you to force a trade so those are
the three major problems that I ran into
I think that's the three majority
problems that 90% people lose money in
the market and they give up too quickly
to be in this industry you have to be
super patient different people have
different learning curves when you are
trading the stocks you are know exactly
why I said those three maturity mistakes
since we're all human we're trying to
avoid the emotional mistakes as much as
possible but there's always a way to
really follow your rule because once you
think of non tournaments are instead of
short-term you'll feel much much more
comfortable when you are taking a loss
because just focus on short-term there
to focus on money instead of focusing on
tear that's my personal experience if
you want to know more about trading
strategies there's a guy just credit
click the link below and it will take
you straight there
it's Kearney I'm pretty sell the preset
it's gonna be a month or two down and it
and after the pre-sale and the price is
going to go higher so grab my
opportunities and hope this video really
helps tractor statistics know your edge
focus on long-term and I will see you
guys next video

SOURCE VIDEO: 3 Things I wish I knew when I started trading. [J7J1hUCC-s8].en.vtt
================================================

what's up guys Stephen duster today
we're gonna cover two topics not a lot
of people have been asking about one of
us what should you do as a beginner when
you are just going to the stock market
and what are the mistakes that people
want to avoid as a beginner three things
I should know before we go into the
market that I didn't know and they made
me stick some it even terrible it took a
lot some days so I'm going to cover all
those points and hopefully you guys
enjoy it
let's get started so the first thing I'm
gonna talk about is the broker wise a
lot of people are asking me what broker
do you use and it's more about do you
have enough shares to go along or go
short because you want to have both
options some of the time I don't have
the options to short as a beginner when
it begins I used interactive broker so
only thing is I can go long I can barely
go short on a little flow stocks that
are really really active in intraday so
later on I might eat you know prophets
did by high memory caps by OTC breakouts
then move down into a center point three
zero Cobra trading and semi traders all
those treated all those brokers they
have their own benefits and they do have
enough shares to shore and you have
those options to go long and short so
sometimes what I want to really want to
short a stock although I messed up to me
but I don't have the shares to shore and
them and I feel like the style almost be
money and once you go into the spots
because I want to play it and since I
can't go short element go long so I have
forced myself to go long then because
the song is a short obviously but I went
wrong because I don't have two options
if I want to play that greed don't wanna
be stop tuning then I took a loss of me
so that's one of the very very mistakes
that a lot of people experience I
personally experienced myself as well so
hopefully you guys can avoid that now
secondly you need to find the good
platform so
we feed each rate pearl stocks to trade
you can find all kinds of platform out
there there are general around 100 to
200 bucks a month you very depends on
which one fits you the best
I personally use a trade 0 platform and
stock straight at the same time for
platform wise anytime the platform if
you which one looks better to face the
best for you then choose that one so
next thing is how do I get started
like what I don't know anything about
the market how do you approach to the
market
oh here's how you go so at first I went
to YouTube I try to grab as much as I
can then what market cap is where what
float is there what what's the low flow
means was flow rotations and company
fundamentals all that you can find the
free on google or on youtube now the
next thing is once you figure out all of
that then you can start going to
people's courses you really depends on
because there's are there are a lot of
skin courses out there needs to be
honest a lot of people like to sodium
fix strategies and they go into
subscribers a lot of them and for people
who are you guys are experienced
aggression now fully depends on what you
believe in and I do have my own course
as well you can check it out let's say
you go into your high school and you are
learning biology and math now there's
some of the time you can tell those
comes up is not necessary and in your
heart you will note is this stuff useful
or not and but a long time you will know
okay this this is what I need to learn
it so I don't need to know you have that
you can segregate unnecessary stuff and
necessary stuff so really unimportant
and fully depends on your judgment
next thing is to find the correct books
some books recommend is a psychology of
trading is really good I basically teach
you how to manipulate people psychology
because people are trading or behind the
market like when the candles are moving
back and forth in status I can goes up
and go down there are all caused by
human moves so once you can figure it
out
people where they're thinking they can
use that's the college to counter rock
to Karen then to make a profit from
that's why 90% people lose running
temperatures and people make money
because that 10% people can know what
people is going to react
not the next thing is since a lot of you
guys can go full-time on trading and you
have to study according to your
schedules I would come in if you're a
part-time then use 9:00 to 11:00 every
single morning when there's a Friday in
the market hours to observe the market
like you need to watch by yourself try
to make some paper trade by your own and
try to get the gist of it then combine
with people who are taught you the
techniques the patterns and you know
applying to it to see if it really works
because when people teach you the
patterns you can actually test them in
the market then you can use their
statistics to see ok this pattern works
is but it doesn't work maybe some parent
doesn't work for you or it works for you
so it all depends on which one you want
to choose and there's a whole novel
strategy out there which one fits you
the best and then go for that one that'd
be the three tips as a beginners and I
would do it with more videos about how
to really trade as a beginner hopefully
this video helps and you guys have a
great holiday and we're also giving a
lot of the cell we're giving 15 to 20
percent off you are yourself if you are
interested in our courses click the link
below it will take you to our Christmas
sales and if you're a beginner we have
our training technique DVDs they
basically teach you how to recognize the
pattern each pattern has to face
specific materials I know that so if
you're interested click the link below

================================================

[Music]
lots of guys doing ups here so a lot of
people are requesting for a trading
psychology video speech alright and
today I'm going to talk about three
training hacks that you could use when
you are trying to adapt into the current
market condition how to really
innovating or inventing more patterns
and it's going to be really helpful so
before you get into this video make sure
to watch the last video and I talked
about changeable and unchangeable
factors those are very important key
points for you to remember before you
know we dive into more about training
psychology before we get into this video
make sure to hit the like button I will
really appreciate it let's get into
that's three days later let's get into
the points I don't talk about today so
the first one is there's two side you
can go either long and go either short
I'm not sure a biased ruder
so the reason why I'm much for bias
trigger is as you know I tracked a lot
express sheets and I figured out most of
the edge are existing in the shorts I
can particular long now I'm not saying
that there's no edge in a long side it
just there's not as much compared to try
to go short the reason why should has
better winning percentage is because on
small cap stocks most of the stock fell
about ninety to ninety nine percent of
the time and trying to go long
especially for a long term you will
eventually fail because the stuff will
try to fill where they begin to spike so
you don't want to really hold a small
cap stock in your long term short term I
think it's fine there's edging there as
well something like fcl we can take a
look at the chart you can try to find
out you know there's or edge about
multi-day breakout you kind of have to
swim for a couple of days in so trying
to do the intraday trades so a lot of
people are asked me well as a beginner
how they already know about trading
psychology back in 2016 I was trying to
think of way it's all really trying to
be you know I might have short bachelor
I'm a long bath trader so I when I go
into a study trying to go long and you
cannot decide on the short side as well
because market it's a very competitive
ground and shorting it's basically you
are using a counter strategy to go
against long and lonely trying to use
our counter try to go against short now
typically short squeeze happens really
really fast because it's emotional
squeeze so go along into short squeeze
you can make a really fast pocket out of
a specific ticker without going short
it's kind of have to way for a long term
and for side to fade because we're
trying to aim for the start to losing
equity and people start getting
frustrated start selling their shares so
there's a difference of how fast you can
get a specific risk reward so going on
can get faster and much better school
work I'm pretty short in terms of you
know time period now let's talk about
training psychology
we're not trying to study long majority
you weren't trying to think about you
know not people trying to go long and
people trying to go short so you know at
which time zone or which point the stock
decides to spike to and slowly start to
cover their shares causing an IRA short
sellers to cover their shirts as well
and make all the short serves panic
causing a huge short squeeze that's
where you when trying to go along in a
consolidation area we're not trying to
go along in a certain point of stock I
would try to think okay so the stock
already one parabolic and a lot of talks
are you sure that they already fell
they're holding their desperate waiting
for a start to come down now if the
stock doesn't come down they will become
more nervous because short seller
doesn't really want to hold their shares
overnight that's where it gets to the
big tricky is because overnight fees are
really expensive
they tends to cover it right before the
market close and the reason why three to
four o'clock involves a lot of
volatility in that time zone is because
shows are try to cover their shares and
lungs trying to sell their shares
because they don't want risking of
overnight offering as I said previously
if the start will parabolic plot shorts
that are stuck they're stuck in the
consolidation or adding more shares for
the start to come down if the start
decides to perk a little bit and that's
where short sellers start to get nervous
a third important you will know after
tracking up statistics that if stock
decides to spurt about a 10% 20% depends
on which market cap zones you are using
you will start causing a huge torque
squeeze especially in the afternoon
that's where you're manipulating short
surge mindset to try to take advantage
of going mom that's where trading
psychology comes into apply into the
current market condition so number one
hacks for beginner is I will suggest to
track
specific consultations on today I will
say three hours or longer and that's
where you can figure out if the shorts
are nervous or lungs are nervous in
specific situations I'll put them into
you know certain spreadsheets and trying
to figure out the options between 3:00
p.m. to 4:00 p.m. that's where you can
take advantage of short sellers or
people trying to go along that's number
one number two trading psychology also
involves interchangeable factors and
unchangeable factors unchangeable
factors are something like flow markabs
ohms offerings and words
all those type of factors are not
changeable so when the stock already did
some typing but as I talked about last
time you can manipulate the psychology
or people that were stuck in a stop and
trying to get out that's where you are
manipulating people already went along a
year to year ago and they're stuck in a
really low price they do want to take
their losses and they're willing for a
start to come back to the original area
for them to you know cut it even to make
a profit the first one you're trying to
take advantage of people with that or
stuck into intraday consolidation second
one is you are trying to take advantage
of people without holding a long term so
the third one you can be treated as a
factor in country as a psychologist well
and the main factor about it it's called
volume and the volume is how many shares
is trading on intraday you can use that
type of factor to compare with people
without trying to go long or short to
figure it out you know what's the best
strategy wouldn't stock hits to a
certain point you can either juice dip
buy or shorting double top now let's
dive into this specific psychology so
typical volume that were generated in
normal day or on intraday will be
anywhere between 20 million to 40
million that when saturates our large
amount of volume something that called
pretty ridiculous will be in 100 million
to 200 million that's where stock gets
super super crowded there
now when sub gets super crowded that
also means result people are having
different opinions that are going longer
going short and they're multiple
potential forgiveness can use
competiveness okay so when a city gets
more population there will be more
competitiveness in the city that also
means a lot of people have different
opinions and people are trying to go
wrong
go short there's concreting factors
involved in the stock so that is the
three hacks for trading psychology and
hopefully guys you enjoyed it make sure
to leave a question below so if you have
any questions and that'll be end of this
video so thank you very much and I will
see you guys next time
windows time will come when style makes
a major move and can be fast emotional
that's where we can take advantage of
trying to go to apply into a very
commodity stocks that will lead to you
have a mass amount of risk Oh or is
because competitiveness makes no certain
industry perfect and when there is a
certain gap or sooner
lalla opportunity were created by major
panic or major emotional mistakes that a
lot of people trying to fill in into
that opportunity that's where you know
dear by works the best when the stock
has a higher market cap or a lot of
volume

let's get him doctor well at first Happy
Holidays to you guys and we're in Hawaii
right now during the final year vacation
[Music]
so hopefully you guys are enjoying your
holiday as well so I have been getting a
lot of beginner requests what do I use
what software I use what brokerage that
I use and what kind of indicator do I
use and it's very beginning questions
and today I'm gonna go over every single
one of them and that's just to make sure
in the future nobody asked me the same
question again that just that's getting
into it if you haven't check out my
podcast with Ryan Higa so we get done by
someone you cannot feel like not very
confident so you only get happiness back
by cheering something so please do and I
did get a lot of peculiar questions of
that video so this video is dedicated
for you guys and you guys are just
coming to my channel so welcome and I do
see a lot of beginning questions from
the past few videos so you should just
starting in a recent video you won't be
able to understand what I'm talking
about whatever pattern I'm using and I
would suggest go back a year ago maybe
like six months ago to just focus on the
beginner lessons that I talked about the
tips about beginners what software here
and there but in this video I will be
covering all beginners what software
should you use what do I recommend
let's get started so first if you watch
the Ryan video and you see okay well
Stephen turn 27,000 into $900,000 in the
first year and you guys are be very very
eager to jump into this industry or in
the stock market and the answer is I
took about six months before just trying
to study using a little bit of money in
testing there and there so number one I
won't really suggest you to jump in
right away and wire your money into your
brokerage account and start trading
because you have a no idea what you're
trying to get into so before we get into
this industry make sure to take couple
month or a couple you know take time to
do your research
nerve roll is what market cap is and get
used to industry before you're really
using your real money to start now
during the first couple of months I
think you should really look into what
software should you use and what about
brokers you should use because there's a
lot of brokerage out there and they're
favoring into different traders and into
at the broker are very good for buying
they're not particularly you trade are
you super shorting but their fees are a
little bit more expensive compared to
interact your broker then followed by
certain poll
speed trader and trade zero those three
brokers has really good a barrel or how
to borrow so we are measuring shortens
something for somebody like me those
brokers are vertical for me just too
short how to pour stocks but for
exchange you have to pay really high
amount of borrow fees I think right now
the power fees are a little bit too high
I think in the future they would drop it
a little bit down especially when you
have a small account and you want to
jump in your shorting the fees will kill
you especially when you have a three
thousand dollar camera five thousand
dollar cap if you ever know anywhere
between twenty five thousand or above
yeah I will commend shorting shooting do
have better odds compared to going along
especially in the penny stock area so
that would be the suggestion for me but
I will recommend your own research first
so the third one will be platforms a lot
people are asking about well Steve and
what platform they're using this
software I started used it back in 2016
and this software do have a lot of
glitches I'm not gonna lie
the reason why I keep using them because
I got used to charting software and just
used to looking at the graphs I'm
thinking about switching in - no -
Schrader or sink or swim in the future
but for beginners there's a software for
free and you can download thinkorswim
TOS if you want to have to access to the
historical charts I think sink or swim
it's the best for you to really do the
charting research let's say a month ago
- a month ago or a year ago and you can
go back to the day that was traded hi
I'm on a volume and just download the
chart take a screenshot no drop it down
and putting your charting books the one
of the very important key component that
makes me successful I think is to go
back into these high-volume days just to
study them one by one when you started
trading high mana volume and is you know
going about 500% 1000%
and you can go into that day and just
start you the charting behavior and to
see if you can find any type of pattern
any type of edge in there because when
there's a high amount of volume that
means there's very high liquidity and
you can size in much bigger and can make
much more profit the hardest thing is to
find the pattern out of all those heavy
volume traded days and that is how I
started I go back into you know when
you're 2 years ago and also go back into
you know you can go into
a different website that found Cedars
you can go proverty so another thing you
can do you can study other people's
mistakes to study other traders mistakes
at the very beginning I try to study
notine Bertoni a lot of traders that I
think that verify their trades
they're very legit and that go into
their trades and trying to find out well
in their trading career what's the
biggest mistakes that they made since
they're started trading and that will
pull that mistakes out and draw it down
and you see where they enter whether
they exit it and it will find out okay
so this is how they think when the stock
is going against them I'll try and find
out the mindset that they were in then I
will be able to you know realize it if
the mistakes is coming to my way and I
can be able to avoid it so study other
people's mistakes is great for you know
your trading career and if you're just
starting and you're if and if you're
just studying so that'll be a great
point to study other people's mistakes
and I think it's a very good idea so I
recommend you do it as well
it's shrink all those together so first
find out the brokerage that fits you the
best
Interactive Brokers good for round you
traded are very good they're good for
cherlene and going on as well now if you
want to find that stocks are hard to
borrow speed trader certain point and
trade zero
they are generally very good and I don't
really take any permissions from this
video so those are the honest
recommendations that I use personally
and next platforms I'm do you recommend
- trader
I do recommend TOS I do recommend echo
feed they're not bad so those three
platforms are pretty suitable for people
are just trying to get in starting the
training industry and number three now
before we get started you don't go back
and find all those key historical charts
that happen that stab wound from 101 to
31 to 20 I've gained the five thousand
percent 1000% trying to study the
behavior of the chart and to know
produce our edge out of it so that's the
number three number four go back to all
the successful traders and I personally
I think I do have a very solid track
record
I do have my counselor my audited and
another person will come and it will be
timber Tony
he's the trigger I really am I around
and he sells of one of my best friend we
can download their trading record from
profit you can also find good traders
from found cedars as well that's a very
legit reading record or treating
performance site you can find great
traders in there and study their trades
find their entry find their exit and
trying to reproduce what they're
thinking or whether and method it is and
that will be a great point for you to
really start getting your experience now
meanwhile if you keep you know studying
the chart and also studying a real time
and every single morning just keep your
path from open and do exactly what I
said okay all right so you're scanning
for Congress and gainers now will be
coming personal up and screaming Solomon
Oman 50k or a plus or a hundred K or
processing the pre-market now you didn't
want to scan for you know the most down
chart sides dropping 50 percent seven
percent today
because when the stock is down that much
he was scare people away so you will not
gain as much the quality compared to the
stock that's trying to go up and we
let's go now people are no excited so in
that way you will find more productive
method or better edge in the stock
that's training much more volume so that
will be dollar tips for beginners sorry

SOURCE VIDEO: 5 Golden Tips I wish I knew before I started trading. [rRdjoCntUaE].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's what guys Stephen doctor so today
I'm going to share five golden tips
I wish have known since the beginning
doing these set of videos is to help
beginners to find the correct way to
start a trading career
so before I start this video make sure
to hit the like button and you can add
further more questions after this video
make sure to follow my instagram and
twitter and let's get started at very
beginning of my trading career i started
with about a couple hundred dollars
doing with all those etf and because i
realized there's a certain range on ets
bouncing back and forth so i was trying
to buy the low and sell high and short
the hyacinth i low so you know la around
the stock didn't really follow the
specific range i was where you expecting
turned out I wasn't very profitable but
was barely prop buyer Liverpool sounds
making twenty and thirty bucks per trade
and after i realized that i can't really
stick in front of computer and waiting
for those dips and and high to happen so
each trade that will be making about
sometimes even negative so like negative
five hundred bucks sometimes i make 50
bucks so by end of the month i was
making like five hundred per month since
i was looking for a little bit more
heavy girls so that's why i get into the
pinion stocks so penny stocks a lot of
people think it's a scam in your long
run yes either scheme penny stock it is
a scam it's because when you're trying
to bind to spinning stocks when you're
holding in for long term 99% of the
stock drop to zero so that's why the raw
age of people trying to buy in stocks
and you can use this edge to sure into a
ticker and expecting equal to 0.so
shorting is you're selling high and buy
low that means if the stock drops then
you can make money in stocks the way of
buying so number one Clips you have to
save money because most of the us-based
broker
you have to have 25,000 to start account
is because you can have that amount of
money to avoid pattern day trader rule
which is called PDT
some of the broker like trade 0 spring
trader if i have international accounts
then you can start with under 25,000 and
you don't really have the PDT rule which
is only US city
yes residents you can only trade about
four times per week if you have problem
with the starting found out was just
starting with a really low amount you
can be under PDT because we don't really
need to over trade at the beginning of
my trading career are always over trade
I trade about 14 times per day and by
the end of the day that pay too much in
commissions so if you are just getting
to as trading career I wouldn't really
recommend trading not much stay under
PDT
at least for a couple months or six
months that you should help you to
rediscover the edgeware start tracking
statistics to find where your niche
supposed to be tip number two is a lot
of people when they're looking at other
people making money they're making fifty
thousand per trade they're making one
hundred sixty thousand per month or
making like five hundred thousand dollar
amount and none of this really matters
to you you're just a beginner okay when
you are looking at this industry and you
see a bunch of money that people are
making and if you want to jump into this
full time I wouldn't really recommend it
because some of my students that this
think trading is very easy I think if
people can do it within a couple weeks I
can do it within even faster so when
they try and you jump into your trading
with full time especially when you're
jumping to your full time you are
basically having no job you have a
desire of making money it's because you
are not comfortable you are every time
we go into a stock market you'll feel
like you should make money in that day
and in that type of thoughts will forces
you to make emotional trades or choice
that it's not even your strategy in
terms of that you will be end up losing
money so at very beginning of your
trading career I would really suggest
going part-time you have a partial
income at least in your life to support
paying the bills and stuff like that
then you're more comfortable to
diversify your income and trying to make
more income your life so at that
situation you won't be so uncomfortable
with I should go in your market today I
need to make money right away so tip
number three you should build up your
back of funds because we're all human we
always make mistakes when a machine we
don't even though machines sometimes get
glitched
I always tend to build back up bones
that means when I make a profit that I
feel very comfortable with and not a
people were
think okay well I can use this property
to make more money in stock market
that's completely wrong wrong is because
when you are building a strategy at very
beginning and you're thinking okay well
I grow twenty five thousand account into
a fifty thousand dollar account then the
next style I can use this twenty five
dozen project to put into an area
investment or put into nitrate to make
another fifty thousand dollar trade in
this case your mines are completely
wrong because in training it's more
direct with money so you need to build
up your backup funds for example if you
have count one and count you on count
three count one will be twenty five
thousand County where between 5000 and
the county will be twenty five thousand
so you have three opportunities to make
it sell huge mistakes to pull up your
account and the very beginning your
trading career you should focus on
couple strategies so we are using this
backup balance that if you made a
mistake you can still come back and for
other trading day traders that they go
into your market and they made the first
big money then they just going all in
with the next trade I'll see you that's
how they lose everything that's how they
can't get up and they can't go into a
tree and create any more because they
have no more funds so I would suggest
give yourself couple opportunities to be
comfortable in this market and that's
how I do it and I feel much more
comfortable with building a backup
account
I even have about two or three backup
accounts I don't really use if I make a
huge mistakes that can still have the
chance to come back because the strategy
works really well based on statistics so
number four tips when you get into stock
market we are looking for strategies
always test yourself always simulate the
gains of the ear let's say the first one
you want to track a strategy when you're
on track how frequently happens so the
frequency number two years so how much
is the risk reward because you need the
risk reward to make money so once you
find the frequency once you find outs
the risk reward you can use them times
together and to make the simulate again
because we can't get the perfect entry
we can to get the perfect exit then the
similar game will be like let's say
twenty percent less so a lot of people
go into other programs and they're
learning strategies and they don't even
know the strategy actually work because
you never had any samples when you are
buying programs or by other people's
program always go in and test their
strategies test test
it's very important is because if you go
in using a strategy and you're expecting
for long-term gains and by the end of
the day you didn't really test realize
you don't have the sample then you did
it for let's say 50 times then you
realized okay well this strategy doesn't
work anymore and they didn't really work
at the beginning at that time you
already lost enough funds you can really
get it back
so before you put any funds into you I
would say any marquee that I really stay
or South Market always test them before
you try to go in a very beginning of my
career I didn't really test the
strategies I figured it out after one
year at the beginning I was tracking too
many strategies so those charged at
iPhones to observe the stock market and
trying to test by observing not putting
on actual data sheets then I see they
work at again and again so that's why I
stayed very profitable at the very first
year so now five tips always fit
creative
so now if I got none fight it's always
be creative because when you don't have
the desire of to make money on that day
that you're forced to make money because
you need to pay your bills and stuff
like that you won't eliminate your
creativeness do it you will eliminate
your creativity always think outside the
box and try to think okay what happens
if I put this piece and this piece
together that's the reason I track
statistics is because I can put two
statistical pattern together and to make
sure okay well those tell pattern can
combine together to get a better winning
percentage or better risk award so that

SOURCE VIDEO: 50% Fade Strategy! Most profitable trades in November [MePz7M6uRjA].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys D here welcome to this video
So today we're going to go over uh a
bunch of the hot plac that happened last
week as you can see that in the last two
months there is at least five plays in
know at least in one month and they're
providing decent amount of liquidity and
uh the flow is relatively low but
there's uh profitable opportunities
everywhere and let's go over some of
those tickers and uh before I start this
video make sure to click the like button
and subscribe let's get into it so the
first one uh we have is s this is a
BoTech uh as you guys know that biotechs
are typically very difficult to short
and with uh how much has gapped up
around 300% the overall pushing
percentage is about 100% on botch and as
I said that for pretty much all the
botch the pushing percentages are not
very stable they are not following the
average statistics compared to other
sectors that you're going to trade so
Healthcare stocks they are very special
and I would completely recommend avoid
botex tickers in the future doesn't
really matter is a gap upshore or multi-
Runners the only one that you
potentially can Ure is a fresh chart
with maybe a week or three months of
IPOs first time will be surrounding up
and hitting a dollar block maybe that
would be a a decent short but other than
that pretty much all of the biotechs
that has history uh trading in the last
couple years and uh with all of the
first scen day sometimes they do work uh
sometimes they do not the consistencies
are not there so if you make money today
you might lose it tomorrow on the btech
and uh that's not for the long-term
strategies so I would completely uh
avoid those stickers then we had sbfd
this one is a micro flat uh underneath 1
million float uh the Gap up percentages
is uh about 100% initially is at two
opened at four high of the pre market is
at five so I expect about 120% uh opened
a little bit less than 100% you can see
the potion percentages is almost another
50% so uh more than 50% almost gain
about 3.5 so almost 100% And for these
type of tickers average pushing
percentages they do not work on them and
if the ticker is really crowed you
always want to wait for consolidations
before you short uh into any type of
Spike and for these tickers the reason
why they're so difficult for beginners
is they always perform uh something like
this you do a fake out uh typically uh
it blows through your risk and for lower
floats it's very easy to get shaked out
because first of all their candles are
very aggressive and each candles can
sometimes perform 20% in one candle and
it gets halted and it's very difficult
to get out if you do not respect your
risk so that's the reason why a lot of
people tends to get uh shaked out in the
breakout over here and once the ticker
Consolidated for about an hour and if f
it all the way down typically uh ticker
fits about 50% from the day high because
it's a low flow once it hits the
neutralized area which typically is
around $2 but uh for a micro float and U
very crowded high density volume they
majority of the time only F 50% so your
typical risk uh reward uh risk will be
uh shorting the consolidation risking
the day high and the reward will be
around four the low 4ish so that's for
svfd uh do not recommend as a beginner
shorting into this type of under 2
million float uh very difficult to
control your risk so I would prefer much
smaller size now let's go over MLG now
this is the tricky one and a lot of
people got squeezed on the first Green
Day and let's take a look at the over
chart and uh give a I say a decent
analysis on this one so the first one we
had is uh a massive spike inight in that
intraday there's no consolidations
around you know into that Spike so you
can't really know where is the major
resistance then we had a slow grind up
to the 4.7 and 5.3 so pretty much all
the way to 5.3 the resistance is pretty
much cancelled so using the 5.3 as a
risk is not very ideal and a lot of
people are using a pre-market High and
the $5.3 area which is uh right here to
show into this consolidations and as I
said resistance is pretty pretty much
canceled so they're not reliable and get
squeezed all the way up to 15ish area so
once I would give this ticker maybe a
one try out if you really want to test
that 5.3 resistance but once the 5.6 is
broken that's where you have to exit
your positions and leave it for the rest
of the day because uh you can see the
ticker um went all the way up to 15 and
uh if you keep fighting with the tickers
and you will end up uh very similar
squeezes like TP and you can see that in
the next day it's not r at all because
first of all ticker like this typically
fad into the major support which is
around $6 area but this one broken into
support fad it all the way to $1 so if
you're all to this one it's a horrible
experience because you're going to lose
90% of your position uh to prevent
yourself um getting trapped into the
stickers there's a couple reference
tickers you can look at one is L andr
another one will be uh TP did a very
similar action as well and there's also
a GDC I believe all three three of those
stickers performed a very similar action
so uh what will happen going forward on
MLG this will probably Spike again into
the 5 to six doll area consolidate then
fade again so if you didn't catch MLG on
the short side or the long side uh there
will be a push soon because um typically
back ERS losing 90% uh what's the what's
the difference exiting at $1 compared to
exiting at zero so typically they are
more stubborn holding their positions
and stock will likely to bounce back and
they will sell um and that will be a
very decent o shorting opportunities in
the upcoming weeks and uh there's going
to be a lot more place that's coming in
in uh the end of this year so make sure
be careful and do not trade BX do not
trade low flow do not trade crowed
volume make sure spot the correct
resistance and that'll be end of this uh
recap videos uh if you have any
questions please leave a comment below
and other than that I will see you guys
in the next
one

every time when it happens there is
always a tier that is exceptional going
from 1 to 50 on the first few trades
let's say after 3 to 4 months you want
to make sure sizeing small or just
observe because you haven't placed a
trade in 3 to four months and you want
the opportunity to comes to you and you
know some of the people are eager to
place a trade you want to kind of get a
hint of the market how it's going and
make sure sizeing small or don't trade
it uh wait for the people not get
squeezed first because when people are
making a mistake and they're getting
squeezed by tickers like BMR or top like
last year and the mistakes that was made
the money will float to the lawns

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys Ste du here uh so in this
video I want to talk about some of the
criterias has been changed in the last
two years and they have been tracking
pretty much all the statistics
throughout 2022 and 2024 so I want to
talk about pretty much throughout 2021
after Co there's no uh money has been
printing now from the Federal Reserve
and I want to talk about how is the
market really reacting depending on the
overall Market going into 2022 as the
markets trending down we are not getting
tons of volume the average volume is
between 50 million to 100 million
there's no such thing that's been
trading over 100 million uh throughout
the year the frequency has been
happening really low then go into 2023
we definitely had a lot of Trades but
the market is Shifting back into normal
status the frequency of those trades has
been happening a lot uh going into 2023
we had bunch of Hypes HKD top ML and
some of the smaller trades are between
the flow is between 3 to 4 million
there's tons of opportunities for you to
catch I think my automated uh profit
sheets was generating over eight figures
in terms of profits going to 2022 I
think it's only around in the low seven
figures and going into 2024 I think the
market is going back all the way uh into
2020 and the average F has been trading
that's considered to be crowded is
anywhere between 150 million to 200
million so the volume and liquidity is
itself it's very efficient we are seeing
gme AMC trading 600 million volume 800
million volume but there's only one
thing has been changed compared to 2022
is all of the spikes does not last for
very long and every time when there is a
hype and the tier trading massive amount
of volume uh compared to 2020 very
similar to 2020 and either within a week
or within a month the company will issue
new shares and that would shares and the
ticker drops 50% 70% from the top so
compared to the yearly performance I
would say that you do not want to stay
in a specific ticker for very long the
spikes are very short period the time
then has been shortened pretty much 90%
as we seen that in AMC gme in 2020 they
can stay at a very high level MC was
trading around 60 for almost half a year
before it dropped this year it only
lasted uh a day so the spikes itself has
been shortened a lot the volume is still
there so you can still sizeing a lot of
shares and just by looking through
pretty much all the opportunity
throughout 2024 uh there's bunch of low
floats that's been happening and one
thing I want to talk about is the
neutralized area and the volume
specifically at the premarket there is
couple sections where we're looking at
in the premarket volume is if the volume
is Trading uh between I would say less
than 7 million over 4 million that's
where that you can use the volume
estimate to pretty much estimate the
entire day volume but if the volume goes
over then 7 to 10 million that's where
it becomes a little crowded but it's
still tradable then if the volume goes
over than 10 million and majority of the
time you are seeing over 20 million
volume in the Prem Market unless in
level it creates massive range it says
up 1,000% 2,000% if it's only up 200%
then it's not tradeable and if you're
shorting into those very Crow tickers it
may end very badly because whenever
you're are trading a very Crow tickers
and the spikes doesn't break through
your risk level in one go it go to your
risk level pulls back goes your risk
level again it makes you want to get out
sizeing in get out sizeing in again and
again and you keep taking paper cuts
throughout the day then that will become
massive loss interested in tring like

description below to get started now
let's dive back into the content
throughout this year I want to make sure
that whenever you see a very crowded
tickers in the Prem Market TR it's over
20 million you do want to avoid it
throughout the day and you can come back
in the next day to short because the
volume is not enough to support the
previous day volume to continue to go up
or it gaps down you can use over gap
down pattern that'll be much safer way
to take profits throughout the year and
there's another thing that I want to
mention is neutralized area which is
what is the lowest or Max reward the
terer can drop to especially when we're
trading 1 million floats 800k floats
600k float and all the way down to 200k
float in my personal opinion that I do
not want to touch the flow that is under
1 million and sometimes it's around 1.2
1.3 million float and you want to be
very careful especially going into
shoren into resistance because typically
we are using the ined volume compared
with the historical volume to judge how
much we want to size a into short into
resistance but with lower floats the
strength of the ticker especially that
trades decent amount of vol the pre
market becomes very unpredictable
especially when you are trying to shore
in the open with lower floats the
spiking percentages is much higher with
higher flow there's pretty much no
spiking percentages you want to track
that if if the flow is between 1 to 2
million 2 to 5 million 5 million plus 10
million plus 20 million plus to see that
if the ticker is likely to generate a
push or not because that will give you a
very good idea of where you want to take
your entry because that's very important
if you are missing the entry you pretty
much down 15 20% in terms of reward and
if you're not figuring out the
neutralized area which is the maximum
reward then you are going to likely to
miss pretty much 30 to 40% reward I
would High encourage you guys to track
the float based on the percentages level
and also the maximum reward how much you
can fade in terms of tracking down if
the ticker is a low float or anual float
or a high float that'll be uh My overall
experience throughout this year and uh
personally I want to avoid crowd tiers
and make sure that I want to avoid
something like mlgl as you guys
experienced overall in this month we had
a decent Gap up short that's not
following the regular pattern at all and
also we had a bound short going into
resistance not following the pattern at
all so you want to make sure not taking
huge losses on those stickers and make
sure that tracking on the float and the
maximum profit level will be very
helpful for you to generate and become
very consistent profitable all right
guys that'll be end of this video uh
thank you very much for watching I'll
see you guys in the next one

================================================

hello guys Steve next here welcome to
this video So today we're going to talk
about the monthly Recaps for pretty much
all the tickers that happened in the
last two weeks there were a bunch of
similar plays that we traded compared to
the place we had in June April and May
so there's a lot of similarities and
they can definitely find patterns to
trade for those stickers that especially
just announcer IPO before I start this
video make sure to click the like button
and subscribe let's get into it so the
first one we have is spgc this one was
the IPO and the chart itself looked
exactly like Lun R and GDC we
experienced in June and may we take a
look at it early UMR going from 136 and
dropped 80 after its run up and we're
looking at spgc dropped another 80
percent after its run up and pretty much
all of them perform the same pattern
after the drop the way to catch these
masks reward is you can use phone
comparisons so if yesterday's volume
traded it much higher compared to the
next day by using pre-market estimates
you can definitely take advantage of
that but only disadvantage that you will
have is your risk management so let's
take a look at spgc we can use overstein
gap down on this one it's one gap down
closed around 26 and it opened around 20
when to 21 and you only traded to 100K
volume at the very beginning so the
first few candles only traded about 100K
shares maximum Max size that you can
size in into these type of candles maybe
will be 10K or less must be less than
10K and your risk will be around either
the 30 area or yes it is close which
will be 26. so sizing in around 10K your
risk will be 50k then if you want to
risk 31 then your risk will be 100K and
especially by sizing in into those light
volumes those stickers tend to be very
dangerous if you a reverse so it's
really difficult to get a decent amount
of shares into the morning push in terms
of how much reward it will have it's
definitely significant but in terms of
how much you can size in it's you can
announce as even much shares so I
started in about maybe 3K in total I'll
write it all the way till four but other
than that I couldn't size even more and
if I really look into a size anymore on
to this type of IPO play you are looking
for the bounces that comes a few days
later so let's take a look at Lu Mr you
can see after it's massive Roundup you
will have this push either the day after
or a week later March 9th let's take a
look at that chart you can see it went
all the way up into the 19 dollar area
Consolidated and in the next day March
10th
it tests the 19 dollar and failed so you
form the double thing to the top so
shooting around 19 it's definitely
doable and the extension itself is not
that much but I showed it into these
stable place they do have sufficient
enough volume so you can definitely size
a 10K 20K no problem
then we go ahead look at GDC so it
pushed right about here on May 3rd and
pushed again around May 16th and the May
3rd area formed the resistance around 10
and this one touched around 10 area and
fitted all the way down so these traded
the 47 million bottom so in terms of how
much you can size in the ball and
Stephanie is sufficient the way to
become profitable on these type of IPO
play wait until the volume exhausts then
looking at the pre-market volume judge
how many shares you can size in
typically not that many nowhere in 10k
then you can keep the chart in your tab
or keep it in your scanner and wait
until about a week or two you can either
long it to get a decent bounce or if
you're not very good at long then you
can short it after the stockings massive
amount of volume then you can set in it
with pretty big size if they do give you
a decent enough extensions so that's for
the three tickers that we had throughout
this year and let's take a look at
today's or this week's place so first
one we have crkn this one was a gap up
short it didn't really Gap over 70
percent one thing I want to emphasize on
these type of tickers with Ahi and crkn
those stickers did not push 70 so it
does not fit the Gap up short criteria
these Temple players will train people
to shore into a very low percentage play
then they will get squeezed once a
ticker gains a decent volume and you
will straight go through the pre-market
resistance and there's really difficult
for them to get out as a consistent
profitable short Setters if you really
want to short it don't assassin you know
as a regular size maybe sizing ten
percent five percent if you really
borrow the tickers you can get your
borrow feedbacks but other than that the
market will train you to short those
tickers that not even over 50 then once
you got used to it they will reverse it
back and really punish you by shorting
it too early so that'll be all the recap
for this month the family questions
please leave a comment below and I will
see you guys in the next one

the older tuning Technic DVDs will be
20% off and our tier 1 3 2 and your
subscription will be 20% off as well I
only give a few discount per year so
grab my opportunities and I'm gonna do a
quick recap about the first civil mount
of overall trading performance it's
getting to it what so guys sleeping
experience so in this video we're gonna
talk about my overall performances this
year's starting from January 1st to July
so I'm gonna give the overall recap and
how the pattern really develops and some
patterns that change it a little bit
over like 2019 didn't really change that
much volunteer a little bit and a little
4runner changed a little bit so overall
I'm gonna go over some of the tickers
and let's get into it starting from
January 1st and to July 2nd I made
around nine hundred twenty nine thousand
I can see the all the trades has a
checkmark it means he's verified it's
verified from a third-party then I also
have my count statement posted on
Twitter you don't check my tutor or you
want to check the counseling that I
posted in twenty twenty eighteen as well
go ahead click the link now let's get
into the trade so majority of my trades
are made starting from January to March
because those three month hat I have the
biggest those three month then after
that April May June those are very very
boring I think there's some of the
tickers that happened that took pretty
much took everybody's money be PTH that
was one and nbod was one as well other
than that everything stays pretty normal
one of the things they really remember
that when there is no trade is something
like April May in June I placed about I
think less than ten trades per month
III was staying consistent I was staying
like 30 K 40k
50k per month on those three month Dale
had really big mouth sound like two
hundred thousand
didn't know if three hundred thousand in
January two hundred two hundred thousand
on February two hundred on March so
those month are ready to be pretty big
and
I have figured out for last past about
three years 2016-2017 to 18 and 19 most
of the stocks moves starting from
January to March then once we heading
into the summer season and the stock
really slows down once summer ends then
the season gets hot again before about
to get into trading then the next few
mouths is going to be great summer is
always sucks
there's no actions and especially
there's a bunch of holidays as well
people are heading to holidays there's
no more actions maturity of the trade
that I mentioned before mplt was one
that was a big trade and then we had
ppth young we had ft NW and I'm gonna go
over all those charts and give some
opinion about it
and how to really says in how to find
the edge now let's get into those two
tickers so MBO tbp th those are a
massive supernova if you want of a
supernova means they mean it's a huge
multi that runner went from I think $1
to $74 in couple of days
the mbit/s and has DB th but not as
extreme I went from I think from 2 to
almost $3.00 per share and those two are
same thing they're the killer of the
short sellers and they're also the
maximum word for short sellers so we are
shorting those type of a huge volume
don't ever try to sizing the front side
what do I mean by the front side front
side is somewhere stock is giving huge
amount of volume basically makes the
stock naturally both get super
correlated and nobody can really make
money it's become so unpredictable so
when you are seeing all those multi tier
owners always wait for the volume to
fade once the volume is fading then
that's where you can start to swim
because the stock is up so much that you
can get so much risk reward out of it
and it doesn't really matter if you got
in late and the nbod I think it won't is
one of the method I use in tasking or
DVD it's called maximum dollar buck or W
into the top P be th I didn't really
catch the top because
was very unpredictable and going
parabolic learning from basically $20 to
70 and I couldn't really find edge
you're really short into and the next
stage is cracked all the way to 19 same
things are lost it's too much of its own
gain and once it bounced I couldn't
really sass into it because I've already
dropped almost 80% from the top and
those two are the major play for the
Massimo TT runner one other thing you
have to be careful is once the stock
starting to lose over 50% of its own
again it's say the stock makes it goes
to 20 and pose to 10 already lost 50% of
the entire game in that time don't
really chase the shorts always setting
to a balance because once you sizing
after the start of the 50% you don't
have that much risk award-giving score
only comes in very very late because you
can only really set into a swimming
position instead of a day trading
position so don't short don't chasing
the stock if the Cyclops too much
especially over 50% and who are asking
how do I scan for the stocks very simple
I use platforms you can use all types of
platforms and there's trade ideas
there's stock trade then my skins
basically I use filters prices around 1
to 20 boeing has to be 100,000 in the
free market change means it needs to be
over 20% in the free market
yeah that's basically it and for PE
ratios are American for that the only
thing that's really important that is so
to be careful with the flow if the flow
is my control you have to always be
careful of shorting if it's a micro flow
and SS are also bigger for long because
it's really easy to manipulate and
people can really dump the shares and
there's possible include offering so all
tie risk is involved so just think about
it before you place the positions
overall I did pretty good in 2019 I had
a decent January in February March rest
of the month are pretty slow so really
hopefully you can get some actions after
August if you want to go check out my
trades
others

single trade is verified and all

stock went from 9 to 15 on really thin
volume this sticker looks very similar
to the ticker that happened recently
which is okyo another one but this is a
biotech sector biotech sector has
completely different fading percentages
only balance short can work on biotech
sectors typical fading percentage for
balance shorts 50 typical 13 percentage
for biotech sometimes can be as low as

hello guys team Ducks here welcome to
this video So today we're going to talk
about how to really trade the first
Green Day especially on the recent
runners
[Music]
I'm gonna cover the first Green Day on
biotech lkyl and hpx and some of the
patterns has performed exactly the same
especially for non-crowded Traders on
intraday on their first day on the round
other than that pretty much majority of
the first screen they are not tradable
so in this video I'm going to show you
some of the patterns that can be
recognized we also have a new course
that just came out I will link in the
bio and let's get into the video alright
so first one let's go over the most
recent one we had hpx this is an IPO
play we haven't had one of those tickers
for a very long time my first green day
typically what we're dealing with in the
last two months was pretty much all
biotechs right now we do have something
that's not biotechs and stock went from
9 to 15 on really thin volume so I was
tracking a couple levels on the stickers
there's one level starting from the
bottom around 9 to 50 this is
first thing I want to track is how much
did it pull from the first parabolic
typically if you pulled way too much
there's a high chance that the bat
holder wants to get out into the second
bounce this sticker looks very similar
to the ticker that happened recently
which is okyo another one but this is a
biotech sector one thing I want to
emphasize is biotech sector has
completely different I would say fading
percentages the data is completely
different only bound Shore can work on
biotech sectors sometimes even though
I'm sure don't even work that well
because of the weird statistics typical
fading percentage for balancer is 50
typical 13 percentage for uh for biotech
sometimes can be as low as 30 percent so
let's go to February 17th over here we
had another one of the parabolic spike
very similar as hpx trading much more
volume so I did up to more than 50 from
the top on the entire game range is
around 2.47 so in the middle this is the
50 mark I hear it's almost a 70 Mark and
once they faded that much typically the
chart can trap enough people who bought
around seven and under desperate to get
out into your bounce if you think about
the psychology of first green day
typically you don't really have any
resistance that's number one number two
you're pretty much traded based on chart
reactions and also on the level two and
based on different flow and market caps
the spiking percentage on the first
parabolic typically has all kinds of
variations for a billion dollar cap it
can only spec up to 30 for lower cap can
spec up to hundreds of percent and also
depends on the flow so typically for
beginners I do not recommend trying to
top tick on the first parabolic wait
until the stock pulls back and depends
on how far it pulls back you can kind of
make your plan while the stock is
spiking and calculate the pullback
percentages to make sure that your
shorting strategy have a good running
percentage this one came all the way
back testing the 6.1 so which is 15 of
the high when you're sizing around 15
you're taking I'll say a decent risk so
typically when you are shorting around
first during day your risk reward will
not be that great your risky War most of
the time is around one to one so in this
thing okay well typically first Green
Day do not fade all the way back down to
the neutralized area where it spiked so
90 of the time you earn 75 25 sorry
above the neutralized area so if you
look at the neutralized area which you
are starting to count in where the
bottom came in so three times 25 so
that's around four dollar area so the
stock should end around four by Port all
the way back to 3.2 the failing
percentage cannot be tracked into the
average 50 percentage for the first
Green Day same thing goes to hpx let's
do some math around here we had a star
expecting prices around nine into all
the way to 50. the first parabolic Spike
pulled back to 22 so the median range
around
9.94 to 36 so I'm using 36 minus 9
divided by two that's the 50 Mark you
landed right around 50 Mark respect the
game whenever you are looking at first
Green Day and the stock didn't hold only
post fifty percent so the bad holders
still have hope that the stock will
Spike and they're not likely to sell but
if if it pulls more and then 50 the
stock on the stock is likely to fail on
the bounce so this is one of the small
details uh on the statistics you should
track stock rebricks again to the 36 and
when you did it once you tell a fake
calories found there but hpx is a
different I would say it's considered to
be an IPO main name is because the
volume is way too low it only trade
around the 1.4 million shares throughout
the day so it's not a great as examples
to show
14 percentages will affect into the
second bounce but if you want to compare
okay well to rtda rkda into pretty much
the same thing very similar chart is to
impose more than 50 at the 65 percent
and this one failure all the way back
compared to pretty much the same as okay
like I'll fit it to the neutralized area
maximum fading point should be around
12. 20 to 25 above the neutralized area
so for okay by o should be 3.6 25 should
be four
rkda should be between 11 to 12 dollar
area especially on the selling pressure
on the first Green Day if it tends to
lose its momentum the stock is likely to
fade all the way back down uh I've been
changing the statistics about with that
one as I mentioned on the first screen
the shooting strategies your risk award
typically is not number eight risk
reward ratio is around one to one but if
you look around into the second green
second red day this one winter 34. do
already hit hit the bottom of the
consolidations hpx going all the way
back down to 14 and this if you look at
the uh the overall picture over a
picture for how much stock has scanned
and where is the 75 Mark for multi-tier
runners and this one faded you know only
about 75 markets around here around 22
went all the way down to 17 now the list
is 14 so it's you only landed about five
percent compared to the entire range
that was gained yesterday surely into
the following day on the red day it does
have much better reward compared to the
shorting to the first Green Day so those
are the main statistics that you want to
track for her screen day I do think is
really helpful try not to participate in
the first parabolic Spike always wait
onto the second pull to see how much you
actually pulled if it produces a bounce
after it pulled more than 50 percent
it's worth a try and a balance if it was
less than 50 don't even worry about it
so for politics specifically you have to
be more careful other than that that'll
be a first recap alright guys at the end
of this video thank you very much for

will have one of the sectors that's
going to be helped up in 2018 was about
the shipping companies 2020 was Co and
also biotechs as well because there is a

we have we have gme MC of the meme

Kind: captions
Language: en
so what do you think about our services
so what's a student that's here I'm here
with all my students from tears a
program and he's being our program for
three months and this is Tom hi guys my
name is Tom local restaurant owner here
and I've been in the restaurant business
for about 11 years and I just recently
started trading penny stocks so I want
you to choose any stats well being in my
business it's tough you know there's a
lot of you know stress it's a lot of
stress because human resource you know
people not showing up for work and food
cost is going up and it's it's tough to
be in this I wish you had to be there
all the time
yes that's full time yeah that'll be
there full time so I want to find
something that can make trading I think
for most of the jobs especially like
restaurant as the owner you have to deal
with a lot of stuff and you always have
to think you cannot focus on one thing
so you're always running and working and
I think restaurant and some resolve is a
summer job
eleven yeah our minds open like 11 Ian's
like 10 good so extended so that's about
10 hours everyday
plus the weekend so in trading sometimes
you don't need to look in the market for
the entire day sometimes you only need
to sit in front computer for maybe two
hours then you're off that they can do
think do you want I think that's one of
the benefits from trading in the market
so what do you think about our services
um I like it I like that chattering it's
a lot of fun you know I like that daily
ducks I think before a o'clock every day
were sometime around there a p.m. you
guys post a watch list every day it's
really helpful it helps me recap what
happened that day in what you look for
yeah
so typically in our daily ducks we lay
out our plans to trade before the trade
happens we also do watches today before
and sometimes a place happens in the
morning so we'll have to be in the chat
room and giving real-time thought
process because both up to play comes
from yesterday only a small amount of
new place comes in the morning do you
have any suggestions for our camera I
like to see that traveling with new
features maybe like a bulletin board
because uh I see a lot of new members
coming in and they all ask the same
question like which broker to you you
know like when I mean say something
sometimes it gets bumped up so much and
we can't see it we have to school up so
something in the nature where you know
there's you can only show like
Chad's Nikolas that's that's all I pay
attention to mm-hmm
sometimes the member chat is fun too but
I would like you know stick to more of
that I mean alerts yeah because I think
he needs to be more focused sometimes
they get off the start set talk about
something else so I'll probably add a
bulletin board on the left or on the
right and basically shows and messages
and also shows the basic questions that
what broke I use what's the instruction
how to use our database our monthly
report all that good stuff so what do
you think about our webinars oh I like
the webinars so usually like the
webinars I make I make like sometimes
twenty to thirty percent on webinars
just because I see you live trade and
then I know what you're doing and then I
follow it and usually when there's a
good pattern and when you get in stock I
will get in you know in big position too
and it's very profitable sometimes you
go in with a rep pattern because people
used to know what good pattern it is
what happens to trade but if you don't
know what you're trading when you're
going with somebody else that either
they don't know what they're doing or it
don't have a good enough track record
then it will be very very difficult to
make money because some of people in
this industry they divide with the
subscribers in this cell into the
subscribers so in the end people who
bother make money but subscribers or
people or students of theirs cannot make
a profit from so how much have you made
for the past three month
well my account is really small
I did this to like a test I pull like a
6 km and last month I made like 8.5 umm
in next month I think I'm I'm gonna get
in like for like the 50k where are Japan
so that's we you know be more careful in
trees and not you get in on our stock
stock doesn't have pattern so I'll be
more careful when I actually you know
start trading trading yourself testing
the market I think in trading as
especially in the beginning if you make
profits I mean you have to practice for
iovis a couple month and I think that's
good enough and you know what all the
good pattern is once you pull a decent
amount of money into the market now the
safe way I do it or the simple idea is
if you made 100 percent is safe another
fifty thousand found a little in our
investment
you just pull out the fifty thousand
just in case then you can start
generating more because you don't have
that stress if you don't have that
pressure because once you take a decent
loss you don't feel that much because
it's on my project and I think that's a
one of a good way to reduce your stress
from market yeah when when we have our
web nerves and so on Sunday and Thursday
usually that Thursday ones I do really
well because I don't have that stress
because um when I see what you're doing
I feel like I know I'm three and then
I'm like say one day I will make you
know was six thousand dollars I will
make like go maybe the mess per day was
like 2700 mm-hmm you know I can't see
myself with 50k account I can't make at
least 10k a day yeah sometimes yeah 15k
yeah so um it's it seems like the easier
trace the pattern trade that trace out
has a really good pattern mm-hmm
it's really easy it's really easy yeah
and then the harder and then that once
that doesn't really have really good
pattern mm-hmm it's really hard it's the
address
it doesn't wanna you know go the way you
want were it you had to wait a while
yeah I've been there yeah right so yeah
I like easy trace I'm gonna you know try
to stay away from once that doesn't have
pattern get in heavy on the ones that
does you know I think that's the hardest
part about trading is not over trade
yeah that's that's probably the part I'm
still struggling on as well I'm not such
a girl so much I used to do that and
once I started an earning earning in the
process I select out all of the patterns
I don't need to try to stack up the
patterns that need to trade to be able
to make at least generating 70 to 80
percent winning percentage and sometimes
I do makes more mistakes but for now I
think personally I'm doing pretty good
just by focusing on the patterns and how
to you set in the incessant now so I
think people are struggling the market
try to study your winner losses and why
did you lost why did you wear and what
kind of stripes are behind it so choose
all the winning strategies and only
trade those patterns then you can be
sufficient in the market so we have
provided two extra services one is
monthly report one is strategic database
for penny stocks and I don't see any
people are doing it so what do you think
I'll earn your services yeah I like the
monthly reports well just tons of
information I can go back on and we view
it and then you know get more from your
with that patterns and the claps it's
helpful you know the more I see the more
premier like you and I can use it for
later trade and spa you know spot spot
good entries with it no yeah the
percentages is there I mean yeah we see
it you know everybody see it so it's
very helpful yeah I think there's one
factor that helps you get a lot is I
think we attach the market because the
matsuri poorest occur in monthly report
so basically helps you adapting the
previous month and we found out there's
a gap how short that typically pushes 20
to 25 percent in the morning then we use
that to pick our increase then that it's
a very very good
I'll have done it several times and we
basically top take the stock and made
extra ten to twenty percent unusual and
I think that is the way to improve your
trading performance just by tracking all
those data's trying to adapt to the
market and try to you think and other
strategies can improve your previous one
so uh where do you see yourself in
training next two or three years well
I'm hoping I sell that Wescott and you
know just go travel and then go on
vacations and trade only like ninety 11
a.m. on different places you know in the
world yeah that's my ultimate goal I
guess to travel yeah I just travel
around and then get up in the morning
trade and go play that the time I think
the time difference will be very
difficult because there's different time
zones you have to get up very very
sometimes you have to wake up in there
and especially Hawaii yeah I guess I
mean it's you know it's couple hours
maybe four hour yeah it shouldn't be
that longing for you I think when you're
traveling you make better decisions
because you don't want to spend that
much time and you want to make
time as much as sufficient as possible
so you only can really see the good
place because of when I'm traveling I
make much more profit when I'm sitting
at home I'm beginning bored and looking
the computer today and start all over
chatting so um I have a question um I've
been talking with other members um some
of them making like you know anywhere
from 10 K to even 300 K mm-hmm we how do
you feel when your students are making
so much you know like 300 K within like
three months do you know do you feel
very satisfied do you feel like
something you got complex on thing
really good oh yeah I do really feel
satisfied because it really proves that
my strategy works and it has better
performance because that's been so much
work a Q many other strategies and try
to get the best reg out there and to
really help people how to really
properly in front and start correctly
instead of following other people and
not the self sufficient and this will be
a really good long run for people that
wants to stay in this game but for
people that just want to follow our
alerts just want to make money in from
words I think this is it doesn't satisfy
me will you make money but when you can
be self-sufficient and make money on
your own
based on my strategy I can also improve
of my strategies that's where I feel
that I really feel I accomplished
something that's it for today some
people are looking forward for me to do
an interview with my students so here it
is and thank you very much done and

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys demdux here welcome to this
youtube videos and
i know i haven't done a video for a
while i've been traveling for a lot so
we're getting ready to launch our new
platform
which will be called starcraft so in
this platform
uh one of the special thing that we have
is we can run a simulation based on
your own strategies so if you want to
find or you want to
create your own strategies you can
actually go in for the last 15 years
to test it out in either nasdaq or new
york exchange
to see if your strategy actually works
or not so
in that way it's much better to find an
edge than tracking in real time going
forward
this platform will be great for beginner
traders if you are interested please
click the link below uh in the videos
and register your email
so as soon as it's launched i will let
you guys know
so today's video we'll be uh going over
some of the recaps
on the ticker that happened this week
specifically since the last two weeks we
haven't had that much going on
all we had is amc going back and forth
between 50 to 60
and gme going between 200 to 230.
since those two tickers have calmed down
in terms of how much bonds been trading
every single day
and now we're heading into the normal
market that everybody's trading
around under 10 stocks now so today i'm
going to go over some of the long
strategies and short strategies
based on the observation that i had for
the last two weeks and also to see if
the actual data changed
uh compared to the last six months so uh
we have three tickers today uh i wanna
go over amc
you can see that the ticker has been
consolidating between 50 to
60 for a very long time and
we're already heading into june actually
july
so the earning actually comes out around
august
5th for the sticker it's not going to be
correlating the same level as the
current price
so likely this is going to drop but
overall in terms of volatility in terms
of risk award
it's not really worth it to trade amc
because
it's trading really low volume now and
also uh
there's actually not much range to
profit from because
it's either going from 61 to 58 or
58 to 55 55 to 60 so it's moving around
one to two percent per day so not really
worth it to trade
uh i will have to leave amc and gme
along
so once they completely lose the
qualities and they drop where they
belong
then the volume will start heading into
other tickers
c-uen and mri and those are the two
major runners and that happened this
week mrin
actually ran up to almost 20 per share
based on this five dollar breakout so
you can see that
the stock had around the 170 million
support around
six dollar-ish if you take a look at in
15-day and two-minute chart
the stock actually consolidated right
above
the support which is around six to five
sixty
and consolidated a little bit above that
so 650
and it got a lot of volume
i'll gapped up in the next day up to
the 10 11-ish so this is where it comes
to
the tricky part whenever you are trying
to go long or short you have to actually
go in
and see okay what is the buyer's
mentality today what is the short
seller's mentality today
so let's look at the chart whenever you
see that something that goes
over 100 percent in your current day
trading mass amount of volume
the buyers definitely going to be a
little bit nervous
and they feel like they missed out the
major round up so they would like to
buy a little bit above the
consolidations so which is
around seven dollar and buying around
eight dollar risk in one dollar which is
not that bad
so going along on multi-day runners it's
actually caused the major squeeze on
tuesday went from eight to almost 20
and traded around 300 million shares so
when i traded around three to four
hundred million shares normally there is
not going to be higher volume coming
into the next day because we're already
hitting the maximum volume
uh that's in average trading in the
entire penny stock market
so in this way i gapped down about 20
percent
uh traded about 2 million volume in the
pre-market so you know it's not going to
trade 300 million shares
throughout the entire day what we know
is that as long as the stock on current
day doesn't trade as much
volume compared to yesterday the stock
is unlikely to go
up or unlikely to continue trending up
on that day so you can see that stock
actually went from
14 to 10 dollars per share but overall
this sticker is not very tradable
because mrin
gapped down about 20 percent we all know
that
maximum draw down percentage on a ticker
especially on intraday level is around
26 percent
so it's already down 21 you only have
five percent in average to profit from
i understand that ticker is very
overextended and also you are
trying to short into a support from
yesterday which is at
12 to 13 area so it's not very ideal
shooting at the open but mrn definitely
good luck
opportunities personally i missed it but
i will be
looking for this type of opportunity in
the future it's a very classic multi-day
runners and ran
for about three days and uh now it's
pretty much dead and likely to continue
to fade back to
around in about two weeks
so now taker will be cuen this is a
classic gap up short
while we know that based on my personal
experience of tracking those type of
gappers
if they don't push over 20
trading with massive amount of volume
the chart typically gets really strange
throughout the day so you can see there
is a morning stuff
it broke down it was a fake out then
came back up testing the nine dollar
area rejected
then pushed up trying to break out again
rejected again typically when gapper
pushes anywhere between 25 to 30 percent
and they do these type of stuff in
candles the entire chart
is likely to turn into a all-day fader
but for cen specifically
it didn't and that's why you are seeing
this strange actions and people chasing
two weaknesses and now it's reversing
from the down trending momentum
so for future gappers especially
training with
mass amount of volume and it's also
considered to be a low flow
uh if the stock didn't really push i
would say 20 to 30 percent in the
morning
i would not recommend shorting it if
it's trading over
100 million shares uh before 10 30.
so that will be all my thoughts on c uen
and
mrin not very ideal takers
mrn is a great long but it's not a
really great short
mc still laying in the same area so
make sure to stay safe out there and
keep tracking your statistics
and make sure that you do not fall into
these type of traps
there's tons of long traps and short
traps everywhere the market just
starting to come back after the massive
run on amc
so stay safe out there and i will see
you guys in the next video

SOURCE VIDEO: Are you serious about building a small account？ [WtiweifTq9c].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
I haven't getting a lot of questions
that people asking how do you really
grow a small count and yeah I have came
there from before I started a little bit
higher but people want to ask me well
why if I have only three thousand five
thousand dollars I'm under PD Qi and I
can't really treat that much so what do
I do after that
so there's a few ways that I came up
with so first you to choose the right
broker there is Interactive Brokers I
started back in 2016 and you can start
with trade zero you can start with short
trader I think they'd accept account
under 25,000 so short traders and trades
over there both have really good shorts
availability and if you're over thirty
thousand dollar account you can choose
either Cobra trading center point speed
trader and whatever brokers you think is
the best for you so internet brokers
that have really really cheap
commissions so you can use it for deep
I'm buying multi-day breakouts and I
think it's the best suit for going long
on stock now for sure availabilities
I'll say sure trader speed traders
Richard Perle Centerpoint or trade zero
so whichever you think is the best
choose that one let's talk about counts
that it's around 3,000 to 5,000 now for
the best recommendations I will
recommend in terms of brokers so you
don't want to figure out how to sure yet
because you don't have that much
opportunities to waste and you can't
really have you can't really afford that
much mistakes at the beginning so you
first you need to find a really really
consistent patterns I'm talking about
even though they don't happen often you
don't want to go in full-time with 3,000
to 5,000 are ok I'm going to find a
really consistent pattern that we have a
consistent return but it doesn't really
happen that often what I've seen is one
of the best ripple pattern is define a
pretty I would say between large be car
to mid large me cap
when they have a massive draw down with
a moti that's a multi-day breakout and
it's a multi-day runner so let's say the
market cap is around I'll say one
billion to two billion when they pull
back about 20-30 percent it's going to
bounce it's going to bounce at least 30
to 25 percent now that's a pattern it
gives you really really consistent
return by really doesn't it doesn't
really happen that often I have tracked
about a year to happen about well I
would say 1020 times for a year but they
all have really really good consistent
return so you can basically make about
twenty to thirty percent in one go
and with a small count not a pitbull
wants to rush in and make a lot of money
you can't do that you have to slow
boomer count into the most comfortable
zone which is around thirty thousand to
a hundred thousand if you are into that
area it's really easy to make I would
say $500 a day $1000 maybe ten thousand
sometimes even twenty thousand dollars
per day but with a small count
you need to be patient and you don't
want to go in full time at the beginning
find a really consistent return pattern
and make sure you get that twenty to
thirty percent for those twenty
opportunities per year not for last
there's really really important thing
Ellen emphasized is your risk management
now I went through the five thousand
dollar risk management so let me give
you a really specific recommendations
that I came out with so first if you
have a five thousand dollar account the
total position should be around I would
say 700 ish and your risk will be around
$50 to $70 per trade and you're looking
forward to make a hundred two hundred
fifty dollars per trade now it seems
really small at the beginning but once
you start rolling and can snowball that
each time your percentage of your
account you pull out your risk per trade
for increase and also increase your
profit as well and since you have
already
in return and consistent pattern it will
be slow but you can grow your account
really really steady and once we get
into that thirty thousand and you're
over PDT your profit curve will increase
significantly
so to quarrel smile count don't be a
rush because you're under PDT and you
see a lot of people making money you
have to focus on yourself focus how to
improve yourself how to improve your
mistakes because in the bay people who
are making money who are losing money it
is you is not other people you can never
run somebody else and can these
implementations but always trust your
own judgment and always always be
patient don't get emotional at the
beginning you don't have risk too much
just find that one pattern that works be
patient wait for it and get the
execution better and better now
once you grow into the comfort zone and
start learning into other strategies and
you always have this consistent return
pattern to back you up with the mistakes
that you will discover or try out on the
new patterns so love you all and thank
you very much and I will see you guys

so if you take a look at the entire run
it's been running for almost two months
starting at $10 you can see there's a
massive support in the 30s because it
started to break out at 30 and start to
go parabolic after 30 and we're running
into going to the next week of the final
election week I was thinking that maybe
if the support is around 30 and 35ish
potentially in covering around 35 will
be ideal and they didn't really sure
going to the next 2 days because I think
we're way close to the support and the
actually depth under it I think I was
long very little into the 35ish lost a
little bit but not too crazy

first of all ticker like this typically
Fades into the major support which is
around $6 area but this one broken into
support faded all the way to $1 so if
you're all to this one it's a horrible
experience and because you're going to
lose 90% of your position uh to prevent
yourself um getting trapped into the
tickers there's a couple reference
tickers you can look at one is L andr
another one will be uh TP did a very
similar action as well and there's also
a GDC believe uh all three three of
those stickers performed a very similar
action so uh what will happen going
forward on mlgo this will probably Spike
again into the 5 to $6 area

and we'll see how the market performs
and also if the rates are dropping down
the money will be flowing back into the
market we should experiencing more
liquidities that's being injected into
the market for a summary of 2023 first
of all do not size in very aggressively
make sure pay attention to the volume
pay attention to the float and also do
not try to deal with biotechs even
though they have tons of warrants if
their floats are between 700k to 3
million once they decide not to execute
their warrants on that on that specific
day they want to execute on the second
day then you will run into a ticker that
squeezes 500% from open likea so one of
those tickers will out your entire year
play those stickers are not worth it

Language: en
so the first one uh we have is SE this
is a biotech uh as you guys know that
biotechs are typically very difficult to
short and with uh how much has gapped up
around 300% the overall pushing
percentage is about 100% on BoTech and
as I said that for pretty much all the
biotechs the pushing percentages are not
very stable they're not following the
average statistics compared to other
sectors that you're going to trade so
Healthcare stocks they are very special
and I would completely recommend avoid
botex tickers in the future

SOURCE VIDEO: Avoid Chinese Stock Blowups! #shorts #investing [MU7NUsrAzGA].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let's talk about some of my perspective
throughout different sectors so the
first one will be the Chinese hypop
sector typically what I heard from The
Brokerage owners most of it the biggest
blow up happens uh when people are
trading llow Chinese htop play something
like HKD and top then the second thing
that I heard will be biotex so you can
see DG going from $2 to 50 and it's been
really stubborn from its breakdown so I
typically see people swing going big
swing shore on those consolidation plays
after it's hyped up on botex which I
don't see a very good consistent
profitable strategy playing these
consolidations or dollar block multi-
runers and biotics

if you're a beginner or if you are
trading maybe in your first two to three
years I would highly just suggest to
avoid those tickers because generally uh
you're likely to going to take a loss on

expensive so there a news news
situations so and that's something that
I want to suggest

SOURCE VIDEO: Avoid Costly Pump & Dump Traps! #shorts #stocks [fEv-OIEIlmg].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
T so this one looks like a pump and dump
chart and uh it went from basically 13
14 into 100 almost
$193 if you go into the in chart it had
a massive gap down they had its push
into the 75ish so I took a decent Shore
into I think it's the once the breakdown
happened I think it's in the 68 69 is
didn't write it because wasn't very
comfortable the only traded about 1 mil
shares throughout the day and the
minimum requirement for daily volume
needs to be 4 million so you needs to
trade the same amount of shares as the
previous day and also the amount of
dollar traded is not sufficient as well

SOURCE VIDEO: Avoid Emotional Trading Mistakes! 🎯 #shorts #trading [okzrBnlU-Ac].en.vtt

Language: en
When you then hit those losses, what was
your mindset like then?
&gt;&gt; It's not about the losses or about the
money. It's more about what I was
thinking because I'm not supposed to
take this type of loss. It's
&gt;&gt; outside your plan.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, outside of my plan. And it's
really a amateur movie. It's more like
you're buying zero day expiration call
options. It's very gambly. So, every
month I tend to go back and look at my
trades. Is this loss actually necessary
for me to take? Am I learning from this
loss? Is it actually following the
statistics? You have to be really
disciplined because some losses there's
exceptions that ticker that doesn't
really follow the pattern. So those
losses are necessary. I'm okay with
that. But for losses that's made by pure
emotional mistakes, that's not
acceptable for me.

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
FF iie we did a reverse split and tend
to round again it faded too much on the
second Green Day so that's why I had to
bounce after first red day so there one
thing that you have to pay attention to
is whenever you are shorting or using a
first red day pattern if the first red
day drops too much let's say exceeding
50% of the total round range then going
into the following day you will have to
be a little bit careful going into this
day you can see after about 11:30 went
all the way back to 8 which didn't trade
that much volume and going to the next
day it bounced then it slowly faded so
should I build a swing positions into
this but the volume is really low
trading only 3 to four mini shares a day
so you could get easily squeezed up to 8
n 10ish that's why I didn't build a
swing position into this not very ideal


================================================
SOURCE VIDEO: Avoid High Volatility Traps! #shorts #stocks [yhLNoxznzzg].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions

it's very difficult to control your risk
on very high volatility and also
nanoflow limit down your size uh your
size will affect the price on the spread
so if you're covering you're in a panic
covering the market orders you will get
a really bad executions majority of the
low flow on SSR it also will be on recu
which means you can only use up your
shares once and you have to borrow your
share the second time which will be more
expensive so it comes down hard to
manage your risk then fees up on fees up
on fees if you hold overnight

Language: en
and if the ticker is really crowed you
always want to wait for consolidations
before you sh uh into any type of Spike
and for lower floats it's very easy to
get shaked out because first of all
their candles are very aggressive and
each candles can sometimes perform 20%
in one candle and it gets halted and
it's very difficult to get out if you do
not respect your risks but uh for a
micro float and U very crowded high
density volume they majority of the time
only F 50% as for svfd uh do not
recommend as a beginner shorting into
this type of under 2 million float uh
very difficult to control your risk so I
would prefer much smaller size

whenever we are shorting into a massive

trade sufficient enough volume that's
number one number two it needs to gain
enough percentages above the initial um
support level if you are lacking either
of those criterias then the pattern is
not likely to work and it's very liquid
so it's very easy to get stuck into it
if you decide to place a swing short
into these type of low liquidity tickers

whenever you see a very boring season

to make profit and that's where hype
comes in the perfect wave that every
short aggressive short Setters are
shoren the two already causing the stock
or go from one to 50 you know one to 100

50% of its gain so it had a small push
uh I did a small size into here for this
typ of play you should swing for a few
days to get the best reward you can see
in a few days you fit it to $1 but the
reason why I don't like it and I didn't
push in the size because it's under $3

it's on you know 70 cents stock so

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys D so this video is going to
be a little bit different it's not about
Recaps it's about how to really manage
your risk in the most efficient way
after pretty much finishing the whole
year of trading we have two months left
according to my observations throughout
this year and the opportunity has
significantly dropped compared to 2020
and 2021 and there is some adjustments
for how to really manage your risk so uh
let's talk about the most hpe of Seasons
throughout this year year which I
believe is February May June and October
you can see different seasons performs a
little bit different some of it has
really high liquidity some of it has
really low float and very extremely
difficult to trade especially on the
fees borrowing low flow cost 50 cents
per share overnight cost about $2 per
share those fees can pretty much eat
your Al when when you are a short seller
and going along on these especially the
volatility on recent Chinese play they
can drop from $30 to 50 in one day so
pay attention to the offerings and
potential warrants also you have to be
really careful as well let's talk about
the few mistakes that I made throughout
this year I think it should be very
helpful for the beginners and especially
how to prevent blowing up through you
know shorting maybe BMR shorting DG
let's talk about some of my perspective
throughout different sectors so the
first one will be the Chinese hypop
sector typically what I heard from on
The Brokerage owners most of it the
biggest blow up happens uh when people
are trading llow Chinese htop play
something like HKD and top then the
second thing that I heard will be botex
so you can see DG going from $2 to 50
and it's been really stubborn from its
breakdown so I typically see people
swing going big swing short on those
consolidation plays after it's hyped up
on botex which I don't see a very good
consistent profitable strategy playing
these consolidations or dollar block
multi- owners and biotechs they usually
don't work that really well and I
personally took few losses on drop I did
not get squeezed from 2 to 50 but I took
multiple losses on the consolidations
even though it fits the multi- runner uh
criteria and it does those big up and
swinging and going up and down very
difficult controler risk and of course
it's being a really challenging period
for Traders because the opportunity has
been dropping from my observations
there's only about two to three plays I
say in average per month sometimes even
one on both side long opportunities and
shorting opportunities there is maybe
about three seasons that 3 months we
have about in averaging seven to eight
plays so this is more about patience of
Traders because every time we run into a
slower seasons and everybody be become

to get started now let's dive back into
the content most of the people and I can
see that they are sticking to one
pattern and they took one big loss and
wiped out the entire game in the last 3
months and I would recommend setting up
run rules for especially beginner
Traders even though for me I set up
three time rues so basically if you are
taking one losses and second losses on
the same ticker in one day then you can
tell your brokage every time you take
two consecutive losses on in one ticker
especially on the first screen day it
stops you from Trading completely in
that day then maybe come back on the on
the second day now on the third time you
take a loss again on the same ticker I
would stay away completely from the
sticker and not trading it anymore
because and it prevents you from you
know fighting into the stickers and
trying to make your money back you can
definitely catch opportunities there's
always opportunities coming in have a
good rule to go against your
stubbornness is always very efficient
also very important to stay uh
consistent profitable and another thing
is on the sector wise I would highly
recommend avoiding Chinese HP toop first
screen day tickers and also biotex as
well and on the other side there will be
psychology countering on the nanoflow
side so I can kind of see that a lot of
people don't really trade 500k flow 700k
FL because whenever a ticker trades 20
minute shares as a 500K flow if there's
nobody trading that 500k flow the stock
goes instantly down 30% 40% and a lot of
people see it as a good reward and next
time when they see a 500K 600k float
they jump pain and of course as I
mentioned in this video many times it's
very difficult to control your risk on
very high volatility and also nof flow
limit down your size uh your size will
affect the price on the spread so if
you're covering you're in a panic
covering the market orders you will get
a really bad executions majority of the
low flow on SSR it also will be on Reco
which means you can only use up your
shares once and you have to borrow your
share the second time which will be more
expensive so it comes down hard to
manage your risk then fees up fees up
fees if you hold overnight those three
things which I personally run into is
the hardest to trade even though on the
gap down days is when it pushes and
consolidates my experience trading
throughout this year is being really
really patient and only focus on maybe
one to three trades and uh when it's a
hyp up Seasons make sure that you avoid
first Green Day Crow tiers three sectors
Chinese plays biotechs and Nano floats
so which is under uh 1 milon the rule
that I mentioned two years ago that you
don't want to exceed over 10% the entire
flow size it's been changing a little
bit because you can kind of see that the
borrowing industry has been changing in
the last 3 years the borrows become
cheaper and overnight rates still remain
the same when borrow becomes so cheap
let's say a 750k flow only have maybe 2
cents or 4 cents it cost you like $ few
hundred to borrow throughout the entire
day and very expensive holding overnight
you can kind of go into the short setts
mentality so they only want to trade on
intraday and they do not want to hold
overnight and the covering majority of
the strength comes in afternoon because
they cover their shares they do not want
overnight and going to the next day with
a huge gap down because there's no
shorts in there anymore you have to kind
of measuring that is it really worth it
to hold overnight because there's nobody
holding short overnight and typically
when there's nobody's shorting stock
drops the most in this year specifically
it's becoming more competitive for short
sets be really patient is number one
thing number two thing is always try to
reverse psychology ology of the short
Sellers and the buyers it should give
you tons of advantage in terms of sizing
n into strengths carbing into weaknesses
all right guys that'll be all my
thoughts throughout this year make sure
that uh your risk management stay in
place thank you very much for watching
I'll see you guys in the next one

so those are the four tiers that I
traded through this month billion dollar
market cap I seem like the dollar block
is around 1.7 to2 billion I still need
more samples to test it out going to
multi Runners on GDC seems very
manipulated not a natural developed
chart if it's a natural develop chart
you should lost this momentum on this
day on August 22nd for f f dropped too
much on the first red day so it didn't
give us much reward on second red day
mrm is a healthcare but it's actually
not a healthare there so those are the
four tickers through this month not very
IDE deal but small profits is okay to be
made that should be it for the recap for
this month

anywhere between 60 to 70 as you can see
here's a double top right here and the
for split do does not cancel the
resistance so you can see that on May
14th you H 70 instant crash all the way
down to 60 that's where I was confirmed
that the resistance is around 70 and
that's where I picked the AMC short
right about on the breakdown so the
average is around the 950 I cover in the
five and 6ish for gme it had a crash uh
in the midday but I saw that there is a
bunch of support that was formed the day
before so which is on May 13 so there is
a massive consolidations before the
breakout around 30 so I knew that the
neutralized area will be stating around
30 as you can see that the chart fade
all the way back down to 36 and formed
the massive support that's where I
covered my positions around 30 I think
it was around 36 is I resorted it around
45 covering the pullback and I did not
touch it for the rest of the day

and this is the chart that the forest
split has already priced in uh I do
remember back in the days that a gme
resistance uh was at 400 300 to 400 and
after forward split the gme high spun
was at 120 so major resistance it landed
anywhere between 60 to 70 as you can see
here's a double top right here and the
for split du does not cancel the
resistance so you can see that on May
14th you H 70 instant crash all way down

so the first one we want to talk about
will be Dru this is the one that bought
pretty much all the volume out the
initial Spike starting it at $2 went all
the way to 50 first screen day of course
I did not touch it I touched it and the
second day when it tested the 26 area I
was not expecting this one goes all the
way to the 36 and potentially causing a
big breakout on this specific day I
think I lost a little bit because I was
in down on the breakout I shortly in the
26 to 30ish turns out did not work out
very well it was also low float and that
did not hold overnight because the
overnight rates was extremely expensive
I think was 500% throughout the year so
it about $1 per share overnight

in terms of shorting strategies I do not
recommend it short if the stock has wors
and you're shorting after open because
if you're looking that in the long-term
consistencies it's not going to perform
that well and if you make money let's
say the tickers has a low float and you
short it at the open it has a bunch of
wors ready to go and you fade it let's
say all the way down to where it begin
to spike yesterday then uh you will make
40% 50% re again and next time if they
choose not to execute their warrant and
short after open instantly 30 40%
pushing percentages after open then you
will be down massively without having uh
a potential exit because the stock is
Haled all the time so that's are not a
very consistent strategies so in terms
of going into long terms I do recommend
avoid all of the biotechs only focus on
Technologies don't trade energies as
well uh so botch and energies those are
I will say the two sectors you do not
want to touch any other sectors are okay
to trade with

We also had a BULL another IPL 1 to70
and we tested multiple times as
overstaying gap down. So here is one
thing uh whenever you are trying to
short overstay gap down and very
important that if the ticker only tends
to run as one green day not a second one
the ticker becomes very stubborn in
terms of it will produce multiple
bounces if it performs overstaining gap
down. The ticker has to run at least 2
days up over 500% for it to qualify as a
multi-day runner. Of course, made a
mistake again. I shorted it into the
push around 50. I think it was 54 55.
Got stopped out and then reshorted it
again once was a big rejection. I took
very smaller cuts on BL. So overall,
it's not very ideal, but I can see that
the mistake is definitely avoidable. And
of course going to the second day,
testing 52.

so if the chart was affected by offering
and it was dropped by offering this is
not a natural developed chart and that's
where I did not size into the 48 because
I knew that there is a massive support
around 30 to 40 and sizing up at 48
isn't a very good place to get enough
reward so that's why I just not for
forgot about it and do not trade it for
the rest of the day

start with May 14th this is where I made
the trade so we had two- day round of
AMC this is the sympathy play of gme
because we have those hype of gme after
ring Kitty posted uh his positions on
gme so that bring the volume into MC as
well overall there's one thing that I
didn't pay attention to is the forward
split on gme the reason why I mention
about Forest split is I'm not really
sure that for split will cancel the
resistance I'm 100% sure that uh reverse
split will cancel the resistance
typically when reverse split happens it
will completely refresh the chart and
all the resistance will be cancelled
then if the bound comes in today then
will be a fresh chart there is no
resistance or no resistance to risk off
and it will not be a bounce short that's
where I see a lot of people making
mistakes that trading a reverse split as
a b short

VSS was also a trade here line it's very
easy to get stopped out on this because
he traded I believe was 25 million
volume in the pre-market and they had
pretty much 300% spiking percentage
after market open busted through this
pre-market high and it's very easy to
show against the pre market resistance
and get stopped down when they had a
massive parabolic and of course it faded
all the way down and if you don't
partial size and your P size into
against spr Market High and and then I
would imagine this would be a relatively
big loss so going forward if you see
that pre-market Vol is extremely crowded
over 20 million I'll always always
recommend that you want to wait until at
least 10:00 before it size in and also
pay attention to the single candle
volume

on the second greenness then you tested
the premarket High it actually
Consolidated and held it skin through
end of the day whenever you want to use
the pre-market pullback and risking the
premarket High first of all the
pre-market needs to trade solid amount
of shares which he did the test into the
pre-market resistance was solid as well
you had the pull back as soon as it
tends to recover uh you will have to
exit it's not really wise to hold
overnight can see you went all the way
to 12 going to the next day had about
50% pullback which is not really

so for this one uh it did a massive
consolidations in August 8th so the
total dollar was traded is roughly
around 1.7 billion and we had a big red
day on the following day so let's go to
August 7th they had a massive
consolidations in the 6.7 in traded
about 250 million volume I trade about
26 million volume times 6.5 that's
around 1.7 to calculate the premarket
Market it traded about I think around 16
million shares or 20 million shares in
the pre market so the volum is not
likely to exceed the previous day volume
that's why I had a massive red day the
only reason I didn't go really
aggressive on into this is there is only
two day round so one from 2 to 8 and
typically we want multi divers to around
3 days in a row and for more
consolidations before the momentum tends
to shift

if the range doesn't qualify as your

the total gaining range was around uh I
think was 70% so I took a position
around 6.3 covered around five
consolidation is around six it was a
decent trade I didn't size in too much
only I think 30k shares because the flow
is 500k so you do not want to exceed 10%

okay so the for the very first ticker of
the month is Ln the initial market cap
for this one is roughly a little bit
under 1 billion so for this one uh it
did a massive consolidations in August
8th so the total dollar was traded is
roughly around 1.7 billion and we had a
big red day on the following day so
let's go to August 7th it had a massive
consolidations in the 6.7 is traded
about about 250 million volume to
calculate the pre-market it traded about
I think around 16 million shares or 20
million shares in the premarket so the
volume is not likely to exceed of the
previous day volume that's why I had a
massive red day the only reason I didn't
go really aggress on into this is there
is only two day round and typically we
want multi divers to run three days in a
row and for more consolidations before
the momentum tends to shift

there is another ticker ffie we did a
reverse split and tend to round again it
FedEd too much on the second Green Day
so that's why I had to bounce after
first red day so there one thing that
you have to pay attention to is whenever
you are shorting or using a first red
day pattern if the first red day drops
too much let's say exceeding 50% of the
total round range then going into the
following day you will have to be a
little bit careful I see a lot of people
getting squeezed in going to this St you
can see after about 11:30 went all the
way back to 8 which didn't trade that
much volume and going to the next day it
bounced then it slowly faded so should I
build a swing positions into this but
the volume is really low trading only 3
to four mini shares a day so you could
get easily squeezed up to 8 n 10ish
that's why I didn't build a swing
position into this not very ideal

welcome to this YouTube videos and today
we're going to go over some of the
tickers that happened last week and
definitely the market has been gaining
tons of volume compared to the last
couple months I think the last relative
play we had was BB by was trading 300
million bombing a day now we're getting
tickers that's trading around 100
million volume a day but we're trading
in a completely different sector make
sure smash the like button and subscribe
and let's get into the video
so we have three tickers that happened
last week as you can see all of them are
biotechs smmt this was pretty much a
penny stock started to spec from 50
cents to three dollars now the only
shortable uh day was actually on the
last day which is Friday as you can see
now the stock is getting volume uh you
can see the volume is decreasing but
it's trading on a higher price so the
overall traded dollar is much bigger
compared to yesterday's how much dollars
being traded and it's been running for
four days and I want to go over uh the
shorting opportunities on this so first
of all I want to let you guys know that
balloteks are pretty difficult to
shortening to and the more restoring to
them the more you get a school used so
either you have to wait for a perfect
opportunities or you uh just just don't
touch at all you prefer to go along on
the first Green Day if the stock gaps up
and if the stock is under three dollars
I I don't consider as a shooting
opportunity this one went from 75 cents
to four dollar and during the four
dollar area it's consolidating I was
hoping to short into this consolidations
I wanted to wait if the consolation was
actually forming and forming a decent
top so going to Friday you can use the
yesterday's high which is the 4.50 area
shorting around there it is ideal but uh
there's two things you want to take into
considerations first of all that when
the stock is around four dollars and
it's only trading you traded 90 million
shares
overall then you want to go into the one
hour chart to actually see how much
volume actually traded uh in the
consolidation so starting from four uh
20 million eight four so that's 32 40 45
Mini shares traded around 4.2 so total
of 160 million dollars being traded into
this consolidations which is not enough
typically whenever you see a market cap
that's around 100 million as a starting
cap going to a multi-day runner your
dollar block typically is around 1
billion to 1.6 billion of course 160
million is definitely not enough to form
a dollar block going to a second day you
can use the top to short into the
consolidations and
um since the dollar block is not enough
and typically uh when stock heading into
your Massive Resistance from yesterday
before around 12 o'clock you will start
the momentum shift and start going down
going to do lows but this particular
didn't really do that
so if you're short around four or four
point two we'll cover around 3.8 for a
small profit I would cover uh before one
o'clock since the stock is now
performing any type of momentum shift
sign I wouldn't be too aggressive
showing this smmt is likely to go higher
uh since you have a neutralized area
which is the first red day around four
this is likely to go ahead heading into
the
um at least twice as much of the
consolidation so at least eight dollars
um that's for smmt uh do not go to
grossfulness the technical analysis does
not support going to shore so be patient
on this one we have a m a m this is
another about attack I went from 50
cents to four dollars went up almost a
thousand percent on Friday and uh for
now it's a first Green Day uh tons of
money being traded so typically on first
Green Day I do not touch this type of
play I will wait until the second Green
Day either it goes parabolic and comes
back down Consolidated for sure or uh it
keeps going if it gaps down on Monday uh
trades no volume then
not shootable so
for specifically biotechs you want to
more focus on the perfect opportunities
perfect consolidation and perfect gap
down if you miss one detail biotics are
very tricky to play with so on the
following examples I'll give you guys
another phvs this proves why battle
texts are difficult to trade
first of all we had this semi-gap up
short push 20 after open fit it back
down they had one Kindle squeeze almost
to six to seven going to the second day
it didn't really form any consolidations
on the day that went up which is
Thursday and the consolidation time
frame is not even over three hours so it
doesn't count as consolidations remember
consolidations do require three hours of
I would say minimum time then going to
the second day gap down push back up
into the consolidations
I would say a tech sector any other
sectors other than biotech and energy
overstein gap down works very well and
if the stock tends to lose its liquidity
that's where momentum starts to ship
from the consolidation if it forms a
consolidation on the first red day
but you can see the volume is fading and
the stock is not even fading so and
typically overstand gap down Fades at
least 50 from where you start to spike
so at least Fades back to six to I'll
say lower six low second this one didn't
even do that I'll go into next week I do
not think this is a ideal short try to
not think this is the first red day
um I do not agree with that uh and the
perfect support spot you want to show it
into on Friday is probably around this
ten dollar
1050 rejection to this consolidation and
cover around 8.5 it means not
very good risk award
so
um
to be able to I was a profit from
biotechs first of all don't short into
everything gap down second wait for our
massive dollar block so either is 1
billion 1.5 billion or above a third
um it's biotech is shortable if the
stock goes a couple thousand percent in
one or two days for for a massive
momentum shift for example you can check
out DW dwac that's very good examples
for two-day Runner that goes up goes up
a couple thousand percent so that'll be
the recap for this week let me know if
you have any questions leave a comment

for all beginners we are seeing gappers
even included bounce shorts they don't
actually work that well and uh let's
take a look if you're only trading botex
there's wins and loses losses through
end of the year you will be in the
negatives and if you trade without botex
you'll be in the positive trading with
the botex and the normal play you will
be down and you can see the numbers is
not drastically big difference it's
close to 700,000 and 800,000 but all the
losses you are taking in between can
compound into much bigger profits when

so it's only like a week because it's my
birthday two days I will do something
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
what's up guys welcome to the new video
lessons of the week today I'll talk
about some key thoughts that we treat it
and lots of Runner has been happening
recently so I'm gonna talk about
changing how to actually handle low flow
and there's some patterns involved and
also how to avoid all those heavy volume
trading stocks now why you co today this
one was a low floater micro flow and
when the slow first start getting volume
for piyah medium start flow rotation for
two or three times it's typically a good
sign for long because when they are not
out a thousand percent they're only up
like 60 70 percent you can really cut
those people off-guard and they can
spike the thousand-person 500 and
love to show something that has higher
percentage gain but you can do that with
micro flow on the first screened at the
Cannes 5 3 2 mm per sent 3,000 percent
sometimes even 5,000 percent now when
you're sure if you don't have a risk
level you have the infinite risk then
once you start adding and adding you can
start having bigger and bigger losses
you mentally cannot blow up your account
and that's one of the rules that all
short sellers have to avoid so avoid the
first Green Day with massive rotation
especially when it's on parabolic in and
you can now stop parabolic in to the end
and even from basically two to ten in
one parabolic and you didn't even have
any Pope acts in the middle and later on
stocks on consolidation in the 90/10 as
I said when the flow we start rotating
over 10 times 15 times and they start to
have price exhaustion's but this one did
not consolidate for that long you only
consolidate about three hours typically
consolidation comes in at noon like 12h
start concerning to the 4 but this one
was trained in 30 min Evol you and I
didn't Constitution that long and in the
meanwhile I did not have any pullback so
you cut so many short sellers off guard
and so many of that on the water and
after squeeze 2:17 and difficult
overextend gap down today
finished relatively weak so if till they
can gap down under ten or maybe under
nine then there's not more downside to
go but other than that shares to borrow
a little bit you expensive today and the
South drop from 18 and 11 I think that
can arrange is not very predictable but
we'll see about tomorrow I think
tomorrow will have a decent downside if
it gaps down
pti he actually traded about 10 million
law in the pre-market so when you see 20
million monetary markets going to trade
over like a hundred million shares of
the day and we took a look at the
historical chart if it's not treating
100 million shares a day before then
this chart is going to have a fresh
pattern fresh chart nothing is very
predictable so especially on those
massive gaps they already gap so much
and their favor short sellers but it's
treating so much volumes when they're
straining so much volume then reverse
the buyers when two favors are conflict
with each other then you can't really
make decisions either to go short or
long so conflict actors trying to avoid
as much as possible this is that's why I
avoid PTI on make the temptu shorting
the cat up this morning but Carlos is
very quickly and go to avoid all those
massive headache and tomorrow I don't
really know what's gonna happen
you can either gap down with gap out
it's a 50/50 but you links to the lungs
to the buyers and the short sellers
density why capping up in after hours
hopefully gets this amount of volume
then maybe you can go along a little bit
because the markets really hard training
really heavy volume so every single
chart becomes fresh chart when you're
treating your fresh are on the first
green day that's of no touch for short
sellers and everything can become a
potential buy especially on those micro
flow why CEO and the YC opened up a
bunch of temporary plays as well
something like CC CL and finished pretty
weak today so hopefully we can get
another bounce tomorrow maybe in the
Seventeen's
4y CEO but it's very unlikely public
down tomorrow and I just and just
finishes the entire round by the way if
you guys are interested in inner circle

if you're a green just be happy about it
what's up guys Steven experience I've
been gone for a long time I was
traveling and teaching some students in
person so if you're interested I will
put a link below and go ahead register
so today we're going to talk about some
weak sectors that was happening in last
couple of weeks and they were very very
hyped some tickers are going 20 cents to
two dollars three to twelve where
someone goes to Tony sense even to ten
dollars so they're going a supernovas
every word going up two thousand percent
to each other now the key is to figure
it out when to have the right entry
because in bigger market cap is going to
be bigger resistance so the bigger of
the market cap and the bigger the
resistance it needs to be for you to
start entry to you to go long or go
short because there's more people
trading therefore needs to be a larger
resistance than the small cap and the
mid cap we used to trade almost all the
time so let's get into ITC so this
ticker was going from 40 cents to $2 and
I think it's a lot of people right
around here and I kind of exhausted our
unit twos and start fighting back so I'm
thinking this why I should do offering
because if they kind of leave money do
you need to rise some money so probably
on fades back to 1 or 1.25 that's my
prediction for the next few days or next
couple of weeks because there's so many
support and treating 40 minutes 40
minutes years 30 minutes years so it's
gonna take a long time to fight back so
this one leans more towards to swing
trade ITC for now I don't see any upside
on ITC
because there is so many resistance up
in the $2 ish
that's my thoughts for ITC
see
I can see I don't really treat billion
dollar market cap for the last couple
years and you can see this massive on
trade and eighty miniature traded in the
twelfth dollar and there's about two
resistance right around here
they're a long run to have dollar ish so
I doubt this one will bounce back and
break $12 probably gap up tomorrow and
have a nice feedback later on the day
but this one will be also a swing
positions because they're in ArchiCAD it
takes a long time to drop and as in day
trading I think it's better to split two
positions what I mean spring to position
means spooning your cow into two
separate parts one can you swing when
you can do day trading so it's basically
a trading me like aggressive income
versus passive income swing trading is
more like passive patrons more
aggressive so I think a waiting all
those opportunities are laying all over
the market I think it's to say this way
to it's to grow fifty percent of your
account goes this way fifty percent you
can go to goes to day trading now until
I ta ry and this ticker on its beam has
been going off for the past couple
couple weeks and their fundamentals are
relatively pretty good so I mean not
really eager to short this and it's not
treating that much volume and there's
not much very solid resistance I can see
from the chart it's Charlie's brand-new
so I don't know what it's gonna do and I
just gonna wait and see what happens
next I think that's my thoughts for a
receptor and also I'll talk about a
little bit mentality or little trading
tips for you guys I see a lot of people
are yes may I make make are making money
recently and the reason why making large
amount of money
can lead into your last because it's
what going through in their mental so
let's say for example you you are up
$5,000 today now suddenly the stuff
doesn't do what you want to do then you
bounces back and you covered or you are
sold your positions you made about
$3,000 and your mental it will be going
through with that I should make $5,000
today not next time you either gonna be
more greedy or either
feels like that the markets own you with
a $2,000 on cash then you will just lead
to you have bigger egos and more
positions and more really and that's
exactly wrong all I should treat the
market I think that's all beginners
people are making mistakes so hopefully
when you start with your day if you're a
green just be happy about it in day
trading industry I think the hardest
thing is to fight through your mental
and treat it like your business like a
business or treat it like practice the
more you practice the better you will be
it's not like something you can go and
make a ton of money in one day and
that's that's that's for a lottery so a
lot of people will tends to think that
way but if you think okay - I made
$3,000 I'm grateful started my day fresh
tomorrow do you want to be doing and
just keep practicing and if you think
more conservatively you can achieve
consistent profitable much quicker than
you think so that's a little tips for
today and hope you guys know something
from listen today bigger market caps
they tend to drop slower the tends to
spike slower and they don't balance they
don't decline that fast
so people are day trading the stocks
there tends to be used leverage that's
and mistakes so don't use beverage on
those big market caps stay on your Sam
risk level be grateful if you're a green
today and that would be for today thank
you very much

can memorize that in your head well if
you're tracking your data and it shows
the average fading percentage is around
30% or 26% if you're on to get more in
detail you want to track manually by
yourself and to make sure recognize okay
well between the market cap around 100
million to 500 million The Fading
percentage is 30% for between 0 to 100
million The Fading percentage is 35% so
there is a very small difference you can
memorize by yourself I would recommend
doing that for yourself then another
thing that I want to mainly Track by
himself after I get the entire database
is you want to make sure that let's say
a ticker has a resistance around 50
million and within 6 months and you're
shorting into resistance that's close to
the resistance you want to track how far
you are from the resistance you want to
track how much volume you traded what
it's approaching to the resistance
what's the highest volume on the 2minute
chart

[Music]
what's up a Stephen Dexter today we're
gonna talk about a little bit about
April April it's pretty much very very
boring
I haven't placed that minute rate
there's no pictures in April super
boring and very low volume so today I'm
gonna go over some of the particulars
that happen in April and little bit of
adjustments while you careful with in
the future let's get into it
ft ft this one was a gap pop short if
you don't know the criteria you need to
watch the DVD now this is some of the
key component you need to be pay
attention to so you see this one pollen
to bottom and typically when stock
losses on the bounce right with a crack
it's very difficult for them to come to
the original level where you broke down
so I'm gonna say crack here then you
bounces back up to 205 this is the
signal that the stock will get choppy as
soon as you see that if you have any
interest in a short I would suggest get
out and just watch for the next support
to be crap and that's where I waited we
did not crack in that 1.80
and they bounced again so once it does
is one two three support sing and try to
bounce off the crack level and with all
that signal that means today is not a
shore so especially in the morning you
can wait on to opportunity to see what's
going on but typically for me if you
start to get choppy and scanning a query
getting volume and I'm just out for a
day so that's 4 ft ft now that's how you
really trade on the first screen that in
a second there you can use a pattern
called Oberstein gap down once the stock
gapped down you can see you bounced off
it's reading really low volume now the
reason why I did not short ft of T you
can see this consolidation range between
1.93 and they started with 75 cents so
the total gains around $3 the
consolidation range is 1.5 that's around
50% of the entire game now once you have
that since the support and the
resistance are very it's so wide and
prices jumping 50 percent of the entire
range which is really difficult to find
a resistance you can say all resistance
to 1.19 can say resistance that three so
when you sure we can't really find a
very very specific resistance and you
have this large range you don't know
really where the stocks gonna tap out so
what you can do sometimes if the range
is a little bit smaller you can say I'm
gonna entry one point one nine and add
two point two five add two point six but
if the range gets too big you cannot
control average once you can now control
Everidge you cannot control your risk
management so that's very very important
if you can't control it then you're
gonna have a really bad risk award and
that's how you get squeezed that's how
you take a loss that's how you make
mistakes so they're very important on
the 50ft and this kind of pattern happen
happens a lot just be very careful on
shorting and to go along let's say to go
on long into this breakout typically on
a massive gainer
or in the pre-market the breakout is
typically not as strong since it's not
at micro flow so that's why don't go
wrong into this pre market breakout most
of the time to fake out sometimes it's a
breakout where situations that breakout
for like 100 percent sixty percent so by
statistics if the volume is less than
the previous day highly likely it's
gonna fade that will be the pattern for
F T of T now let's talk about RBZ this
one happened on Friday and you can see
this consistently holds from $4 to 27
first it's a microphone you can see it's
about 2 min and it's a decent low cap
and when you see very very low volume
and you can see consistently training
out with mass amount of range let's say
now 4 to 12 but you only took about 125
on that's really low volume considered
to be on spec your hundred-percent
unless you see that with low volume
there's gonna be a huge spread and to be
able to execute a really good
price is super super difficult so I
don't understand people were chasing for
a beginner if you chase them this is
your mistake even though you made money
so that will not keep you consistently
in a stock market that's for our busy
this one's very similar to hunt hounds
very classic intraday hope with
manipulations and with super low line
this one traded even lower volume than
rpz traded about 70 ktk volume so with
little volume spiking large percentage
always always try to not treat it at all
on the current day we have a play in
coming Monday PP th this one I will say
it's a bounce or not very sure since
still micro flow I just want to be very
careful about the sticker BP th that
squeeze many many people back in March I
think there is some resistance around 30
I would say 26 and heavy resistance at
37 so for micro flop if you're a
beginner tends to stay away and try to
explain some of the a very dangerous
component and little bit adjustments on
cap up short so if you liked this video

and there if the stock is easy to borrow
and there's too much volume you will
reduce the reward for stock going down
so there's not much reward going down
then of course the stocks likely to to
squeeze and this is where I shorted it I
think is anywhere between
325 to 3.3 I was adding exiting uh in
the consolidations looking for a
consolidation breakdown in the late
afternoon but uh turns out had its
breakout it had multiple very fast drop
candles in in the afternoon and
typically when we run into late day that
the stock is not likely to generate more
volume going into the next day so
there's no followup and what happens is
the stock breaks out of the
consolidation Zone then they do a fake
out then crash all the way down back to
three of course this one didn't do what
I thought it would be doing so I should
have respected my risk exiting the
consolidation breakout then don't even
touch it in the afternoon

[Music]
what's up guys didn't that sir I'm here
with my new six-figure student he made
about 120,000 said within six months and
he's been I heard in time for almost a
year so let's hear what he has to say
he was David Gordon hey hello everyone
David Gordon I like Stephen said I've
been here three study living for a year
I've been I started trading about two
and a half years ago on my own I was
pushing buttons like a rabid monkey
trading everything I could follow
someone else into when I started
training I have had some success in
other areas of my life fairly at least
averaging of average intelligence I'm
pretty good with numbers and I really
thought that it was gonna be easy I
thought I was gonna just start trading
stocks and making money right off the
bat
so I open an account and I started
pushing buttons and losing money and
eventually I figured out that I needed
help I need a mentor and I actually my
first experience with a an education was
with Tim sites and I did and I still am
actually active in Tim sites challenge I
learned a lot of basics studying all
those DVDs and doing webinars with Tim's
guys I learned a lot of them as it's
tilings
stuff and the basic criteria answers
tickers but I was not profitable I have
a history of blowing up I've done that
on my own I did that when I was his
Sykes challenging than I did in the
beginning trying to follow ducks in the
trades that I didn't understand and fast
forward right around the time that
Steven came out with his first of DVD I
bought that I'm sort of studying it and
I knew right away that I'd found my
thing I was like it just clicked for me
that it was real but this this was
pattern
I was right at home so I studied that
and then I decided to just jump right
into territory and I'm still very
addicted to trading I had to be in
action I think that's the biggest
problem
pretty much all traitors people are
looking to trade because people are not
trying to make money
trading you for token that's how I so
now I say half jokingly that I don't
know I don't trade anymore I'm just in
it for the money I back in the middle of
January something changed for me and I
slowed way down on my trailer I started
understanding with setups I think what
it was was that as I started to
understand the setups it became really
popular to when I was trading without a
setup and I knew I was gonna lose I no
longer believed my own lies that it
might work out different this time like
all of a sudden if there wasn't a setup
I just knew there wasn't money to be
made and I slowed way down and it got
better and better to the point now right
trade you know there's a setup which
lately has not been awesome and slow
yeah so I about eight trades in July I
can't remember maybe six the June 6 or 8
in June in May but starting in January I
started making money trading the bounce
or trading the bounce plus gap up short
and in the gap up short and I love I
love trading all three of those patterns
and I've made a lot of money this month
I made a 50k 53k gross this month but
last month I made 15k the month before
that I made 20k and it was really all
the same it wasn't that I pushed harder
to make 50k the opportunities were just
there caught it when it was there
so I don't care if I make 15k next month
you know I'm not putting like a judgment
on the it's just a judgment on a my
trading the right setup yeah entering
and exiting with some being systematic
being systematic in how I trade yes
people have a lot of problems with pbt
[Music]
money as people man it's over the PT
[Applause]
without a thousand and the most
consistent passport traits that we make
her week is generally live truth or
under come up or sometimes seven church
and the PDT
allows you to train four times a week so
that's okay it's for you to make there
are the only slight disadvantage that I
would see to someone rapidity and
honestly I don't think it matters is the
fact that it makes scaling in and out
that's the only things a little
challenging but you can overcome that
challenge the truth is if you you just
don't need to trade that much yeah you
don't need to trade that much
I still work have a job I know a lot of
people that are full-time that are not
as far along as I am and they want to be
full-time traders but that just puts too
much added pressure to make money I
don't have like by working as I develop
my skills I don't need any money from
training so the trading is not money to
me I know it to a lot of people they
hear fifty thousand dollars in
it's a lot of money there's a lot of
money I'm not discounting the value of
the dollar but it's not about dollars to
me it's just about learning to master
the craft hit the right trades make the
percentages I don't look at it in terms
of dollars I'm looking in terms of
percentages yeah
wins and losses percent gain you know
and that you've been were okay look at
this right here the number one thing
that I would tell a new person is just
to stop trading just to slow down it
doesn't matter how long these patterns
offer they happen with enough frequency
and they have a good enough we need
percentages of pattern and they offer a
good enough average gain that's another
thing the average gain is that these
aren't staffing patterns you take big
moves you take big chunks of a good
amount of range and these patterns just
offer plenty of opportunity to make
money you don't have to I like the way
you say you're a day trader but you look
at it as a long-term investment in terms
of how often the patterns happen what
they offer you and you don't worry about
what you're making on this one tray you
make a lot
those incremental how much money
never to find those better so in the
beginning when I started with Tim Sykes
you were in the chat room occasionally
he would pop in at the time you were
already very successful and so we would
be really excited when you would pop in
and you would you know maybe you will
talk about a trade give it to or to some
kind of some kind of information about
trading and so I knew who you were you
were you know kind of legendary status
as a trader in there and there was a lot
of buzz around when your DVD was coming
so I was aware of it so that's hot doubt
and the DVD LED meets of two three two
three is such yeah I feel like the
fights if I say the way that I really
feel that your bed so it's a lot of
money yeah because a lot of money in
terms of if you're working a job I
understand
the cost of chair 3 is a it's a chunk of
change but relative to what Stephen is
giving you if you do the work it's
nothing I mean I've made more money in
one trade that has cost me the team with
you all year and I and then for tier
three you get two webinars a week that's
what they tell you in the agreement but
in fact we hit three webinars or four
webinars if there's a if there's a
runner or something hot Stevens in there
so it's a steal I almost want to turn
off the camera but you know speaking to
that the amazing thing about and I I'm
not saying this like an expert you've
taught me this but I believe it because
it makes perfect sense that these
patterns are never gonna go away because
they're based on the resistance created
by all the new people that are coming in
to learn how to trade stocks and doing
what I did in the beginning what we all
do in the ratio it doesn't matter if it
doesn't matter if unbreakable
resistances is 60 million shares today
and a year from now maybe 60 million
shares there's just light resistance but
it doesn't matter because there'll be a
new number that would represent them
breakable yeah so that's why people when
asked to be a lot of padding gets
outdated it never got out because we're
using historical and current day
compared to each other get the ratio and
make sure we keep safe okay so I have a
job I actually am a business owner I own
part of the business and I'm 49 years
old which is you know young well it's
not real young I still have plenty of
life ahead of me but I want to but I
want to enjoy it more I want to free up
my time I want more freedom of time for
family for travel and so what I'm trying
to do in a very systematic safe way is
start to replace my income with the
training so that I can transition out of
having a day job and eventually with no
stress training the same way that I
trade now which is not worrying about
the money from day to day when I trade
I'm not worried about the money because
I don't need the money I pay my bills
from working when I transition out to
full-time training I want to be just as
stress-free where I just have my systems
in place I'm systematic
that's my dream it's not a lofty dream
it's it's going to happen let us say
something that sounds crazy I'm a
seven-figure trader in the making I know
I know I'm not making seven figures now
I don't say that from arrogance
you go and this morning at 3:00 in the
morning when everyone was asleep I was
entering statistics I was up for you so
I'm doing the work but the point is
statistically the patterns offer up
seven figures a year yeah it's there all
you have to do is become competent
understand how to manage your money how
to manage your risk how to trade these
patterns and allow the account to grow
and the liquidities there can make seven
figures like this it's not a lofty dream
to me it's just it's laid out in front
of me

Language: en
well so what do you think of all the
masteries no this time this masteries I
think it was similar to last ones so it
was amazing this such of so much details
and content that you don't get anywhere
so I try to give me more like new
information yeah because I try to get
back my time spent to get new things up
and to get a pattern Muniz out of it and
second yeah I think with this joining
this with a with the DVD and the the
webinars is just you have the complete
set skills package with package because
you get the details the finest details
here that I mean you would think maybe
one year to figure out by yourself
probably I would never get them I like
that ducks went over to formulas more at
once if you have any questions there is
never like oh why you asking this
question before time like let me go over
one more time yeah and you can take
questions universally right wait
just show it your Christmas he needs to
go over another pattern order once or
twice or attempt to doesn't have
problems doing it as long as we're all
learners
I think the masteries is basically like
an updated next part of the DVD have
reviews every pattern and gives you
updated patterns so you are always
up-to-date and I appreciate that you
always unveils new patterns here l at
the masteries so it's very worth it to
come here and almost feel like if you
just stared stay at tier 2 it's almost
like not worth it you have to get the
flow experience with
masteries the depth of knowledge that I
this is a thermal invented and the depth
of knowledge that I get each time it's
it just fills in gaps that I was trying
to fill myself and
silly stuff this week of the execution
the entries and the way you're looking
at price action in relationship to
volume some of those things are in the
in the videos when I was trying to
bridge the gap myself and with some
assumptions and so the clarity that
comes out of each mastery helps you
solidify and have confidence in your
entry so that you're it takes the
emotion out of it and then what the
understanding that comes through those
fine details which are so obvious to you
with all your experience it just it
makes it it increases your confidence
and entry so I think that ultimately
what this allows us to do you've
condensed so much experience I mean all
the hours you put in it's condensed and
it's it's about efficiency because we
come through here and we only spend two
days but we gather you know years of
this w in a short period of time so
that's it's it's it's just makes you
into a more experienced trader from a
wisdom standpoint not from an execution
standpoint but that'll eventually come
on your own so I just think this huge
value in in what you show and what we
take home and it's only as good as what
we do it because you look if you come
home and you don't review the content
it's gone so that's what taking the
notes reviewing on a regular basis is
key to a lot because of some of the
stuff that you went through this weekend
we can't get rid of that right so I
appreciate you reviewing some of the
stuff but it's up if the content is new
each time you know there was maybe a 20%
review here and then the 8% was was all
new content because the market does
change yeah so adapting to it
ever-changing market this is something
that Alex might seem to us regardless of
one's being offered yeah you keep doing
this to make it calming
let it change what better example then
forget that we were getting crowded we
were all
losing money on death wounds because it
always creased and now we have a new
pattern that's we just wait and we make
the money on the second bathroom I mean
just constantly adapting and figure it
out I think the thing that I that I've
seen that this is my second session a
couple big things that I've learned one
is the mechanics of how to do things and
there's a quantification of how to do it
so you know how much your risk is and
how much your benefits going to be the
other thing I really enjoy is just
people get to see all types of Ages all
types of backgrounds and for my second
time I've seen several people that are
now being successful when they first
came here in the first session they were
really beginners to me that's kind of
proof in the pudding the system works
and you can actually quantify and talk
to people I made so much money last year
and you can see that it's real it's not
just I think that new prison first time
yeah so I'm probably the newest when it
comes to trading all round here and I
definitely think I should have watched
the trading techniques DVD before coming
here just to have just a better
foundation of understanding your
concepts but I did learn a lot I learned
I learned a lot of advanced concepts
that I don't fully understand yet but I
know after I go home and review the DVD
it'll all piece of stuff together but he
had two things I really did appreciate
it was your patients around the
questions even though some of them are
very simple and basic or very beginner
level and then really I'm spending the
time with the group end and asking
everybody questions getting to know
everybody and all their backgrounds in
their history and their trading
experience it was really useful so I
look forward to the may date Jimmy's
going to tell us that in three two
so I look forward I look forward to
coming back in May you're going to a guy
who anyone after I watch the DVD a few
times you should click OK well I'll be
good yeah I also appreciate um ducks
goes over things here at our basically
almost impossible to describe in
webinars for example when he injured
shed and Tier three is that I enter here
because stuffed candle and I asked him
in the chat what are you mean by his
stuff Cambodia and he says well this is
really hard to explain
whereas here masteries you actually like
put them up in and true all the
different candles dark consider stuff on
the end details and that he magic volume
so like there's a lot of things are like
really impossible just to UM discuss and
she in Weber dart and where he just
fills the gaps right here yeah one of
the best investment we ever made is tier
3 and coming to these masterminds one
because you have the possibility to ask
him any questions you want it is always
gonna be responded to you you know and
he doesn't do it like enough AB way to
just get excited and he goes like yes or
no you stop telling him about the market
aid that's what do you think about this
room he can spend like four days talking
just about the market and telling you
exactly how what it things and
everything and that's why I like about
dogs and that's what I'm here this is my
second time that I'm here and I think I
always get in a great value on on
everything that he talks and he teaches
you like today it was it was really good
spending all of these two days learning
because that's what we came from and the
other thing is the other point is that
it's the option to live trade if there
are but there's no lack of value when
there's no trade in fact there's the
opportunity for live teaching that you
can't
like you mentioned yeah on whether so
any time that that's would have
otherwise been spent with live trading
is more than filled with valuable
content that he adds describes it
meticulous detail what he's thinking and
what the markets thinking and that's
what's the the thing that's I think I
like the best about his system is that
its predictability comes from the
psychology of why the price action why
the trade behaves as it does so you can
predict what people are thinking and
counter that strategy and that's there's
[Music]
a lot of psychology is work but you know
it's different that chatting in the the
website is different
I'm sorry other questions and here's
more until they'll say more because some
love that can't really explain have to
draw and to give it a go one on one
message because the more people that you
can give them different expansion people
have different questions to me so
sometimes we don't get the answer and
it's faster it's more updated strategies
as a cube X 3 mount your strategy maybe
sometimes I there's no strategy but I'll
say 15 is smart here
[Music]
I'm using mother heavy as a family
we're just tweaking do the original
strategy so we don't always that's right
yeah and statistics to the brilliance of
applying psychology and statistics for
predictability is you know you know when
to cover you know what end
yeah takes critiques

SOURCE VIDEO: Consistently Profiting$ From the Stock Market - 3 Tips From Dux [fO2sHhcALo8].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys doing that sir I've been
getting a lot of questions for people
ask me how to really stay consistently
profitable and I'm gonna give you some
tips that is going to help you guys
throughout this process so first now a
lot of people don't really look at their
account statements because when you are
trading you have to go through your all
your account statements and you're gonna
see okay where do you typically make the
mistakes and what is your biggest loss
almost all my losses comes from random
trades that I don't know what I'm doing
and I know I kind of know because it
doesn't really fit my criteria but half
of them fits the criteria so it doesn't
really fit the pattern and that still
use sim on a size to go into the tray
and it turns out to be a huge loss
another one will be and keeping fighting
the stock multiple times on a day
fighting in one starting twice and third
times and keep getting more frustrated
and each time I'm using more and more
sighs I want my money back that would to
regard you through all the losses that I
have experienced that's the first thing
you need to look at your biggest
mistakes your account statement and
where you've made all your mistakes
because that is where how you can become
truly consistent power flow learn from
your mistakes and make sure next time
can improve it and to get it better or
don't try that at all because in the
market you don't really wanna improve
any mistakes you want to avoid risk as
much as possible so when you are making
mistakes
and you are keep making those mistakes
on the same pattern so don't treat that
pattern anymore and let's get rid of
loads of mistakes two years ago I always
think if I can improve on my mistakes
and they can get better but turns out to
be I started focused and narrowed down
more and more of my own pattern the best
proper pattern instead of trying to
improve on some pattern that doesn't
really exist yes the last becomes
smaller but law still allows so you want
to get rid of all the losses and keep
all the wins and for beginners narrow
down your strategies
start with one strategy it's because you
can't have diamond strategies and
everywhere you can't really know it on
your phone
you don't have that much equities as a
beginner to trade all those patterns now
what I did is I test one pattern I feel
good about it and the test about 10,000
samples or thousand samples to see
what's the average human rate and how
much do they happen per year and it kind
of simulate how much money I'm going to
make per year because well each
strategies I have for average again it's
the average getting is about 20% the
risk is about 5% and you can kind of
using the account let's say this fair
I'm going to use 10% McCown and I'm
going to gain 20% next time that 20% of
the profit adding to account then use
the 10% of the profit plus the account
putting it in our trade then you can
make better game so you kind of
snowballs into the end of the year now
in the meanwhile I don't really trade
other patterns but I use paper tray to
test other patterns to see if they works
because a lot of people go through the
internet there are a bunch of patterns
but they don't really test it by
themselves trust yourself test the
pattern on yourself and to see if it
works or not if it doesn't work get rid
of it if it works make it your own so
that's what I've been through
almost those three years one of the most
important thing is learn from mistakes
improve and narrow down your strategies
the third thing is timewise
so in the market time is 8:00 to 4:00
and after hours 4 to 8 so all those
times people don't really know where do
you focus on so the most volatile times
it's between 9 to 11 and that's where I
stay most consistent and profitable and
in the midday zone I don't profit that
much right there so I can profit that
much even though they say it's power I
don't believe it
a test method myself doesn't work for me
I don't try that at all in pre market
doesn't have enough liquidity so I can
kind of give you where the resistance is
I still don't fit at that time period so
the most a lot of the time most
profitable time is 9 to 11
I typically stay for those two hours I
give webinars to my students in the
studio hours because we execute
90% of our trades between his time zone
then later on because I was studying
from 94 and I wasted so much time just
by focusing on the best all the time
trying to figure it out
is there any pattern in the mid day but
turns out mid days typically most
consolidations and counselors didn't
break our conversion breakdown that's
only the two things that most of time
happens afternoon the afternoon crackles
after our squeeze and all that it
doesn't really give you a good odds of
it except very where scenarios so most
of the patterns that happens either
pre-market breakout or bounce or gap up
sure that all happened in early morning
so people are looking for like full time
hard time I don't really suggest you to
go for time because the most consistent
time is that ninety seven I filter out
everything that I don't need it I don't
need the bad patterns that don't need
the midday I don't need the power hour I
just focus on this specific 9011
and I try to correct all my mistakes
perfect your strategies shrink down your
risk and increase your maximum profit
and that's how you really stay
consistent profitable so that'll be all
for those three tips hopefully it's
helpful and leave a comment below and I
will see you guys next video

SOURCE VIDEO: Cracking the Code： How to Short Stocks safely and make $30,000 in one trade [LE2qpSI_Yhk].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
there were some interesting place so
let's get into
it the first one we have is s AI this is
uh a bounce short uh that happened today
consolidation is around six whenever you
want to short into bounce short you have
to be very careful to look at uh the
flow and the market cap if the flow is
less than 3 million be careful less than
1 million be extremely careful because
flow that tight you typically need big
range for you to be able to enter a
short when you are spotting the
resistance around 5.5 and you're are
looking at $4 to five that's only
up 20% so it doesn't really qualify as a
b short and the range is too tight so
shorting around five is not very ideal
doesn't really matter how big the
resistance is first of all you want to
look at the resistance second you want
to look at the range if the range
doesn't qualify as your criteria then
it's not going to be shortable so I took
my entry around six the total gain range
was around uh I think was 70% so I took
a position around 6.3 covered around
five it was a decent trade I didn't size
in too much only I think it's 30k shares
because the flow is 500k so you do not
want to exceed 10% of the flow and I
made the 30k on this day then let's go
into uh the most recent Gap up short I
think it was a reverse split September 7
yeah it was a reverse split so it's a
fresh chart typically when you want to
sure a lower float always want to wait
for a push this one pushed exactly 30%
so for lower float average pushing
percentage is much bigger than the
smaller float and also the Gap up
percentages has to be over 100% And I
took a very small positions around
7.7 in didn't cover exactly at the
bottom covered I think was 1/ fth at at
the bottom and covered the rest of it
around 6ish so wasn't a a great trade
because it didn't give me enough reward
and you cannot hold the 500k flow
overnight
so even gap down today still gap down
the following day it's still not really
tradeable those are for the bound Shore
in the most recent tickers uh we have
pretty much all lower flow less than 1
million I would recommend the beginners
to not trade those tickers because they
are not uh very predictable and it takes
extreme uh risk management to to be able
to make money on those stickers and also
the locates are very expensive as well
and let's take a look look at the most
recent Hypes that's uh tpst this is a
ticker that went from 10 cents to 10 and
I took a loss on tpst around here it
bounced uh went super parabolic uh I
think it was up around 2,000% took a
entry on the short into the bounce
average around 4.45 risking 75% of the
range which is risking around 4.7
covered 4.7 then that's my entry took a
decent loss on it because I sized in
relatively big I think I took a 40K 50k
loss going to the following day didn't
really short into it because it's
already down 50% it does bought a bunch
of simpath play into the market like
opgn but those stickers are way too
cheap they're around $3 so it's not very
ideal then uh going forward a stock
pushed back but there is no actual
resistance that was formed the only
consolidation that was formed which is
that current day and going to the next
day people are shorting it using overate
gap down or the volum comp person uh
compared to the yesterday's volume which
traded on this day 126 million but the
range was too tight it's only up around
60% now 128 million shares so it's
really big volume on really short range
typically that will cause a squeeze like
this to yesterday so once it faded back
I didn't really touch it because you do
not want to short into support which is
around seven so once it dipped back
under six then I might be inrig to take
but overall it's a about tech I wasn't
very very interested in this at all I
formed a resistance but it was cancelled
on the following day so the chart itself
it might be a decent swing trade risking
7.29 but other than that it's not really
doable the most recent Market actions
they are much lower priced compared to
what we used to see uh the starting
price is always on sub $1 so typically
we don't trade tickers at stops three
and they go all the way up to three then
we might take a trade so with the price
range we're dealing that's so low we
typically can't size in that many shares
and uh that's the desert Advantage from
that compared to 2021 that average price
we traded is around 10 to 50 so which
means you can manage your risk better
and sizing bigger as well all right guys

[Music]
welcome to this video so today I want to
talk about the current marketing
conditions
um that I experienced this year and I
found out there's a little bit
difficulties especially on tracking data
so for today I want to share my
experience and let me know how you think
and before we get into this video make
sure to click the like button and
subscribe and let's get into it so today
I want to focus on the opportunity that
we have in 2022 compared to 2021 uh
especially on the consistency of
unstable data Trend so back in 2021
especially on Bouncer and GAP offshore
we had in total of 120 to 150 mass
amount of opportunity but most of the
opportunity came in later the year we
still haven't gone into the later year
in 2022 yet during the summer Market
typically slow but in this year we
pretty much had two to three a really
good place like MTD NGO gme MMC and
tbbies three of them are medium stocks
and two of them are sympathy plays and
one is energy one is IPO so those are
the five opportunities that we have that
you can make really good money on but in
terms of bound Shore and the Gap up
shore plays there's not many of them not
gapped over 70 percent for all the
tickers that went over 70 either they
are IPOs or a micro flow so in terms of
strict criteria it's hard to trade on
those
um either low volume on IPOs with
massive amount of spread or with the
microflow that's after reverse split the
flow goes down to 300K to 500k it's
pretty much impossible to trade as well
in 2022 what I noticed is sometimes you
get mass amount of volume like bbby you
get 400 million a day and the 300
million dollar in the next day then this
week we're trading 1 million shares in
one day and shph or HKD and all the
those stickers are trading really low
volume and the spread is really big and
can't really setting that much on that
really low amount of volume there is I
would say not very consistent amount of
volume that's being placed into the
market in 2021 we have uh consistently
about increasing you can kind of predict
the trend let's say today the stock
traded maybe 400 million dollars on the
current day then tomorrow maybe trade
anywhere between 470 500 million it's
you know doable trading that type of
volume amount and it's quite I would say
easy to be able to manage that type of
bond because it's not and you know
fluctuating back and forth back and
forth It's only increased maybe less
than 10 percent or maximum 20 percent
but in 2022 what we have is some days we
trade 400 million volume in one day and
some days we trade one million shares in
one day so there is a I would say
drastic difference between current
market volume it's not uptrending it's
not down trending it's just jumping
everywhere because when people see
opportunities they they hop in and
pretty much most of the time there's
zero liquidities out there compared to
2021. in terms of data tracking it's
really difficult because it's hard to
predict what's the next I would say
dollar amount will be traded in one
ticker especially on Gap hop Shore about
Shore or any type of pattern that you're
you're currently trading because the
volume it just jumps either 10 times in
the next day and it drops 10 times uh in
the next day so from what I noticed and
I kind of want to make us a solution
about this problem that we run into
especially the liquidity issues uh I
think what you should do or what I do is
you split into two sections and that one
section that you track all the mass
liquidities when the market comes back
use that data especially just for Mass
liquidity or mass amount of volume
tickers and one sections that you track
is all the little bonds together like
HKD
shphh and to see if there's any type of
correlations and seasonally let's say we
have one HKD and after you trapped a lot
of short sitters on the upside on really
low volume then we get into a bigger
amount of volume in the next play so you
want to track them I would say in your
timeline to see after how many of those
low amount of volume plays then we get a
bigger play so in this way it makes it a
little bit more predictable to adapting
the current market conditions is because
that if you keep expecting that the next
play is going to be very similar to the
ticker that trades to 300 million volume
in one day then it's not going to work
because we're in a completely different
Market condition now so that will be my
suggestions of adapting into the current
market and if you have any questions any
comment please leave a comment below and
and tell me what do you think so that'll
be end of this video thank you very much

SOURCE VIDEO: DPW momentum shift thoughts [fheSySS-c_Q].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
today when I talk about momentum shift
on today's DPW and this one will be
going to the DVD so now if you check
around one month's chart this stock has
been from who say 0.5 into almost $5 and
most of the time $5 is really it's a
round number and people like to shorten
to that area $5 $10 $20 all those round
numbers are heavy shorted area most of
the time and they're already explained
previously there's multiple ways to play
with dpw charts and without if the start
going to goes against you you won't be
losing that you won't be you will be cut
even more won't be losing that much
money so
how to recognize today's momentum shift
first the studies being has been a
little bit first the stock has been very
extended for last couple days and if you
take a closer look week open start
testing this resistance 4.5 and break
through that resistance and I think
today traded around here today around 30
million shares close to end of the day
today around I would say 50 million
resistance and when the stuff shows you
come firm ship and shows you the move
which is around this 4.37 area so the
today most prices are treated around
this average obviously around 4.6 area
once you take out that big support and
and I will take him I start in short
around this 4.5 area if it breaks this
4.3 and that will give me a big
confirmation of the stock is going down
because why because most of the shares
today is trade the most shares of any
time
and 70 million shares which is
considered to be was his moment and loss
and certain moment is this high of
the resistance will become unbreakable
or very unlikely to break for the past
month for the last month so tikki ensure
here it's very safe riskiness major
resistance area and stuck it gets halted
and start going down and down and adding
I won't be afraid and into this bounce
because because there's so much bad
orders around that area so adding here
ok I would say considered to be a very
very safe the ultimate risk it will be
probably around this 4.38 area initio
sure will be four point five adding
point four daughter area adding to
balance three point six three point five
area I would say total average comes out
around $4 ish so riskiness pork winter
will be very very safe entry tomorrow
this one will probably go down to the
ones maybe even load to the low twos or
low high ones probably and end up around
I was a to daughter around $2 ish so
this is my thought process for DPW and
if tomorrow pushes will very likely get
stuffed around its four dollar area and
just going straight down and drop a nine
thirty percent tomorrow almost every
single painting style to the skin so
once there a moment to start shifting
especially on those really big ones
shifting they typically go down sixty
seventy percent so I wouldn't be
surprised this one and around high seven
or the two dollar area and if I was
shorting congratulations for not showing
if you can't find shares to shore
make sure for your account get to that
trades ear or Center for an account so
that's my top process for DPW today and
good luck and good luck on the shorting
tomorrow

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hope this video helps and hope what's up
guys Steven ducks here welcome to the
new YouTube video today we're gonna talk
about some mount strategies a lot of
people are asking about and they're
requesting this videos well ducks what
kind of launch strategies do you want to
focus on and what should I do when I
have a small account throughout a couple
years I've found about like three or
four long strategies and other than that
there is not that much along strategies
around start with the first one so first
one will be OTC multi-month or motivate
breakout for a start to keep consistent
training and the volleys to be and if
you are buying the break a level it
typically takes about three or four days
to for the start to go up about thirty
sixty percent sometimes even 100 percent
but all those trades they don't really
have an often really more OTC pumps
doesn't really exist anymore so that
kind of sector kind of died off but
every now often they happens about I
will say ten times a year and they all
have that
OTC hype and they bring a lot of
sympathy plays and everything starting
with the month breakout like the big win
last year back in 2016
so that's the first lump patterns
we're being experiencing the second
pattern will be dip buying huge market
cap when they instant pool about thirty
to fifty percent typically we can see
about ten times a year something like
ITC mbb once you can find a solid
support or the most consolidating area
you can dip that from there they
typically bounce it back to from twenty
to thirty percent and you're really
showing on time so that's really really
stable pattern it's been in the market
for a while and it's really repeatable
so I think there will be a really good
opportunities for smokey on to focus on
national strategy and to slowly grow
your account it's not going to be that
fast but it's very steady and the third
a pattern will be crowded trades now
that's being happening
a lot of the time because in the
Marquise I think there's more and more
people getting into the sector and the
stock is trading 30 million 15 minutes
years 60 miniatures a day and doing that
a lot more often every single month that
we can see about 50 tickers that trades
15 meeting or above shares per day so
now think about there's 90% people going
on turns percent people going short so
if the stock has only animal and shares
to trade and one poor people get into it
so most of it will be long if the stock
is gaining in volume as up showing the
more and more people's going to get into
the round side and shorts will be over
wand
that's why product rates always our
benefit for on so if you see a ticker
that doesn't really have words and have
a solid news and it's an uptrend just
broke out the consolidation area you can
really really take the opportunity to
take a partial long in there and
especially on really low flow stops the
if it gets crowded this bike for a first
an hour or two and pull back in
afternoon if they decide to either down
toward your offering but in the morning
I think is reliable that the stock is
going to at least spike for our these to
twenty to thirty percent so you can gain
that little bit avenge out there so
going long and short people thinking
okay well if you're sure you can lose
over 100 percent your position if you're
going long you won't be able to lose
over a hundred sent of entire investment
but who will let that 100 percent just
don't cut your losses and let the start
go against you for another 100 percent
and it's all about the risk management
either short and long and if either you
want to go long bus or you want to go
short bias it's much better tuner on the
both side you can know like shorts are
thinking will benefit you to get a
better entry if you're a short sellers
you can get you're trying to learn
people who are going around can get
their mindset
- were what kind of price will hit will
cause the land buyers to start panicked
so always get to know on the both side
and the focus on those patterns will be
pretty good that has been growing marrik
talinn pretty stable for a while it
first wins
OTC multi-month motivic break a multi
day that works as well and needs to have
solid volume at least 3 million 4
million 5 million bones to be increasing
second is tip buying a huge cab that if
it's over building that's even better
pull backs about 30 50 percent they
typically our intrude a level that is
not a bad news or hope and it will
bounce about 20 to 30 percent and the
third pattern will be crowded trades and
then the third pattern you need to be
sizing a lot smaller because the winning
percentage is not as good as a previous
- you really depends on how crowded the
trades is and how big is the flow and
bigger flow will be different than the
micro flow if are both crowd either do
some research on the crowded trades I
will comment couple tickers in the
section below hope this video helps and
I'll see you guys next video

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys welcome to the second episode
of the trader podcast and today i'm here
with my assistant jimmy
uh so in this episode we got many focus
on about experienced trader versus a
beginner trader so jimmy has been
trading about almost a year now he
started with about 27 000 28 000 in his
account
and as you guys know me i've been
trading for about seven to eight years
now back in 2016 2017
i started with 27 000 and then i turned
it into
at least
10 million dollar i can say the exact
number but definitely over eight figures
so
right here
i want you guys to
kind of pay attention to
his mindset and my mindset so you can
take both lessons whenever you are in
different trading stages
so uh from here i will let jimmy take it
and he will share a little bit about his
experience uh in the last year of
trading
all right
um
my name is jimmy um not a very good day
trader that's my first label
um as steven mentioned i started trading
uh last year last january and
it has been a year now
at the first couple months it was it was
really rough and um i was constantly
facing the possibility that i could blow
out my accounts
any day any day i wake up maybe i'm not
thinking straight in the morning
or i just woke up late or woke up too
early trading in the pre-market
um
like many other
day traders who just started their
trading journey
i have a lot of misconceptions about
trading i always thought well i can
it was it was really messy at the
beginning because i always think that i
can go like oh in into a very regular
trade and then i end up losing big on
something
and right now my progress in day trading
is i'm
i'm down like 6k yeah from the very
beginning
yeah overall down 6k
first six month i was down about
uh 8 000
and um later
there was a month last october which is
the really very crazy month um
i took another approach
the approach was i would just kind of
follow you strictly and i'm not gonna
trade on myself and um that month i was
up 22k
and
later when i when i switched
to
kind of a half and half
whenever you have a trade i'll follow it
and
whenever i trade
i'll just trade on my own
i still lose money that way even though
i'm winning on your on the following
trade
so here comes one question as you guys
watching the podcast
so
you're a person not really close to
stephen and you're pretty much beside
him all the time so why not just follow
him
pretty much 100 of the time and you will
be able to make you know at least six
figures a year with your account size
yeah uh that's a very
viable question because i was because in
my mind after so many trades that i
might that pull off on my own i just
start to ask myself okay i think the
most efficient way to trade to treat
this stock market
is actually to follow every single one
of your trade and not doing it on my own
because that's see this is another
question that other people will be
curious about is
that
well they before they go into day
trading they will look at the statistics
94 people loses money in the stock
market and i think i told you guys in
the last podcast only maybe five
people can make over five million
dollars per year in the entire i would
say brokerage which has about 25 000
people and three of the three out of
those five people keeps rotating out
because they blow up in uh in
uh maybe
some takers like dwc
so once they know the statistics right
and they see somebody like me and you're
already close to me so
you don't even have to go through making
so many trades by yourself
other people just be looking at me says
okay i'm just gonna follow stephen from
the beginning i'm not even gonna trade
by myself
so what's your take
um
my take on that is uh i actually i just
had an idea popped up towards that topic
because my take on that is if i see if i
do that
i know i can be profitable because the
statistic
statistics tells me so
um but if i do that i'm worried i'm
worrying about like someday i may not be
able to follow your trade and then this
may not be
a very consistent
path for me to take on but then i was
like
if i trade on my own
that's not consistent at all either so
if i just maybe if maybe the following
part is actually the learning part that
i should be taking on
instead of like just trading on my own
so one of the things
outsides a more logical way
is
if jimmy tends to follow me from the
very beginning and he turns 27 000 into
six figure plus
um
and
his main focus is to be consistent
profitable without me
being present
so
that takes
trades by himself and takes practices as
well
so if i'm not there and he has a six
figure account once he makes a mistake
that will be a much severe mistake
uh
you know on a six-figure account instead
of you know 27 000 account so in
if you if i present that way uh it's
much better to make mistakes when you
have a smaller account then you have a
bigger account
that's my take yeah
i agree
um and i just have something in my head
um and and i think the following trade
part
is not only about
when we have a trade it's also about
how much position size you should be
putting in after you took a loss after
your account gets decreased to a point
and what's the new ratio of you putting
in to that account i think um
i think when i'm not following you
when i'm not following your trade what i
do is okay on the first day say i lose
about
5k on a on a one fifth or one third
position size and
the second day i would think about
making it back or
or third day whenever there's a
opportunity and i'll go in the same size
and i'll lose it again and again and
again until
my count is non-existent and um
but actually the the right way to treat
that situation from your perspective if
you are to treat my account instead of
me
i think it will turn out really
differently ever since the first losing
trade
so there is
more like a derivative about whenever
you're on a losing streak
that every loss you take and and if it
turns out become a consistent loss
then you have to slowly reduce your size
and for
uh
somebody that followed me 100 of the
time and they are looking at me trading
different takers that's fine and you can
look at my entries and exit but the one
thing
that i can't
pay attention to is my size
because i have my own idea about my
sizing into different wedding percentage
pattern
some tickers are sizing in two million
dollars some ticker assistant only three
hundred thousand and for somebody as a
beginner like him all those numbers are
so big that he
barely pays attention to
so
if he cannot control
the size in different pattern which
is a big problem so if i throw a 300 000
dollar into a ticker that's not not very
profitable only maybe 65 percent winning
percentage if i take a loss
it will be relatively small and if i
throw a two million dollar i'm gonna
take her that
has eighty percent ninety percent
winning percentage if i make a win
that'll be huge the the weighing will
overwhelm the losses easily
but for somebody like him he doesn't
know the size and difference he doesn't
know the statistics behind different
patterns and winning percentages he will
throw all of the size with uh premium he
will throw i would say the same
size on all different tickers
so
that will become a whole different story
because you don't really know how to
sizing heavy into different winning
percentage pattern and that
will
basically
come out with a complete outcome
between me and him
completely different yeah
um yeah i noticed that when i was going
through your trades from a trade zero
last year um there's
uh it's the share sizes they uh vary a
lot
and um
and it seems like you control it very
well because
out of like because i do it like in a
month-to-month increment um say last
october the trade you pull off last
october you only have two losing trade
and uh
and then out of let's say i think it was
like 12 trades
on trade zero and then you only have two
losing trade one is like
700 loss
and uh one is like 200k loss or 100k
something but the winning trades are on
average the biggest one goes up to 900k
that's just the trader account um and
then average is around 500 to 300k
per trade and um
that um that that part to me is like i'm
i'm like i'm super amazed because you
control your losses
here like that portion 100k or 200k
that's your max loss there that you took
and then the average win that you took
is
i would say even 100k more than
when
than your max loss
um
and when i when i look at the position
size it's really
yeah it is really hard for me to follow
since the
since the share size is just
just really big
and um i wonder how
it i wonder if the best way for me to
start practicing this is to uh is is
from what i was what i'm doing right now
which is the uh i will break down my
position size to
the small um let's say 60 percent
winning rate to 75 winning rate i'll put
down one-fifth of my account and um 80
to 80 anywhere about 80 winning rates i
would go about one-third
of my uh of my total equity um do you
think i should break it down even more
than the two position signs that's
something um
see here is the most difficult part for
sizing in
is there's a limitation about how much
you can size in
with
different account size
so let's say you only have a few
thousand dollar account you can size in
with percentages one fifth one third if
you have a fifty thousand dollar account
you can still setting one fifth one
third and if you have a 500 000 account
you have to really pay attention to the
volume and there's only specific amount
of money you can size in before you
break the pattern
so
uh that's number one you have to go
figure that one out
as you become more experienced trader
the second part
is
being flexible
with your account
going back and forth so with day trading
right you you experience uh
exponential growth within a small amount
of time
and one day your account is 27 000 one
day your account is 54 000
and the transition from
27 to 54
is you are not very experienced with the
losses you are not very experienced if
you're sizing one third that's gonna
your max loss will be this much when you
see the loss you see oh this exceeded my
normal uh losses on a 27
south 27 thousand dollar account
and you instantly freak out and cut your
losses but you are not supposed to cut
your losses so
those mental transitions is also very
important
for your trading career so
being adaptive
um
your account sizes and being adaptive on
size limitations once you become more
experienced
those two i think
uh are the most also difficult part for
you to
experience i can't really teach people
that uh because
every day your account just going back
and forth back and forth i think at one
point of my time my account was going
from
1.5 million
to lower 700k it was just going back and
forth like that
so
i couldn't control my size when i was at
1.5 000 in
500k it's easy
but when i have a 700k account sizing
500k that's almost all it yeah
so
to manage that and
whenever you are making a trading plan
it is fine to make a trading plan
whenever
uh it's in the pre-market but pretty
much all of the entry is like instant so
you have to make your decisions within
30 seconds right in those 30 seconds you
got to think about
all those risk management
make sure you're setting the right size
and make sure you have a correct risk
and make sure you have the correct
max loss
and be able to cut
once the stock reaches a certain point
so all of that information is to go
through your head
within 30 seconds so that's the hard
part it's very
it's very very easy to screw up on you
know
thinking through those 30 seconds
i've done it many times
sometimes i press the extra zero
sometimes i
didn't know my loss could get to this
big
and
that specific part for
you is
i would say to be
going from you know
thinking fast and almost feel like it's
all
i'll say
it becomes an autopilot after you do
like 100 times but for the first
50 times it's very difficult
so to control that
is also very difficult you're going to
go through some crazy losses at the
beginning which i did at the beginning
and you learn from that i think the most
important lesson no matter how i tell
people
uh what they should do what they should
not do and those type of
thinking process
produces mistakes and you gotta
experience experience those mistakes
before you become a better trader
so
knowing
um knowing what's it like when you mess
up
knowing what's it like when you mess up
yeah
and
being confident that okay if i
if i mess up this is what could
potentially happen even though i could
avoid it i still don't
know what it's like in the back of my
head and moving forward
um
yeah that i'm still yeah i'm still
digesting on the part how do you of like
how fast you
um calculate the position size and uh
and the potential risk of that you're
taking for
for
for each and different position like
for each and different pattern which you
size them differently
so what you should do is
you should write like
uh you should treat
uh different patterns like a branch so
you you look at ticker okay this is fits
certain criteria maybe it's a bouncer
gap up for overseeing gap down or first
right day or whatever it fits a certain
criteria then you branch out from this
pattern and you see okay
um
how much reward i have how much risk do
i have
uh is it really worth it to go in today
and is it very is it overextended so
the stock itself over extension volume
size
flow market cap all those things matters
and that just takes a massive amount of
experience because different ticker has
its own volume market cap flow
and
to control size
on
individual ticker that's completely
different than all the samples that you
have
is difficult
so
when you see me making a trade like dwc
and amcd and gme
i've never seen those before
yeah how do you
how did you figure out
a new position size for those
so
that comes down to
for amc
and gme
gme is reasonable because
once you dropped from 500 to 100 and
bounced back to 400
that's a massive bouncing percentages
and you have a solid risk for the
shorting too that's the same pattern as
cei so that's easy now for amc when it
dropped like that
um
for amc that was difficult mc i
i don't think i did very very well
compared to me
yeah mc was uh
it dropped in the pre-market
and i did not expecting expected dmc
bouncing all the way back
and almost
to the exact same high as
i think it was the 75
dollar area
now to control size on that one
is almost like trading
a billion dollar cap
so you know that one billion most of the
billion dollar cap has its fundamentals
so massive extensions or massive panic
will have a reverse
um
typically when it drops 75 reverses
about 50 from the bottom
so
um
now for amc and g missions are so
extended i was unsure they would
actually have a bouncing
yeah
so
for mc i did not catch the bounce for
jme uh i
packed size on it because you actually
have i have identified risk
uh for dwc the first size was small but
the rest of the size once a once pattern
was formed already i will be able to
identify
uh
the pattern that's going to play it out
so that's why it says the heavy so that
165 entry at the very top
that was like a more oh my god feeling
yeah yeah
see that that was the upgrade c
and amc that was
a solid trade
the gmail solution
llc it comes with gut feeling once it
drops the certain amount of percentages
and i can confirm panic is coming that's
where it says then
yeah so you can see
so going back to the
um the drop um
the um the sizing in
after you are confirmed it's a is a drop
because it sounds like you broke your
position size down by first very little
and then large portion once
once you you're confirmed on a certain
idea
um how do you break that down
how do you break it down
to give it a percentage
what would be
one-fifth one-third of the total
position for your first entry
uh normally i don't really break it down
that much
i will size the name based on how i want
to look at my average where
what average am i most comfortable
at when the stock is at certain point
so let's say
for amc
that top is 75 my uh
my average better be at
65 or something
right so i will size in a little bit
amount
more of like this might be the potential
momentum shift because it's up so much
once it confirmed drops it drops about
61.62 right i sat down somewhere between
and i
average those positions my
together my average will be around 67.68
so i'm sitting there
67.68
i'm very comfortable with the stock is
already at 61 and
closing to the 50s and when it drops all
the way down to 30s i feel much more
comfortable
so
you have to kind of see that
the stock current price with your
current average if it's too
if the gap is too small that's where it
makes you nervous
uh so you kind of define that comfort
zone is you want a sizing in
a small amount to drag your average up
to half the middle point that to compare
with the current price
that
gap
is your edge the bigger the gap is
the more likely you're going to profit
especially on a
stock is
down you know shifting momentums
yeah um
that's uh that's very interesting to me
because
um
for lately what i'm trying to do is uh
just one entry and one exit
i i've always have this question on
if you break your position size down by
okay the first it would be like a very
high entry
and
and then the second one's a confirmation
about something
uh once the once you confirm that this
stuck is cracking and then you can still
size in with the previous entry to drag
your average up
um
what
like what kind of
you said the the larger the gap
um from your initial entry and then the
the second confirmation
it's
when it gets bigger how is your edge
increasing
downshift momentum is when the stock
being so overextended going up a
thousand percent and it's when it's on a
confirmed down shifting per momentum it
will drop at least 50 from the
top so from that point is how close are
you from the top
i'll beat another cab so
that's that's the trick now for
all the momentum shift
tickers like
amc and gme
uh kodk
all the crazy tickers that happened this
year
those you need
uh adding
and you need
multiple entries but for regular
patterns like gap up shoulder bounce
short you don't really need
multiple entries one introvert exit and
a lot of people cannot control
their entry
based on multiple entries i'm gonna take
her
especially on multi-year honor going
really crazy
that's where they blow up their account
so that's why i recommend most beginners
don't do
try to guess where the momentum is going
to shift
because if you cannot control your
sizing
very very easy to lose 20 30 percent in
one candle so
that's my take on
the momentum shift
and regular patterns
okay so regular pattern it will be one
entry one exit get it cleared
and uh for momentum shifts you how you
you have to size in differently at
different points
would you go about
one half at the first entry and one half
of the second entry
half and one and see that's
not very ideal because one
whenever you decide to do one half
you're pretty much
you're pretty sure that the stock is
going to go down from there
so
personally for me i would drop a little
bit of size to test
yeah i would test the stock to see
my
the strength of my shares that sounds a
little bit weird is
that uh i will go in and use my size
to
uh to test the stock so i put in ten
thousand shares i put in five thousand
shares to see how far the stock will
actually drop if it drops significant
amount that makes first of all if it is
really on low liquidity
the stock would pull
really hard if it pulls really really
hard that means there's not many
buyers are in there anymore
if there's sufficient enough eq
liquidity and if you drop ten thousand
shares on it depends on the stock price
for sure if you drop ten thousand shares
on it and you
didn't really move
or
in
it pull down a little bit instantly
reverse and that's something that shows
the stock is still a lot of strength
so
i'll go in a test about a few times to
see
how my size will actually affect on the
stock
before i go in in full size so
for me
i'm more of looking at the bigger
picture uh if i can make
seven hundred thousand nine hundred
thousand
or a million
dollar trade
gold has decided within ten thousand
twenty thousand it's
nothing
yeah that
that sounds hard first of all
but uh the second is how did you start
practicing like looking at because this
is really hard to quantify you can't
really bring up excel sheet and record
what you do what you're doing when
you're testing all those shares
um
so
i guess it's all based on your feelings
and then
like how basically if i put 50 k shares
down here and then seeing how much it'll
drop here see that it's quantifiable
[Music]
see
it's kind of that way in my head yes but
it's also quantifiable um
i'm the machine by just a lot it's not
more difficult
because
whenever you are seeing so many examples
you can see how far stock will actually
pull based on different flow and market
cap you see so many of them can you know
you can see
what's the percentage you can pull
but to really actually track that with
your you know eight nine years
experience to track every single one of
that it's
a little bit difficult
so i don't think
anybody has that type of spreadsheets
that
a certain amount of size can poster a
certain percentage
of the stock and what type of
percentages is considered to be weird
was considered to be
likely reversible based on how much size
you tested like i don't think anybody
none of them has maybe it's you know one
of
the stop thoughts out there yeah
i don't i don't even know how how to
like practice that
it's like when did you start
noticing that this could be a method
to test the liquid at that point started
with uh i was sizing into a ticker
i was wondering okay well the stock is
up about 100 percent
how much can this adds in
i was pushing size i was making 100k 80k
at the beginning i was making 20k then
80k the 100k on ticker
and it gets to a point that
you size in so much
and it's not worth it no more it's not
worth it for a stock that's only a
hundred percent you'll get your limit
of
the size is not worth it for the stock
right now yeah you have to drop size
because your wrists become too much
so
um
that's number one after that i started
to notice okay
how much size can i use to test the
stock to you to actually
fill my own size
into the pool
before somebody
uses a large amount of dollar to counter
me because i showed it too much
so
it started from there
and i'm still earning i don't think i'm
i am uh
there yet but
i have a feeling
that
not a feeling but i have some type of
statistics behind it it just
it's quantum available but it's very
difficult
yeah it's that sounds really tough
yeah sometimes
i don't know how to do it
and i don't know how to start to
practice that until at first i feel like
i need to get to a certain point in my
account size and um
to actually have an effect
when like save short 50k shares to um to
test the liquidity
um but 50k is like everything to me
right now
on and so at this point you have to
worry about that all you have to focus
on is
patterns right injury right exit
maximum your
maximum minus your pro your percentage
on a chart
at the beginning i was just trying to
practice okay today i missed about ten
percent from the entry i should i should
top take it and i also should bottom
take that there's a statistic statistics
for top tick and volume tick
uh like
whenever your top tick you will know how
how far the stock will drop like every
time i told you that uh it's not exactly
to drop to here
if the volume is too um too much
you know you can cover a little bit
about there all those cover experience
or exiting experience come from
statistics it comes from all those
experiences
so
from from trading once you
at the beginning
i'll say at the first two to three years
if you just practice your entry
and maximize your profit on the exit you
should be good to go yeah that's
once you practice the point
i would say
give a zero to 100 if you got to 90 on a
total score you can make a million
dollars
i have been doing none of that
yeah i need to yeah i need to i actually
can i find a plan
i i actually want to write this down
because
yeah i haven't been tracking
um how good my entry and exit is from
the most ideal point on each dip
each of the different pattern
i haven't been doing that at all
yeah i need to do that right
yeah
um
all right which uh brings us to the next
question
um
this is see
when i'm having an issue in day trading
it's um it's
it's pretty easy for me to like to go to
you and have it fixed i'll go ask you
questions and then you'll point out what
am i doing wrong what am i doing right
um
but you
you kind of you started
trading on your own and then you
pretty much it's a self-learned process
for you and i wonder
it's easy for me to keep myself humble
because i can go to you i can i have
some place to look at but how do you
keep yourself like in check and humbled
and in whatever
in whichever way you would define a good
trader
how do you keep yourself in check
because see that's the hard part i used
to be
uh
i used to trying to figure stuff by
myself now looking at all different
people's stuff
all the bigger traders or bigger name
traders or major creators out there
uh i will test their strategies and
we'll see if they're working now
but from
self-improving part it is so much more
difficult i have to do so many trades
and simulations and to see where could i
fit in and how to dodge losses and how
to have the correct mindset
every time when i take a loss now that's
the hardest part because
if you're alone you're unsure of
what you did wrong what you did right
um
until you trade for maybe 10 months a
year or 10 months
and two a year
and you look at your entire trading
entire
you look at all your trades from your
trading now you look at all your trades
from account statements and you'll be
able to figure out okay this is the
biggest loss i have i probably should
get rid of that one and i should also
look at this sticker
maybe this one is a little bit extra
this is from over trading or this is
from
revenge trading you take those out and
you will be able to recognize which ones
are available which one's not avoidable
you can
you know simulate another sheets and you
can see oh this is you know have much
more better result than i have let's do
that
next time and it just slowly improves
every single year
yeah yeah so that's how yourself
improve
so you pull out your account statements
and then you find out the the consistent
trade and then you put you actually
simulate them and you put those trades
into into a new spreadsheet and then
just the new spreadsheet has nothing but
the ideal trade that you bought ideal
trader you pull up and there's the
losses that you think it's unavoidable
okay then you look at your profits and
they locate profits right now and you
can see oh i [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
up so you actually
build this ideal in your in your head
and then you go for it and then until
you get there you figure out
another idea that you can go for again
and that's the way you
yeah
that sounds tough
i still want to write it down
alright guys that's enough trading in
topics for today so if you have any
questions
or any comments about jimmy and
questions
to ask me leave a comment below and
we'll be happy to answer and hopefully
in 2022 you guys will have a great
training journey and let us know i'll
see you guys in the next one

is a completely gamble $10 depends on
trellises stop it
get some help what's a person in Baxter
welcome to my new video lessons of the
week and today I want to talk about
there's lots of manipulations in the
market and I want to go over some of the
key factors how they do it and according
to my analysis from this market so let's
go over a couple there's many many
things now and to go over a type of x ts
tell GPR so those three tickers are
basically manipulated by the same guy
and he basically bought the entire flow
because of those three tickers are micro
float pupae the entire flow then there's
two 300k naked shorts and they basically
are stepping on each other of this fungi
that have all the shares that's why
although crazy squeezes happened
something like creek the historical
volume trading more volume than used to
and massive supernova comes in then if
you decide to dump all the ships are
lost mounting so all retail traders
parsimony house AG BR and TSL now a
table reacts and I mentioned there's a
couple key factors that especially on
GPR because since it's a micro flow if
the flow start rotating the individual
resistance does not apply to you super
super macro flow if they rotate for ten
times five times it can be really
dangerous for the stock breaks to Paroli
high and GPR do exactly the same thing
and yes there is a volume brought but
that is a chance for this big guys to
set a name into that void blog once the
resistance breaks you can have a massive
short squeeze then you can sail into the
strength so that is the danger of
shooting multiple wrote a floating
stocks and if they're super micro flow
that is one of the factors individual
resistance does not work in this one
specific situations they all do the same
thing I think MTS L did the same method
micro float start flow rotation
break the priority high went all the way
to six and dumped it all the way down
and also dumped it on the deep part
people lost a lot of money on those two
tickers a double X as well they pretend
today a moment in shift into the eighth
dropped to the six at a Friday afternoon
squeezed out with you
$36 as you can see a double X did not
rate that much volume because in the
recent market the regular volumes but
about 20 min to 30 me all the tickers
and double X did not read that much
volume and the panic mowing is not that
big so it is very easy to manipulate
since the balance so low it doesn't take
that much money or it doesn't take that
much shares to buy to break this
resistance zone and that's exactly where
it happened
people are sizing in the crab timing
they know we're short sellers wants to
short and they soak into that volume
then they squeeze them out of the gate a
double x gb are empty SLE took na short
sellers out again I I think I took a
decent gallon gbr I did not catch em TSL
I didn't even try to pretend to dip by
it
nothing's completed a fully manipulation
right WX I think I found shirts too
short butters nothing for me to show
them at least gbr has some kind of
volume or resistance for me to risk of a
table is all super thin volume no
resistance at all just period dumping
peer manipulations and just massive
selling laughy you can't really guess if
you are selling or not because there's
if there's no resistance they don't have
attempted to either sell or hold because
if there is a resistance you'll be
really hard we'll take extra money to
make them money put it to higher highs
but any table legs bobbins it goes to 50
islands it goes to 90 you can really
predict
if there's no resistance zones at all we
can choose not to sell it can choose to
sell so shorting yesterday objects it is
a completely gamble but if you show that
it you're lucky and you won 50 percent
of your entire investment and today
there sounded look secretary keeps
setting off same thing with a Sherman
why it should always do a little bit
different company ran on the morning and
massive time trend and they programmed
you and I reversed wits again keep
setting off but the key is if you see
the consistent downtrend for a while
when you start to squeeze not is become
the massive disasters for short sellers
because we can't but you can't really
find a volume block or any resistance in
the chart yes it might be in the 7 so in
the tens but there's no really a volume
traded look at the volume to the right
here 2.4 million well I don't really
hear nothing if there's no volume that
means there's not much people are
holding in stock which means when the
squeeze happens it's gonna squeeze a lot
higher let me think now same thing
happened on fire and DRL is so be a
shorter don't be too aggressive
once you become too aggressive we get
into that habit that just keep shooting
and keep shooting
then you mentally gonna meet one of the
dough's either a 5 n or DRL is massive
squeeze and took you out it again so if
there's no pattern
don't try even though you know you're
going to win but in a long run you're
practicing bad habits if you have bad
habits in a stock market you will lose
you may eventually lose it doesn't
matter how much money you went but you
can omit that one specific and gonna
lose your money so trade something with
the edge don't trade something based on
luck or based on what do you think
because that doesn't really applies to
South American you feel on to invest
into this game for a long run so that is
my thought process and human wire breaks
and named to yourself also on gbr in my
opinion I think necessity into that
volume block around $3 testing something
the 506 and solely into the 10 so the
thing thing made around five million
dollars on that one specific tongue aw
exit or how much they made I would guess
you start selling you to 15 they're
average probably around save on mowing
block right here line block right here
so three four five so their average
probably around $5 or $6 serving to the
15th yesterday there is not much volume
so probably average so will be around 10
then if they have too many shares the
problem made 10 million dollars over
eight eight to ten million dollars on a
table legs
plus I'm DSL probably they made around
20 million dollars roughly all those
manipulations that is my personal guess
will depends on Farian tomorrow let's
see if my right other than that please
be careful in this market
there's too much manipulation going on
I'm sure this guy will eventually get
caught and personally manipulating a
stock that company has no aware of this
guy manipulating it
so eventually he'll get in trouble but
as a retail trader they are now going to
give your money back so as a retail
trade you have to be extra careful to be
able to survive in this market and I
hope this lesson helps and he made money
great congratulations if your nice
morning take this as a lesson and I'll
be see you guys next video lesson thank
you very much

hello guys steven knox here welcome to
this video i know i haven't done a video
for a long time so today i want to do a
recap video since there's tons of plays
that appear into the market as i noticed
there is a significant volume shifting
into
the normal play that we have like bounce
shore gap up shore and
the overall dollar block
on the multi-day runner so today i'm
going to go over them one by one and let
you know about my discoveries and also
uh how do we move forward especially
with our trading strategies in the next
couple months
so before i start this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
uh we have a conference coming up
in july 15th so this is the last month
for you guys to get registered uh
online for the tickets other than that
let's get into the video all right so
going into aerc uh on the 15th the stock
went up to squeeze all the way up to 23.
uh this is where i was getting
interested into shorting on the second
day
i borrowed some shares still didn't
short on the second day i cracked by the
end of the day and came back again
so
uh
for multi-day runners back in 2021 the
daughter block is around 1 billion to 2
billion total
dollar has to be traded
in one or two days in the same level
but on this chart it was trading 20
million then 9 million and
40 million so 40 million didn't really
form any type of consolidations
uh then 20 million is not enough to form
a dollar block so on this chart was
basically very choppy and
impossible to size into with a decent
size when it's trading with really thin
volume you can see that the spread is
really large
every single
you know 40 000 shares can drop to stock
one or two dollars
a share so it's pretty difficult to
trade uh overall but i would assume that
if the stock holding for you know for
almost two weeks
um
this could generate a massive squeeze
probably up into the 40s and 30s to 40s
and and trading decent amount of volume
before we drop from there
but i do not think that aerc has hit the
top yet and
if it does then we will probably create
really low volume
or offering comes out then we might
see the end of erc for now uh risk
reward is not there and also volume is
really thin so be really careful shortly
into
light volume stocks because squeezes
tends to become
very fast and pretty brutal so as you
can see on june
15th
right about here
all right so another ticket i want to go
over will be sidu so we had two tickers
that generated about short this one
traded over 100 million uh volume on
around four so the date is may 6
right here basics uh
it was a gap off short pushed up about
let's say 10
straight all the way down to three so
whenever you see the consolidation is
around three or two
any price
that's under three is generally pretty
dangerous for
shorting into resistance so i would
prefer much more expensive stocks
other than you know three dollar
per share because of it's really cheap i
didn't short into it i think i took a
really small size around 2.9 once this
came back all the way to 2.9
i cut it even
since it didn't fade so
normally with really cheap stocks heavy
resistance
uh if the stock trades enough volume
will actually break through the
resistance in the current day
so you gapped up in the second day
uh didn't find shares too short found
some shirts too short up in here on june
17th
uh write it down
to
5.5 so i would say that this could drop
a little bit more
but uh when it formed the top it traded
i think 80 miniatures around nine
dollars so the dollar
total is 560 million
and it's not enough compared to 2021 so
if this can come back and break the
nine dollar area again after
drop for another a day or two
we will see another massive
multi day runner
and
as you can see that aerc and sidu has
been popping up you know 700 percent
um on both tickers there's other tickers
that are following those two tickers
so we're slowly seeing that the comeback
of penny stocks
and
the overall volume has significantly
reduced and also the spiking
potential has reduced as well normally
on the second green day it
it goes up back and forth and it goes up
much more than
compared to the open price on the second
green the open price normally doubles
from uh the open price so goes this one
goes to 14 in 2021 but the statistics
has actually changed a lot more so
there's tons of um i would say data to
track and get good with the current
volume stage and that's what i have been
seeing
according to the last two tickers and
couple other plays in the in the last
couple months other than that um a lot
of people want me to talk about the
overall market
general spoi
in terms of technical analysis there's a
lot of rate hikes that's going to come
into the market uh inflation still stays
hot as long as inflation
is persistent
and there's there's going to be a
massive
rate hacks that's going to come in
i would say late 2022 or beginning of
2023.
so i don't see
this one uh comes all the way back to
brick all-time high but there's several
gaps uh
pretty much all the
gaps on spy gets filled
so there's
you know mass amount of gaps between 402
to
395.
so this will probably after it drops a
little bit more i will say it comes back
and fill all those gaps and take another
massive dump again so
that will be my thoughts on uh the
overall market and a lot of people are
saying that if the market is dropping a
lot of people are exiting the stock
market we wouldn't have many plays
or small cap plays in the next few
months i wouldn't say that because uh
when the overall market starts dropping
unemployment rate goes up this is very
similar to the situation compared to
2020 a lot of people got laid off and
everybody start
trading the stock market and that's
where gme
emc dogecoin and dwc all kinds of
tickers going up thousands of percent in
one day
i i believe in the next couple months we
will have a tons of our energy plays uh
indo uh husa all those lower floaters
that's related to oil industry will come
back
and
uh because the technology sector is so
oversold we will
probably have a lot of technology
related stocks spiking up again
and there's going to be tons of
opportunities so
i wouldn't say that the pending stock
market is completely dead there's place
that's slowly coming back
and i would um
i would say encourage you guys to track
all the data
that's being provided to you on aerc and
sidu so you can get a kind of a glimpse
of how it's going to play out in the
next couple months other than that this
will be the recap of this video so
uh as a reminder we have a conference
coming up in july 15th
you guys will have another about 30 days
to register online
um
and that will be under this video thank
you very much for watching i will see
you guys in the next one

how many missing ducks happy knowing
I've turned twenty seven thousand into
almost forming dollars within three
years and today I'm announcing the
pre-sale of the taxpayer guy DVD that we
including the most updated strategies
and all the former nap come up with to
make her entry and exit more accurate in
this DVD I'll be giving really specific
details to help you to be able to trade
in different scenarios when the trade
happens in different situations so in
the general market a lot of people are
really confused which pattern is should
focus on so in this specific guy I'll be
only giving out four or five patterns
that have the highest winning percentage
back in 2018 and 2019 that have made me
almost 1 million dollar throughout the
year and just in within two years
there's a lot of volume and getting to
the market especially in a stat so I'll
be focused on the Nasdaq market there's
also a bunch of details I have to name
four different patterns and those
details will help you to increase your
winning percentage significantly so grab
the supply while it lasts
this first sale will be the lowest price
we can ever be so in this DVD will be
contains all those informations so make
sure review as much as you can and I'm
looking forward to see your results in
the future what's up guys diamond doctor
it's been crazy since last week I think
I made around ninety thousand dollars
almost $9,000 on ppth huge runners that
have created the highest volatility for
some of the tickers some of them went
from two to seventy dollars in three
days some oven just following the hype
on the sympathia play and ppth is the
mean one it basically it did a breakout
on the nine dollar level ish so he went
on last week it wasn't really credible
because the range is a little bit too
big so if you're only really shortened
to resistance you can't really find
number two risk for you can't risk 6 you
can risk 9 and that range is huge so you
can really add into an average into it
once it took at the line level it just
basically went parabolic and people
started showing through this afternoon
down but it was a short rap and you went
all the way to cemani and on this
specific day if you want
Briony sure without any pattern this is
what you are risking love if you don't
have any risk management you can pull up
your account in an hour and when you are
going sure or good mom when you are
going on in the 70 dollar area thinking
is gonna go higher then you're basically
risking 50% of your entire investment
and if you hold even longer and you're
losing about 60% in this penny stock
area it contains a lot of risk but also
contains a lot of return and you need to
really focus on your risk before you
focus on your return as long as you can
control risk you know what you're doing
you know what pattern you're trading and
you know the edge you're trading then
you will be able to profit from those
tickers since this is a really micro
flow and micro flow basically / - your
flow levitation you can do anything
that's why I didn't trade on this day
when it's up when it comes to cemani I
stayed out completely because basically
you're risking you know you're going on
that's when you sore you know you know
12 you need to sell probably into this
parabolic action because the stock might
get T 1 to 12 halted and when it gets
hotter than once the open it basically
drops about 90 to 75%
you wanna candle and you can't really
exit up out of your positions and not is
the problem on Friday you bring up a
bunch of some of the plays I think
everything was out of control it's going
to trade like 100 minimum based on my
own prediction sympathy plays are based
on main trend is not a really a pattern
if the mention dies the Scimitar player
dies as well
he's a mean trend doesn't die then the
more inspect doesn't really make sense
now one of the patterns that 4/10 a
place is most of them to play they
always do like a massive more in spike
so try to tend to stay away after market
opens for 20 minutes try to figure out
what you want to do
I basically stay away from half an hour
to see where the patterns going because
all the simply play everybody wants to
get in everybody wants to get in I think
he's the next V P th same thing with T
and X P and once they once they get in
all the same they play all have one
common reaction if they are getting
chased too hard they drop instantly
about 50% more 90% of its own game and
typically given culture as well so
getting into the back side you don't
need to be hurry
seal inspect for ID five minutes and
look at how much you drop and drop the
50% of an entire warning gap and tuning
speed dropped almost 100% of its mooring
gap no matter how many sympathy play you
trade there always will be the same
reaction if there's more chasers there
will be more trouble so the harder the
spike the harder the pennant case and
back in 2017 to 18 I've been really
trying to perfect my strategies I think
it's getting better and better I can
really well filter out the tickers that
don't want to trade on Friday I think
there's too much going on I won't enjoy
the two tickers and I wasn't be able to
catch cont and XP but I'm not really
regretting that at the beginning of my
career I always think if I miss this
ticker I made so much money and I feel
bad about myself I think you wanna go
bigger into the next one and I think
that is the really wrong mentality to
really want to be consistent powerful in
trading so for the last year or two I've
been really putting together a DVD
called duck Schneider and this DVD will
be included new strategies that and
really help you to be consistent
profitable and all the new strategies
are all updated and involves a lot of
details as you can see in the market
opening cap down he needs a lot of
details to for it to be up to work OTC
brick young doesn't really
not much anymore so that's right it's
kind of out there that I still kinda
exist but it doesn't really happen often
OTC panic did by nothing does not really
work anymore if you track by statistics
it's going to be really really helpful
for people trying to recognize the trend
trying to filter out when there is ten
players on you're screwing and to choose
which one has the highest odds pre-sell
will be releasing on either Sunday or
Monday and the DVD or official release
will be in the mid June or late June the
preacher is going to be running for
multitude so if you don't get the

================================================

Language: en
what's up guys doing duck sir so in this
video I'm going to cover my May
performances and I send out my account
statements I think was a few days ago I
made about two hundred eighty four
thousand and gross profit probably
twenty thousand commissions and fees net
profit will be two hundred sixty
thousand you may 29th and 30th I think I
took two consistent losses of twenty K
each majority are coming from the fees
since there's so many plays and if you
don't really play the ticker but you
still get charged by the fees overall
that's my net performances for this
month today I'm going to cover several
takers that stands out that traded
around 100 million to two hundred
million volume and since those stickers
are really difficult to read I'm going
to give you a couple methods and how to
really spot stuff on level twos and how
to really read potential key points and
how far you can pull back I hope I can
spike they're much more difficult to
read compared to the Roma stuff we've
been trading that trades around twenty
to thirty million that's pretty much all
of the content I'm going to provide
today let's get into the video first so
here is my May account statement overall
I think I did a decent but not perfectly
well personally I think I could do much
better in May and that you can see you
may second my third and made nine to May
10th
I don't really trade that often you only
aim for the perfect setups which I did
but the sizing in and the way I reval
you miss and the entry and exit not
perfectly happy about that so overall
the gross profit can see is two hundred
twenty four thousand I paid about
fourteen thousand uvs closing our range
and the net profit which is close to two
hundred ten thousand and as I said not
perfectly happy about my entry and exit
this is one of the good examples to show
you don't really trade every single day
only wait for the perfect opportunities
you can see the market recently there's
a lot of volume are providing enough
chances for you to really get a good
entry good exit and make a decent lot of
money probably every
three times a week so that'll be my
personal performance in seeing here
here's my constant how will show proof
before I get into the tickers as always
so let's get into the ticker that's
really stand out so these three are the
selected tickers that I chose CET X
trade about two hundred million shares
on that day then ad AP also traded at
tons of volume but have completely
different compared to the Lowepro we
typically trading and here I'm going to
explain what happened and how to really
spa this is not a really sure about
stock and a mrh this one trade also tons
of volume in the pre-market and same on
a volume after market open let's put
them into different category first and
so as I made the video before when you
want to look at different tickers you
want to put them into different market
cap zones ad AP of course fit into the
billion dollar market cap zones when you
are seeing a market cap is over 1
billion dollar it's really hard for them
to provide equalities and there's not
many people trading it because there's
not much volatility going back and forth
if there's not much range were created
from the ticker by itself there's not
many traders are interested to trade
them it's same on a ratio but currently
right now we're getting tons of volume
and it's see you know how the billion
dollar tab performed on that specific
intraday so when you're looking at the
pre market gap up into a billion dollar
cap of course when you're selecting
tickers in two different market cap
zones you have to put them in two
different perspectives so ad ap overall
our five to ten and it pulled back in
the morning now when we're looking at a
gap up short
and when systematically opening straight
dies there's always some type of balance
coming in as long as there's sufficient
enough volume in a pre market now what
do I mean by sufficient amount of volume
pre market so during the pre market if
the voluntary is over in two million we
call that sufficient volume crowded
volume typically trades around over five
million to 10 million and ten million or
plus becomes untreatable in this case ad
AP traded death many more than 2 million
sure
in primary care and provided a decent
mana balance when you're looking at in
terms of resistance in a historical
chart you don't really see any type of
individual resistance or consistent
resistance in this case the chart is
completely fresh the only thing you have
will be the pre-market resistance which
is very light resistance and I see tons
of people showing around 10:00 shooting
around 11:00 risking you know 12 but I
actually pushed above 12 10 by judging
the chart actions we are seeing a tons
of volume with really slow grind it's
moving about maybe 5% every half an hour
of 5% every two hours and that type of
slow grind is very difficult for you too
short or going along it's because when
they start to form a bottom and you
don't really know it's going to panic
it's going to break al and especially
when we are treating on fresh chart so
gap helps your showing into pre market
resistance can be only used before you
live on a clock and you can see you know
people are shooting around 1:00 p.m. and
slow granite all the way up to the
pre-market resistance which is $12 area
and it's way past the perfect time zone
to shorten to you that's why I see a lot
of people are over trading on the
sticker as I said 1 billion dollar cap
and past the perfect trading time zones
also you know there's fresh char no
resistance that's why it's not tradable
three reasons hope you guys can remember
on next time when you are trading know
these type of market caps now for a
following day a lot of people have
probably heard about a bursting gap down
or bursting gap down doesn't really work
on billion dollar cap overstand gap down
only works on small cap dot trades tons
of volume and be up over 200% to 300%
Enosh that's where overstaying gap down
pattern performs the best so now in AD
AP the stock only up about 150 percent
then the next day gapped down 10 to 15
percent first of all obviously a gap
down doesn't really work that well in
building our cab second gap down so low
and you didn't really create enough
range for the shorting - you know when
you are looking at obviously
don't you want to look at different
consolidation zones ad ap consolidated
in anywhere between nine to ten you
don't really know where the resistance
is that's the problem and if you don't
really know the resistance and you are
Brian insuring into the yesterday
clothes that's not going to work out
very well and you can see the squeeze on
ad AP so this is one of the perfect
examples to really identify which
attacker you should trade by selecting
different market caps and selecting
different resistant zooms and all that
Sun has been cleared that's pretty much
all for ad ap let's get into a marriage
and CET X now this to takers are
extremely tricky in terms of intraday
charts and before we get into intraday
let's look at the pre market now pre
market I traded about 13 million shares
thirteen miniatures is extremely high
amount of shares compared to the normal
ticker we've been trading typically the
volumes anywhere between two to three
million Louis will be 500 K 2 1 medium
but we're having a 13 million pre market
so as the Marylebone you got extremely
crowded and we are looking at different
charts and also reading the pattern
itself even though it's about short when
you're looking at in terms of a
resistance volume by checking out a
yearly chart you have a resistance at
three resistance at three so you have
two resistance at three each has about
40 million resistance volume so overall
it has about like a hundred million
resistance in the first hour we already
traded a 50 million so by the volume
estimate it's going to trade much more
or can exceed 100 medium resistance
volume so in that case when you're
looking at you know stock is dropping
and you want to chase into you know
short into a punk short because it's
dropping from the resistance always
think about if they already trade about
15 million volume where's the rest of
all is going to go in the next you know
six to five hours that's where you can
prevent yourself from over trading is
because once you have that bond
instrument you're ahead
50 million volume in the first hour can
already tell you you know do not trade
this ticker the ticket is going to
bounce is going to
you and try to test the resistance again
in this case you can see CTX test a
three dollar multiple times and it
didn't drop that far after market closed
then of course we are offering the next
day make the stock drops at 1.5 but
that's the offering if it didn't really
perform offering you don't know what's
going to happen after 200 million share
day now when we looking at volume in
terms of in the entry day and the next
day before that day let's look into
trader psychology so when we are trading
something that's really crowded and
everybody's trading in and the next day
if it holds it scam you definitely gonna
tell your friends you said hey this
stuff hasn't news I'm body cameras when
you are using or wasting gap down on
this crowded ticker
wait for the next day and you know bond
is going to come in soon so the bank on
being can show into the bounces so
that's something you can really take
advantage of when there is massive
amount of volume in the previous day
that's for CET X as I said if you're
offering so it didn't really produce a
bounce that be my thought process on CET
X overall CTX will definitely be a good
showing to resistance play in the future
there is just way too many takers on
this month and I think I would rather
talk about ABL instead of AMR H so API
ohm when you're looking at you know
micro flow taker in 200 100 million
market cap zones especially when you are
looking at in the morning if the stock
is up about 100 percent and you want to
spoil some shares in the morning
personally I have done this many times
typically you know low flow the Perot is
anywhere between 0.06 to 0.1 and you
want to bro let's say 5,000 10,000
shares you will cost you about 2,000 to
4,000 before people market open so you
don't even know the song is going to
spike or dump at the market open and we
are taking that much loss in the
pre-market just by pouring the fees you
will forces you to make a trade you want
to make that in a borrowed money back
and that type of thinking messes with me
many
times before when I borrowed way too
many shares in the pre-market and I want
to trade that because I want to make the
feedback and you know wasted way too
much power of these and that's where you
start making mistakes now for something
like a bi all that flows between a 1
million to 2 million I don't really
suggest the trader anymore even though
you has a good odds and has some type of
resistance personally not for me anymore
I kind of got tired of them sometimes I
make money I make 90 thousand sometimes
I lose 10,000 in fees without trading
anything sometimes I lose 15,000
complete without trading anything by the
time goes you just add up for a low flow
even though you have an edge I don't
really recommend for you to trade it
until you have a very set up structure
or very good risk management to be able
to control that type of losses
personally for me it's not very ideal so
that's pretty much off the tickers for
today and that probably should cover a
little bit more I'll try to pull out
some of the chart style work to study

[Music]
welcome to this video and today we're
going to talk about some of the plays
that just happened in this month and we
have seen actually some takers that is
really treatable so I'm going to go over
them and I've made some profits into
those trades so uh other than that make
sure to hit the like button and
subscribe let's get into the video so
today we have imrn and xpon those are
the two I would say most profitable
trades in the last couple days and I
also want to include oric as well so uh
those are will be the three tickers I'm
going to talk about and the first one
will be imrn so this one it was not a
three dollar stock it's approaching to
three dollars I was looking to uh short
into this one after a massive push
against the pre-market resistance
uh it turns out that it turns uh it's
trading in terms of volume but it's not
moving up so it's formed the
consolidation around 2.5 I'll show you a
little bit the size is not really that
much since we didn't trade that much
volume so overall only I made about a
couple thousand on this one uh maybe I
think I sized in anywhere 5000 shares so
shares were pretty cheap then we had the
xpon now this one uh is a gap offshore
uh you went up 200 percent or plus uh I
was also looking sure after a morning
open pushes anywhere between 20 to 30
percent uh it turns out that the first
Kindle is way too aggressive I think
just within the first 30 seconds stock
went to from from 3 to 370 and 370 to
2.65 so before I wanted to session
around 3.6 the stock is already around
three so didn't chase it I showed it a
little bit around 315 made about
overall 30k on the sticker not too much
but at least there's something to play
off also you can see that the shares has
dropped massively compared to 2021.
typically a 200 Runner you are likely to
see anywhere between I would say 100
million to 200 million volume uh in the
in our entry Day level but right now
you're only getting 50 million volume so
the volume has dropped significantly
about 50 percent but the pattern is also
right and also the consolidation time
has been significantly reduced compared
to 2021 so the fading percentage are
still looks about right if the ticker is
really close to two dollars and the
failing percentage gets affected by the
stock price if the stock is too cheap
that means
shareholders can buy more shares with
their account and since it's a low flow
so it's not going to face and a five
percent from the top especially whenever
you see a ticker price it's just a
little bit above two dollars so there's
something that you want to pay attention
to if you are shorting a ticker that's
around three dollars especially on the
entry level the failing percentage will
get affected by the current stock price
the closer they're going to approach on
the two dollar level that means the
stock is unlikely to fade in the
upcoming days we're in the upcoming um
afternoon
so that'll be for uh xpon then we have
oric this is the ticker that happened
yesterday which is uh Thursday same
pattern
after our runner came back down then
come back up test the pre-market
resistance this is only up about 50
percent as you can see that on biotech's
particular holds
way better compared to a ticker that is
not about tech so the chart two charts
looks very similar one it's more
expensive when it's not uh pretty much
after I run up come back down test the
pre-market resistance again consolidate
and break down you can see or I see even
though it's more expensive that means I
trapped more backloaders into this push
but I didn't fade all the way down so
you can see the difference between
technology sector and biotech sector
because the risk reward and statistics
is completely different
uh compared to other sectors also
biotech is pretty much not treatable
majority of the time their float and
market cap are above 40 million and 300
million so the bigger the market cap is
and the better the fundamental of the
stock will be not including the meme
stocks those are the tickers that
happened last week then I want to also
go over some of the potential play into
the next week this is
htgm that happened uh I think was two
days ago and he did a reverse split so I
want to make a video about reverse play
specifically in the future but
you can see that it closed around three
so up about six up about 100 when the
stock to the does reverse split
historical resistance pretty much get
all all gets canceled and you cannot use
the historical support or resistance so
uh make sure your chart is adjusted to
the split level and when it does a split
it reduces market cap and also reduces
its float that means it change uh its
float make it a micro float easier to
pump I want to say pump up again then
they do an offering increase the flow
then they do the same thing they reverse
splits again and they just
rise and repeat so those are the reverse
player method but I think htgm will have
some potential upside into the next week
and hopefully you can produce a decent
opportunities the flow is relatively low
so you have to be really careful but for
Nano float stocks always wait at least
one day so a first Green Day always
avoid that
if the volume is building from the
bottom since these step takers are very
difficult to manage your risk and hard
to trade so that'll be pretty much all
for this recap if you do have any
questions please leave a comment below
other than that thank you very much for
watching I will see you guys in the next
one

SOURCE VIDEO: Ending July with $160K trading Profit. (Dux's July Stock Recap) [UWL0_Ozad9w].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let's go guys doing that sir welcome to
the new YouTube video of the week today
it's gonna be a monthly recap overall
compared to last month or two and in
July I think I did pretty well overall
the 153,000 plus the fees net profit was
153 overall gross is around 160,000 so
if you look back in July
back in June only did 40,000 and you
look back in July idea 100 rookie right
now it's 153 so overall during the
summer especially in April May and June
those are very slow mount compared to
2016 2017 18 also always in summer
everything are very very slow but the
market starts to come back there in July
so July August September then start
getting hotter October November December
those are the three hottest month
overall the year so let's talk about
some a particular trade most of the
trades are very small games on the only
big trades that I did those vis L and
CEI other than that it's pretty much all
pattern bound short gap offshore 1st
birthday over second cap down by Ernst
efficiencies and dollar prop so those
are all patterns is included in the DVD
and I'm gonna talk about some of the
patterns let's get into it
now let's go over some of the CEO and
gay so this was a very classic low flow
pump we went from 1 to 8
and I showed it I think to the
consortium breakdown since the moment in
shift
I should have swing it but the power fee
was a little bit too expensive I threw
my swing it to the end so I showed it
around 650 now into this conception
break down once they broke down add a
little bit into this balance and keep
fading went all the way to the $2 area I
think on this day the stock already
dropped is 75% of its own gain so I was
thinking nice now worth it
to really hold overnight pain like
15,000 borrow fees and the next day I
think get your offering
I should have a whole
but I can't really predict offering so I
just let that one go now let's talk
about other ticker the stickers called
CGI and they also very little flown
under 1 million and now it's doing toxic
financing and yeah it's under 50 cents
now I think the way I treated it was
around nine dollar area to that spike I
didn't really shortage I think I took a
partial position 540 area using the
bounce shore not that much not very
relevant see I was not the pattern can
really trade to because if you take a
look at the intraday chart so did a gap
up week open big tapered pattern broke
this five-dollar area went all the way
to nine and in this specific char you
don't really see a consolidation
resistance and don't really see
overstaying gap down because when you
want to use of a same gap down you want
to pick a consolidation area to
reassuring to you and in this chart it's
all parabolic there's no volume was
actually traded in one specific area so
when you are using overseen gap down I'm
sure into six star area then the risk
will be huge because there's no
resistance and it also didn't really
push enough so you all really wanna risk
950 area then you're asking about twenty
to thirty percent and the downsides not
that much now let's talk about some of
the ticker today DPW to the reverse
split an Eevee er was a gap up a lot of
people are asking me about opinion you
ve are let's go ahead and talk about
market at first first there is specific
categories into all different Murray
Capstone's
typically put in stocks are around 10 to
100 million noodlebib
median cap will be around 100 to 500
million larger cap will be 1 billion
moreover now this is considered to be a
mid cap since it's really really low
volume most of the volume that we
typically encounter is tuning meeting
our above intraday wise sometimes it'll
be 15 or 10 million but nothing under 10
million and when we use volume
production by the pre market volume most
of the time by 12 let's say most of the
time by 12 o'clock in the midday
has already traded about 10 million
volume already or 7 or 8 million at
least
and this checker was only traded about 2
million volume 9 and 2 million and it's
doing its consolidation so when there's
low liquidity and super big cap it's
very difficult to you but go long or
short because first you will affect the
price a lot second lowly query also
indicates very large spread so you're
gonna get a really bad execution and
you're gonna come out either low profit
or loss overall I did pretty good in
July I think I should get some more
players in August since the markets
getting harder and harder but overall
market is dropping I think now a lot of
people ask me about how does overall
market has a correlation with the
current market our intraday there's I
think there's going and I think there's
only one specific criteria the overall
market can be related to the premise
that area is when the stock is dropping
huge especially overall market and
dropping on Baltic 3% or 4% 5% in your
day then you will affect the quality in
penny stocks let's say the stock is up
about 70 percent in the pre market and
when people look at the overall market
this thing do you have a correlation
going into the penny stock and it's not
gonna get that much volume when the
penny stock doesn't gain that much
volume the stock is very likely to drop
because once there's no liquid except
opening stocks then the fundamental
doesn't really support green socks then
the stock is gonna drop another 50% and
70% in one day so one of the factor can
remember is when the overall market is
dropping huge the penny stock area
pretty much overall market has really
load QWERTY because people are scared to
go in into a ticker but other than that
I don't think putting stock had any
correlation with overall market
especially some tickers are around I'd
say under 10 million market cap well
become first coming up in the next week
around 17 18 and 19 we have three day to
day lectures I want a live trading if

SOURCE VIDEO: Entry Level Stats Tracking (Statistics 101). [3BFwsqKzKvs].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let's go guys Steven duck sure I did get
a lot of requests from you guys that I
had sure to go over a statistics 101 for
you guys so if you have no idea about
how to really track in statistics how to
really start from scratch I have built a
very simple expressions for you to
really find the correct edge in the
market and to help you be profitable in
the long term so overall I'm not going
to give all those data away but I'm
going to show you a template how to
really track it it's because when you
manually put in those data in you will
have that photographic memories that you
remembered to putting all those data in
we are trading in real time you will
find out that
okay well this set up is the data that I
put in two months ago then you have that
memory of how the chart has developed
through that day then you can use that
behavior to really help you to make the
decisions in lab trading you can't
really memorize all those data in there
but if you tap them in manually you will
have some type of memory and if you go
over again them again you will have more
memories about level twos how did the
market really react in the specific
sectors how much percentage did a spike
on this in the morning so a lot of
factors are involved in and it's very
helpful for you to really build your own
spreadsheets and tap your own data is in
you should help you memorize chart
patterns very well so this is the
general template that I built for you
guys that you have come pretty no idea
about how to really use in spreadsheets
and how to really track it I'm going to
explain each con so they what they
happen because typically with that we
split sectors into different time
periods most of the hot season that does
involve a lot of place is anywhere
between October to December as you can
see that we had a lot of play in October
already at least 20 tickers to tracking
day is to help you okay so anywhere
between January to March and March to
August August to October October to
December you can split all those seasons
this is where this specific set up
happens the most I need to focus on this
specific set up so when it comes up in
this time period let's say in October
obviously in Gap that happens most often
then I will be focused on bursting gap
down and I will be looking at all those
pressures I tried from
previous year to really find out okay so
this is the time zone I need to really
be careful with the exit and to be
careful with the entries and not stuff
like that so that's where dates and
tickers it's the ticker name that's very
simple
so sectors sectors is where a lot of
people are really missing so we have bio
tags we have energy sectors those two
sectors are the harvest into tray that
biotech our interceptor remember that
and then we have a tech sectors and we
have all types of sectors especially we
are tracking energies and biotech you
will find out that energy plays and
biotech play sometimes performs a very
unique way when you are really using a
specific pattern into those sectors
sometimes it doesn't really work that
well so the reason that track sectors is
to be able to find out which sector I
need to stay away then follow up with
index index is either check Nasdaq and
your exchange OTC market the Pink Sheets
so when you are tracking index now let's
explain that what's the difference
between your Exchange and Nasdaq OTC and
the Pink Sheets so New York exchange
typically have much higher market cap
compared with Nasdaq market so most
small caps are always involved in Nasdaq
then photo op OTC is which is trading
really at all the qualities is because
OTC market is really difficult to get to
entry you want to read it takes about
two or three minutes to be able to
execute it in
I don't really we come in for beginners
but if you are tracking statistics you
should know TC is really difficult to
find entry and exit and really hard to
get executed
now then we follow with setups what
pattern is it and whatever you want to
call it you can call a breakout patter
and break down patterns what we want to
call it so we are looking back in the
spreadsheet so you can pull out all the
setups setting them up individually to
really find a better edge in those
detailed setups now follow with
outstanding shares flow and all
strangers to be other ten sometimes
there's more institutional owners so
there will be something involved but
it's good thing to track it pro is the
most important thing is because I
separate flow into different zones to
meaning above considered as a low flow
so for the highest percentage runner
typically happens in the low flow and
micro flow so that's why I track the
flow
I can also pour the data out to really
figure out how to really go along into
this specific flow now we have the
volume previous close and open and top
tick and volunteer so with that and
daily volume is the overall volume
traded per day where did it open how
high do you spike what's the category of
the top tick so the category is which
pattern you're using and the top take
will be on this specific pattern were
kind of top ticked then you can use that
to compare with your current entry let's
say this pattern top tick is $5 you only
did four point two this time so next
time you should improve your entries you
try to get that five daughter as your
many of entry
now follow with this you don't really
need to crack all that day low because
in for beginners don't really need this
this is where you once you finish all
your spreadsheets you want to improve
your maximum way and improve your
maximum asses so this one's more
advanced if you are very deep into
spreadsheets and after that the major
thing that you teach at is pre market
volume free market balance typically the
thing I use for estimating in fact
entirely volume there's a specific
formula for it once you know the
pre-market bond you can kind of tell how
much one is going to trade entire day
and you can use that estimate long to
really find out how many times the flow
is going to rotate if that flow rotate
this amount of time does it mean this
that's going to get bullish or bearish
or it's going to get crowded or it's
going to keep fading by the end of the
day so that is the general template for
tracking data and you can really copy
paste this into your spreadsheets the
following step I will do like a
statistics 102 once you find the edge
that you want to track you want to go
long you want to go short then I would
give you a really specific details about
how to really maximize your again how to
really maximum your losses and last I
found out a lot of people are missing
one very important step about tracking
spreadsheets is because we are tracking
specific market caps
let's say we're tracking 10 meaning 15
million market cap and 10 million to 30
million the level to and the action is
to be different compared to the market
cap is 1 billion or two billion so if a
15 million investment gets pulled into
this 15 million market cap the stock is
going to spike a hundred percent but if
you're pouring 50 million into your one
meal what billion dollar boundary cap is
not going to spike at all we are
tracking specific pattern you need to
segregate all these type of market cap
zones let's say anywhere between 10 to
50 million 30 million 200 million 100
million 200 million that's how you
really find the best edge in the small
cat because different market cap do have
different reactions so that'll be all

confusions you can ask any questions

we're selling like people cheap stocks
and using the spread basically on the
bill and asked to serve them higher than
the normal price so that's how they make
the Commission's but this is a little
bit different
no we trade on pretty stone actions we
don't need to know about companies
fundamentals right so basically you can
see here it was 400 hours four thousand
one to four thousand so what does happen
let's give a really simple examples like
Bitcoin a lot of people like to invest
in Bitcoin last year and they like to we
are thinking okay so I'm gonna invest in
Bitcoin related stocks so maybe stars
can go higher yeah but they don't know
about the company fundamentals they
don't know about their how much money
they need or what's around investments
and it turns out the last month because
the company tried to raise money all
those investors they are they don't know
what they're doing
so basically Lalaloopsy invest into this
not a lot of lubes yeah and we know they
don't understand how the market works
and you can basically take advantage of
that I see I see observe other people
around the world don't know that
interesting okay so you are paying
attention to to the noobs that are like
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up basically yeah that was one
of the nukes - right how long you been
doing this for you know three years
three years okay okay okay so continue
continue take the noobs ER or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
and then and then you step in I when I
step in and I
I can understand okay this stock is
overextended and it's doing like the
behaviors not normal and I can clearly
see it sucks up too much and company
we're looking at okay
our stock is up too much so this is the
time we do the offering that we can
raise money for a company when I know
their company their intentions uh-huh
I can mean two words to the company
inside because I know what they're going
to do okay and they instead of got my
buying there shorted it if I shorted it
so now he's going to show up the box
which means the Bennett games then start
off the massively because when they
raise money it's eye drops about 50% all
right so instant make fifty percent
return one day it's 50% and that's crazy
bro
okay so how did you how did you figure
out this whole strategy you get simple
psychology mm-hmm you bought now you
don't know about the stock market
you bought a ring of stock okay Lisa oh
yeah five dollars okay I dropped that
one you're really upset you don't want
to sell because you're thinking okay no
stuff maybe might come back one day yeah
now the next time when stock goes up to
five so I don't want to be in the stock
anymore I'm stuck in too long I want
your sell kind of even them down then I
can exactly when you play your
psychology to short sale at five because
of your sale would cause a selling
pressure right okay so to talk about
drop a lot of people thinking the same
way than when I showed it massive odds
means two words to my side oh okay okay
okay so since every everybody's like
panicking and like selling at the same
time and then you could like take
advantage of it yeah because crazy man
because like what everything you're
saying right now I'm like I get it I'm
like yeah and then like tomorrow and we
like what was he talking about forget
everything
Steven ducks what's up man hello turn
seventeen thousand twenty seven dollars
twenty seven thousand into 1.7 million
three million dollars theme in dollars
here Steven ducks you turn 27 thousand
into three million
you did all that from playing the stock
market yeah yep instead of merging all
right so how did you get into this role
like to tell us your story okay so
there's one time one day and when I was
19 years old I was really frustrated
about my life I was looking to the
Instagram so give it with Lambos and
covers that are fake bro yeah yeah yeah
but like at that time I actually
believed it so I was like how do they do
this one is really state no one is a
stock market and the one is singer I can
obviously I can sing you can be a kpop
star though you know yeah probably yeah
so like we really say like it has to do
a lot of just a license to a magnet it
wasn't good at that time so I just give
that out you just want Instagram and
you're like yo everybody has nice cars
how am I gonna make some money and
you're like I'm gonna research the stock
market or just get into it
you got a research couple like look at
the YouTube what kind of like industry
make money
Wow yeah okay so where you from tell the
people where you from I'm from China
Chongqing China in the middle of the
China and then how old were you when you
came over here Oh 16 yeah but what were
you doing before you started doing the
stock market stuff like before you got
on Instagram and you're like oh I need
some money
what were you doing were you working I
don't really know what to do because
like I can't even get a job people
looking at me like you don't have my
bachelor's degree oh you don't even have
a master's degree
oh yeah did you go to college yes I did
the but when I was in college are trying
to find a job in campus alright right
we're in it okay so when did you first
realize that playing the stock market
was was gonna work out for you like when
did you realize oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I I know what
I'm doing and this is gonna be good for
me I think was the first couple miles I
was trying to buy this buy that no idea
what I'm doing okay so but I figure it
out okay ETFs is more balancing more
volatile and the bouncing back and forth
and just buy and there's one day I made
like that's not bad and the next day I
lost 500 so how many think okay what
what I supposed to do and because I want
to make it consistent first I think
staff Myers is more like aggressive
income they come man there's sometimes
we can make a lot of money sometimes you
can't make money at all now I filter out
all the Amazons Google's and stuff
because they don't move that much
I have small amount of money so I wanna
make it as fast as possible yeah
so basically there's more risky sector
that we call penny stock penny stocks
it's not pretty stuck single for Wall
Street right okay it's more like in
small cap stocks or big cap stocks so
the companies are based on 195 on
comedian sometime ranging there and
their price are sometimes ten dollars
sometimes five dollars and they have a
huge volatile and also they involve it
off pipes and stuff to go to thousand
percent a day they don't presume the day
so now at first I think like a lottery
thing that I can if I can catch one that
would be rich yeah I think their luck
yeah I think it's love but not every
time I go in to go to the exact opposite
way hmm I tried to do some research and
figure on my patterns creating
strategies and nice to play a game cost
I kept - it's really it's a really
competitive game I think it's the
hardest game yeah and you have to think
about okay what they're thinking
I have to scale what they're doing to
make a counter strategy so you got your
strategy from playing video games is
everything yeah because I wanna I have
the same mindset I want to counter while
they're doing mmm so - Boop - you win
yeah it's like I'm super competitive so
I got that based on the games that got
the statistics based on engineering
which is wrong back test everything then
just combine those strategies together
you teach people how to do it right
attitudes people do it yeah how do you
how do you how do you teach like what do
you where do people go to get to get
taught by you I have a program that
people have to apply first okay
and Stephen duck sitcom Stephen duck see
calm yeah thanks so these are all like
online people go online and they like
Google online yeah sometimes I go try to
have a teaching person yeah so do you
have more girls like sliding in your DMS
now like you're read a couple maybe yeah
like teach me how to play stock Stephen
there's something there's something
there's like roofies yeah sure there's a
lot of stock groupies that's crazy I
always feel like you know it's almost
like your ear you're gambling like I
have no idea how to how to how to do
that stuff I see something I'm like okay
if I also play the stock market I've
like I I think I'm gonna bid on this and
see what happens you feel me I feel like
that's how a lot of people look at it
yeah I think the first time I would look
at a stock market a lot of people
especially our parents said don't play
the stock market as the very dangerous
people look at the movies it's like a
scam but in modern days there's
youtubers there is more stock market
people and there's more industry being
coming into the new reached a new age
you figure out a strategy and you build
ten ten thousand samples let's say can
figure it out
what's the winning percentage of these
specific strategies now if you put a
specific money into it and try to
calculate let's say you went eight times
and lose good times and you do this
repeatedly for a year this is how much
money I'm going to make mm-hmm repeating
strategy and I don't have stress you
don't you are taking less risk because
you know exactly what's going to happen
and you know what's you know if the
stock goes unexpectedly but you know
where you should cut your losses then
that's not gamble anymore
you know everything it's not gamble
right when you said that it made me
think of what whenever people look at
what I do
as like being in the entertainment
industry right they always tell me like
oh like how does it feel to like you're
living a dream you know I'm saying yeah
and I never I never looked at it like a
dream I looked at it like I would look
like is someone trying to be a doctor
you know I'm saying like if you know you
got a doctor you have a goal you just
you you you know you take these classes
you go we'd be nurse you go to you know
take biology you do whatever whatever
you look at it like it's something real
you know I'm saying it was like for you
it's like people look at it like it's
gambling but really you just took a more
realistic strategic approach to it and
you made it successful you know yeah and
the longer you do then it's like you're
doing a sports to not really do the
better you are yeah practice makes
perfect

what's up guide this Steven that today
I'm gonna talk about my tier two content
and also my tier 2 monthly report and if
you're going to subscribe this is your
chance and would be giving now coupon
code for a yearly subscription and if
you subscribe nearly will be also giving
you a yearly report and it's get into it
so first thing I want to talk about is
trader psychology so experienced traders
compared to newbie traders experienced
traders have more experience of course
and they see the specific specific
patterns for so many times and they know
what exactly this pattern will behave
into the next time by newly traders
they're going in and going out they
don't know what's going on and they lose
money so all the experiments are based
on how many times they happened and also
based on the statistics and in here
we'll be listing all my a strategy in my
DVD and we'll be tracking the day in and
day out which ticket is it and overall
we'll be calculating what does winning
percentage of this specific pattern and
what's the profit loss was the equity
curve and what time of the frame and
what time what time frame of this
pattern happens really recently so let's
say you now get Spanish what happens
where it's really hot or let's say in
March of extreme cap down it's really
hot so in this data will give you
general idea what time friend this
pattern would be really hot and what's
the winning percentage behind it and
this this data will help you narrow down
what you need to be focused on what you
don't need to be I think this is the
first putting stock sistex ever and I
think this can be really helpful for new
traders and people who are trading in
six months or a year they and they are
over trade
or they don't know what they're trading
this will help you be a lot more
successful than your turn they are so so
right here on top of the list
I'm sure repair puncture twisting cap
down those are all the patterns I talk
about in my DVD and if you haven't
purchased the DVD you need to know you
have your purchase that you know all
those patterns criteria and for
purchasing to to so I left the size the
ticker what acre is it daily and dad out
and price to impress L of course really
easy to understand and why did I profit
on until I'm a-tellin make money or did
I lose mine and right here it's when I
lost so right here is this pattern
winning percentage so this pattern
performed really well bum sure it's over
eighty three percent winning percentage
equity curve looks really really good
and profit of course very good and if
you took a look at pair bucks short
just reading didn't perform as good as
Bob short but these so many percent 60
percent and same particular dating that
out pricing per cell and I could curb so
I haven't uploaded all my data yet and
it will be upload it will be uploading
everything in the next few days and will
be only open the coupon code for two
weeks so this is your chance and if you
have a question about our monthly report
because when you subscribe to 302 we'll
be giving you all the statistics on a
patterns I'll be also giving your
monthly report so this is really
detailed statistics analysis company
stocks and first will be
analysis in sorry about that so first
we'll be going over all the details
about this eight patterns will be also
adding strategies into all these
patterns so it's not going to be a
strategy it's going to be more
strategies but all those charts are
still in
we're still testing the strategies so if
you wanna test it now you can and it
will be giving you statistics about
those strategies as well and for those
detailed reports you'll be also be
really cleared of where'd you take your
profits let's say I'm short what it's
the average percentage they come down so
if you short if you're shorting this
stock
they typically comes down let's say
fifteen percent or 70 percent or 20
percent so if you find that average then
it's gonna be really good for you you
know words were to take your profit
because that's the average puncture
decline percentage so each patterns will
have where you need to take your apophis
what's the average profit taking so that
will increase your profits and maximum
your profits minimize your assets so
will be also talking about the most
recent runner behavior and all those
behaviors on each patterns what
sometimes they're really weird so happy
web to be more careful with this kind of
situations and will be also listed at in
our monthly report and will be also
talking about massive volume change in
ratio because it's more and more people
come into this penny stock area or penny
stock sector resistance range will be
changing throughout the time happy noise
days from 2016 because in 2016 and this
very solid resistance range I think was
four million and to ten million now it
now in 2017 becomes ten million to 20
million and into the eighteen becomes 30
min to 40 million so as you can notice
as the year changing I'm where more
people coming into the plane stock area
heavy resistance range
throughout the time so we'll be adding
and what time when when the volume is
changing and why you need to be focused
on weight be careful with and if you
subscribe the yearly it would be also
giving you a yearly report so it have a
a general idea of what's going on this
year while pattern is what pattern is
most successful in this year and as the
time goes you have a general idea while
you need be trading and how do you
become a successful trader
so that's what all tier 2 is about and
I'm very excited to see what's the
outcome of this and also that maybe talk
about a XO went on Friday and people
have some questions about a XO on so
massive massive volume traded for past
two days those heavy volume traded
stocks happen really recently so I'm not
sure I just I'm not sure the heavy
resistance in falling ratio is changing
but looks like every single stop heavy
Randy is is trading around 60 million 70
million shares or a hundred 120 million
shares so excellent
I'm not rushed shorting this because I
showed them Friday into that push and
seems like I still have some kind of
strength I'm just gonna wait it out
until this stock comes down to your like
$3 or 2.5 and later on when they bounce
they can have a tough time coming up
because there's a hundred medium
resistance up around this five dollar
area so guys don't over trade it's all
about waiting for the right
opportunities think about there's so
many opportunity the stock market and
you just only need it you just only need
to catch 5% of it
then you can make millions of dollars so
trading in the stock market traded as a
courier not make not getting rich quick
so I see a lot of people as they talk
about people making money on Twitter and
when you see other people making money
on Twitter you have a kind of peer
pressure and you go into stock market
over trade and make you some stupid
decisions and lose money and that's just
deep that just taking yourself a hole to
jump into so please be patient wait for
the web opportunities and if you're
interesting our tier 2 content I will
put a link underneath underneath the
video and it will be also giving you a
coupon code underneath the video as well
and it will be only lasting for two
weeks so that'll be it for today thank
you very much and you guys have a great
day

another one is
mrrn this is not a health care stock it
looked like it's Health Care stock but
it's a consumer discretionary so
basically I said to myself that I don't
trade botch but this one was not a botch
it's actually a regular Gap up short so
had a 3 minute float 20% pushing
percentage this is just a regular Gap up
short didn't fade 75% from the top only
fed 50% since it's IPO so that's a
pretty St Ed pattern to trade so those
are the four takers that I traded
through this month billion dollar rket
cap I seem like the dollar block is
around 1.7 to2 billion not very ideal
but small profits is okay to be made

the other trade that I made was GDC so
this one had a 3D run the only thing
that I don't really like is it had a
massive pullback in the pre-market
including after market open then you
tested the pre-market High it actually
Consolidated and held it skin through
end of the day the test into the
pre-market resistance was solid as well
he had the pull back as soon as it tends
to recover uh you will have to exit it's
not really wise to hold overnight you
can see you when all the way the 12
going to the next day had about 50%
pullback which is not really predictable
had a bounce from the 6ish area so GDC
seems very manipulated doesn't look like
a natural developed chart typically when
you see there's not sufficient volume
high flow tiers tends to slow grind a
lot

for gme it had a crash uh in the midday
but I saw that there is a bunch of
support that was formed the day before
so which is on the May 13th so there is
a massive consolidations before the
breakout around 30 so I knew that the
neutralized area will be stating around
30 as you can see that the chart fade
all the way back down to 36 and formed
the massive support that's where I
covered my positions around 30 I think
it was around 36 is I resorted it around
4 covering the pull back and they did
not touch it for the rest of the day

all right so the another interesting one
will have Gs IW the last time I remember
it was L did uh basically Insider
selling uh selling going down 99% this
one is a little bit difficult to catch
uh it's formed the over gap down pattern
in gap down from the previous day then
didn't even try to push he tra traded 70
minute shares previous day then just
keep going down and there's personally I
think there's no way to size into this
because um each candle on 2in charart
candle and you only traded 250k shares
that's the highest one of course if you
size in you want to consider where your
risk is there's no such thing as a risk
because pretty Market bonds pretty low
and previously close it's a parabolic
squeeze so there's no actual
consolidations for it to risk

typically when you see Gap up the stock
has already formed the bottom and I
downsized actually while it's going down
so I didn't make any profits going to
next day and I was trying to di buying
the 35ish but you can see Consolidated
for the entire day so I exited that

whatever guys to inductor so in this
video I'm going to show you what have I
been through since the first year and
how do you already manage my risk at the
very beginning of my trading career and
this video is going to be a little bit
more numbered and just make sure that
pay attention to I'm saying I don't have
like a board I can draw so I can pull
the numbers right here and you can
basically generally do your calculations
let's get started so a lot of people
have a small count let's assume because
I did a server before let's assume a
starting on count has three thousand and
four three thousand dollar account you
don't have that much opportunities to
really screw up if you screw up you're
done so a lot of people wants to start
with a small account and you're a
college students or you don't have that
much funds to really invest in stock
market then this is your video to watch
before we get into video make sure to
hit the like button make sure to leave a
comment below even questions is getting
to it so starting at three thousand
dollar account typically what I do for
portray there will be five doubt
typically while I do on risk wise is 5%
to 7% per trade so if I invest or if I
decided to short the stock or long the
stock with $3,000 or my whole accounts
and I'm risking five to seven percent so
the risk will be around $150 to $210 now
a lot of people think oh you're just all
in your account but when you are trading
that little small count you have to kind
of go 50% or 75% of your entire account
now before we get into that you're going
all-in and you don't really how to
manage your risk let me give you how to
really manage all that risk plus with
the pattern winning percentage now back
to the start at $150 to $210 will be
your risk or total and in this case a
lot of beginners when are trying to get
in the stock market
they they're focusing into multiple
strategies a lot of strategies it's good
if we all really know what they're
supposed to do but as a beginner you
don't really have that much simples to
have data item statistics to support you
to have any samples to back test and
you're just going because people said
it's gonna be a good pattern
and you're supposed to go long here is
multi-tape retail now the very good
examples that I had is when people say
buy a good breakout he's supposed to
have a really good winning percentage
but when I trapped 200 samples
altogether the breakout he always turns
in to fake out the chances of turning
into a fake cow is about 60 to 70% so
basically you are buying a breakout
within a 30% winning percentage now back
into the samples so once you figure out
okay well this is the maximum loss I
want to lose because before it going to
the mark you're going to any type of
patterns you have to think about what is
your maximum dollar loss it's because if
you can't afford to lose this much don't
ever place trades that make you
uncomfortable so this is number one rule
you just stick with number two general
statistics I know a lot of people have a
question about how to really track
statistics how what's the detail about
it I will do a video about how to really
track general patterns 101 for the next
video so make sure turning to the next
video now for broad wise general
statistic is you want to track the
pattern winning percentage let's say I
want to track the specific actions how
many times they happen which is the
frequency of the ear because when I'm
aiming to your strategy I want to know
what's my maximum risk reward or what is
my average reward what is how many times
did it happen per ear so in that case I
can simulate all types of gains or the
minimum gain per year the largest gain
per year so I would know how much money
I can make by using a $3,000 account
now when percentage is also very
important because from the last video I
did have a three twenty five thousand
dollar counts to prevent that if the
pattern did 10 times losses in a row
because there's a chance that if the
stock has a 90 percent winning
percentage there's a still a chance you
can lose 20 times in a row always trying
to focus on the best winning percentage
when you just start on the first year of
trading is because you don't have that
much chances to really screw up so
growing your first initial count I will
say it's the hardest to do compared to
you have a bigger account now once you
find the pattern frequency once you find
the pattern reward
can use your general statistics to
really know okay so let's say I make
this trade I risk about $150 and made
about 450 bucks then I will have a three
thousand four hundred fifty dollar
account so in the next time I can start
to size a little bit bigger because I
know this is a really high winning
percentage pattern so in that case when
you your account grows into a ten
thousand twenty thousand dollar account
and for me I don't really go all in that
much anymore because with the three
thousand dollar can kind of have to do
like 75% equities and fifty percent
equity but we grow into something ten
thousand twenty thousand there your
money starts to really show up let's say
we have a $10,000 account you're using
they said thirty percent equity you can
make about five hundred bucks and eight
hundred bucks per day that's considered
to be really good and when you grow into
X thirty thousand dollar account and
fifty thousand dollar count the less
equity you will need to use portrayed
that means you can spread your account
into multiple different accounts to
really protect yourself from all those
losing streaks number three we're all
humans very emotional and we're gonna
make mistakes so we're gonna make a
larger tray we're gonna make bad trades
I will say you can't really prevent that
you can't not make any mistakes at very
beginning I will suggest you to study as
much as possible to gain as much data as
possible before you really using real
money into the trading world so number
one backtester strategy number two
manage risk number three try to endure
as much to really prevent you making
mistakes now be here for this video make
sure leave a comment below if you have
any questions I will do a video about
general statistics 101 for people that
just got into statistics and wants to
know work to track how to track the day
hi Taillow how do you really know where
is the maximum award and with words the
maximum risk also leave a comment below
about idea what should I do in the next
video and let's wrap it up thank you for
watching I will see you guys next video

it's gonna be hard for you to edit bro
let's go guys Steven Dexter so in this
video we're going to talk about this
weekly recap and overall I do see a lot
of naughty Gabriel and with really high
volume for you guys beginners you guys
want to focus on one or two patterns
which is a break Alec does have the
highest winning percentage also high
reward it's getting to these type of
details to help you make your decisions
on either going along or short I select
about three takers to go over so let's
get into the video so in here I'm going
to select two different types of
material first one will be you ABS
second one will be V xrt and these type
of materials are completely different
but they do look very similar so let's
get into a little bit details and trying
to figure out when should you go along
and when you go ashore so first of all
is trying to compare two different year
rechart 4 v XR t you can see you perform
the multi-day breakout right about
february 26 and you doubled from the
breakout level went from 1.8 to 3.5 and
for you guys to take a note when you
track your spreadsheets always track the
maximum reward for multi-day breakout
when they try to you so windows trying
to figure out when should you go long
always trying to track the maximum
perform rate for multi-day breakout so
in this case VX RT went from one point a
to 3 point 6 so you gained about 100%
from the pre-k level for you ABS so for
you abs same thing record the pre-k
level one point six nine inspected all
the way to 5 now in this case you want
to track into the spreadsheets because
for these type of volume 100 million
almost 188 million and these type of
volume are exceeding the average value
nitrates in general smoked ham market so
you have to put you abs into different
session compared to VX RT and also one
of the other thing you wanna track is
when the stock did perform one multi-day
breakout does it have a no
chance to perform the second which they
break out in my statistics they don't
really perform the second breakout that
well so we can write here much of the
breakout as first multi-day breakout
second will be right about here in the
middle attempted to break this 3.5 about
two times and failed pretty hard almost
dropped 50% from the high so when the
star tends to break at the highest level
and failed miserably of course is going
to trap a lot of back holders so for the
next time you try to break out the
previous high it will be much harder
because the more time trying to break
the move to the highest the higher the
chance of what today breakouts going to
fail so for you abs you can see this
much communal chargers nothing trying to
tempt it to break 1.64 until about April
29th and also you can see the volume is
significantly different because the
breakout level volume has to be much
higher compared to the original candle
which is April 15th so you can compare
volume for these two candles the breaker
kind of volume has to be much higher
compared to original candle you can see
on this day volume traded about 90
million this day traded about 80 million
if it's the criteria of volume has to be
overwhelming and previous candle for VXR
tea you can see when the stock tends to
break out but the volume didn't really
exceed the original Kindle which is
about 1.9 or $2 ish so for me personally
we weren't trying to abide the breaker
and there see bonds not that significant
and it's not overwhelming the previous
candle I will probably says any much
smaller for you abs and I see the volume
is start to overwhelming everything and
it's going to trade more volume than
before
of course I'm going to sizing little bit
more for you abs I filtered out all of
the tickers as under 1.5 so I didn't
really see this ticker on Terry tends to
break about four levels outrage I do see
a shorting opportunities on your abs on
a second day but there were no shirts to
shore and they stopped trading about
five to four dollar levels so that was
missing out and in conclusion
to look for multi-day break out there's
going to be two criterias we were going
to look for first of all you don't want
many failed spikes in the middle of the
charts of the next breakout won't be as
clean compared to one that has clean
charts second criteria you kind of have
to look for more volume compared to the
previous candle so on you abs 19 million
over 165 million for BX RT into this
breakout candle 34 million does not
overwhelm 76 million so you have to use
this type of criteria to fix your size
when trying to go into a ticker and 4vx
RT definitely going to size it much
smaller and for you ApS definitely
sensing bigger so that will be up the
analysis on v XR t and u abs so let's
talk about capr this one will be the
last ticker for the day overall we look
at the yearly chart there were no
resistance whatsoever yeah sure did
start doing what to daybreak ow around
on this day which is April 24th and you
never know because you never gain any
type of volume so on April 29th we
traded over 200 million volume and I
decided to show using over stand gap
down into this pattern I showed it about
7.3 when it dropped it back to $6 I
didn't really cover anything because I
was too greedy
I thought the stock had a mass amount of
resistance so it could drop a little bit
more to maybe four or five dollar each
area you came back to me and I covered
for scraps into the second day when so I
decided to do a bound short starting
from six one six to nine dollar area you
know didn't really create enough range
it's only up about 30% barely I didn't
really choose to shore large into capr
but I had maximum resistance so it tried
to do a multi-day Berrocal by was some
type of bond shorter there were too many
conflict factors into that day so that's
why I decided now to touch say Apr so
going to the next week or next month I
can see there's going to be a lot of arm
traded in two different tickers and if
you cannot predict how it's going to
perform on the first green day without
any type of
distance always wait wait until the
stock finishes its day and record the
volume if the volume exceed about 70
million to 100 million those who pick
your easy short if it tends to break the
previous day high then you have a
hundred million supportive risk of by
buying too much there breakouts and
these type of patterns are the most
profitable and most predictable patterns
you can do to really grow your small
account for say a PR the XR t you ABS
hopefully you guys learn something new
and focus on one or two patterns to grow
your account before you're really sizing
into this type of no bigger owners in
the first screen day and now be my
safest suggestion to keep you from over
trading and being FOMO so that be the
end of video and thank you very much for
watching this video I will see you guys

overall the flow was really small so I
was being very careful that'll be the
entire trade for the month of May and
pretty much other tickers are small G
and this is where I want to say that you
don't have to trade that much to make a
sufficient enough G throughout the month
I think if you can perfectly trade maybe
three to four trades I think that will
be for pretty much all be GS you can
bring it up up to seven figures even
eight figures by placing four to five
trade depending on your accounts size
but focusing on one strategy or two
strategy and track the frequency and
trade it anywhere between you know 3 to
five times a month I think that would be
uh very good much less stress watching
it and scalping it every single day that
be very efficient and that would
consider much a stressfree type of
strategy trading it throughout the year
but

Mazor May 16 - what's up - Stephen
Baxter welcome to my new weekly video
recap and today we're gonna talk about
one of my big guns a PIL and some
tickers that happen they didn't get
you're sure I'm going to give my thought
process and if you got seriously sure or
if you catch on the long side I'm going
to give you both sides long and short
process so let's get into it so a PIL
kept up on Wednesday and I thought was a
gap up short that turns out to be
holding that $5.00 patient of all really
really good and the stop started
flotation and started rotate twice three
times four times five times
the more you rotates the more is favored
on the long side so if you see the flow
star rotate and some micro flow I
personally I would go in dip but in this
case on a be il and mr. entry I should
give miss Perry Cal five sixty and turns
all the way into 850 so that's about
thirty percent again and in this
specific drop on seven from 735 to 650
right around here and since it's a short
track because in the morning shorts are
already got calling up at 50 ish got
squeezed probably some people still
holding since the shorts are shorting
really close to each other so the
balling Schwartz will push up the stop
into the perc and people who short into
this panic got nervous and start
covering as well if shorts are very
close to each other we call that double
airing of shorts so if two layers are
very close to each other the bottom one
will push the upper one I'll go and push
just up on higher that's why you can be
a petunia short squeeze if you can see
what people are shorted and can use that
to counter stretch them to either go
long or short so I think I showed it
very violent here cover into the
breaking day highs last couple bucks and
when the start coming back down let's do
this one crack I showed it into this
bounce
covered all the way in the 550's I think
that's my average cover I thought it's
gonna go
four-fifty today and i was getting in a
bit too greedy but it turns out and it's
a little slow feeding all day but I let
her take my games and keeping the soccer
chance she rebalances and covered at
6:50 so I grabbed my 40,000 yen think
I'd knocked 5,000 now Wednesday I locked
40 38,000 today so total profit on API
always around 43 K you can make money on
box I allow more short and mr. entry on
the floor rotation on micro flow stocks
on CTX are on this sticker had the news
in the morning
massive parabolic spikes and dropped
exactly where it came from
especially when you're chasing morning
parabolics morning pebbles are really
easy to fill so please don't chase in
100 percent more in parabolic valley is
really really bad risk of war especially
it doesn't even matter is no flaw or not
it's really easy because in the morning
people are more emotional they want to
take their games and leave that's why
most mornings factors not really hold
especially when they expect too far and
I can watch person 200% to shorten to it
it's also really difficult because you
don't know where the resistance is can
use that as your risk level and those
morning spikes can really easy bust
through your resistance level and you
don't even have time to cover and
suddenly you realize the stock is at
five dollars
so I recommend on those if you're a
beginner on those pair about shorts
please be careful start your size small
when the stock drops over 70% of your
skin it's not a deep buy anymore it's
potential short so if people thinking
it's a higher higher low because in the
morning stock is already caught so much
back orders if it drops not much of the
game people will show into any spikes
that's how people went to these things
so if the stock drops too much over 50%
I do not recommend to buy and on
statistics didn't showed out their
results as well I'll see or w-mint upon
chart what will be on my launch for a
few days
I think and give it a couple days you
should have a dump like April to May
21st
so you have to wait for a couple days
but will be on my watch this for next
few days
say RV I didn't rate that much volume so
if you're noticing the low flow are
spiking and it doesn't trade that much
volume don't short into it because you
can't really easy get squeezed out
nowhere something like from 5 to 750
really quick and get dumped in after
hours so that's not worth it
you need the qualities to trade the
stocks especially on low flow stocks
because it doesn't take much shares for
them to drop 50 cents or 10 10% 20% and
that is the rule of trading and
especially in day trading the queerly is
the most important thing in day trading
or swing trading as well swing trading
doesn't really matter equity that much
also as long as you have a vertical
entry and heavy resistance then you're
good but when you're showing your spikes
on really low volume I do not recommend
because they can either break your
resistance really easy or they can dump
your really hard so go long or go short
it's not good enough so I'm really happy
about my API again today for the last
couple of weeks the stock markets been
really boring so all you need to do is
to find the right setups I see a lot of
people making board in trades they make
small mistakes and they add and add and
add become bigger mistakes that's where
they take a huge loss especially
examples like a WX GPR all you need to
do is to be patient because especially
on the first Spiker after a long boring
time period and people going short
really really aggressive you think or
aggressive there's more short squeezes
and there's more wrong like we're flow
starts it's gonna be it's gonna spike
higher so try to tend to avoid on the
first screen day after really boring and
market just be patient wait until the
market comeback
and you will be good to go I think that
will be my entire process for this week
and the hope is helpful thank you very
much
I'll see you guys in the next video

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let's go guys still indexer how welcome
to the new YouTube video so today we're
gonna talk about bunch of tickers fr6
and CET X and overall in June also I'm
going to talk about how does chatroom
really manipulate all those type of
tickers and how does SSR in fact
although stickers as well so let's get
into it and the content is very simple
today if our sxc texts are both
relatively low flow and frt X was not
that bad was relatively little bit
bigger flow but all the volume was
basically traded through a chatroom
pretty much all around right here into
that spike our sales coming from a chat
room and CET X also as well starting
from here and into that squeeze coming
from the cherrim let me tell you some of
the method that chairman people do is
they attract you to join our chat room
then what they use is so let me tell you
some of the method that they use
especially when people are just getting
to market and don't know what they're
doing and planning for our alerts and
this is the most dangerous things you
can do is first you see the flow in
under two minutes I can see the cap is
under 20 million that's considered to be
a micro cap and micro flow
those two are really dangerous
especially going short and long it means
towards the round because there's
potential flow rotations and has a good
news as well but if you are brandy
chasing into strength you're not going
to get somewhere in 201 or 2.50 entry
then if you chase into file you're gonna
become the battlers because people who
are manipulating this or their chair and
buying together if the stock goes up
good you will say oh they made money
with the petitioner alerts if you're
lost money or if the side didn't spike
they sell before they alert so they sold
it did you lose money and this once they
sell the drug comes out all the for
yourself then you will be the one losing
money so as I track by the statistics
you can track as well with too many
samples all those low flow
microphone if you chase into strength
there is about 30% in percentage and if
you are planning to chase into these and
if the sacks on SS are then that just be
really careful think about while you're
trading what kind of pattern trading
always use your statistics on your side
or don't just plan him for following
others I see a lot of people losing
their money because they're trying to
buy this breakout let's also talk about
how SS are effective stocks now SS arts
are short sales restrictions for people
you don't know in terms of beginner and
market SSR is basically if you see to
ask in a bit when you place the order
you cannot hit a bit it means you cannot
execute the shares at a bit you have to
wait until people buy to ask to fill
your shares
now SS are short sellers are around
likely to control the stock especially
on really key levels then you go it goes
to opposite side if the short sellers
cannot take the bid there is going to be
larger spreads and especially unlawful
it will create a bigger spread then
let's say you have a big $1 e up as $2
that's at kind of extraditions but if
the spray is too much they say for about
$1 you can execute at 1.5 and you will
be instant losing 50 Cent's because you
bought a ask so especially on those low
flow micro flow if it's an SSR
microphone the sprayer is huge as soon
as the stock drop first you're gonna get
a really bad execution also SSR gives a
really strict move it means that give
faster move compared to the stock that's
not on SSR let's say a major panic will
tank about 20 cents now if the stock
song SSR will pay about 40 cents that's
also one of them dangerous things you
cannot get a very good executions so on
the first Green Day people are shorting
and trading and going on
our rudia suggest because if they
started from my chat room
well first you buy a really high price
second there's no edge
now if the Chairman gets out I'm to
start doing getting the volume you just
straight drops you just now volume and
look at that look at this fake out
instead almost at our drop
so you cannot predict that I will say
folding stay away from the stickers same
thing with FRS X got tons of lime in the
morning then I just put it all the way
back this one I think was also multiple
chats pumping so if you're gonna short
into chat room pumps then find something
that has bigger flow something like a
round over 20,000,000 then look at the
ticker how much fun is traded throughout
couple hours you can kind of calculate
how much mom's going to be traded
throughout the entire day he is going to
get credit get out and then you're done
for a date and for because other takers
but if it doesn't trade that much fo and
then good for you because once the
Chairman sells then you can't really
manipulate that move that's how SSR
effects stocks and how real cherrim can
manipulate all those low flow tickers
overall very boring in June and there's
a conference coming up in August 17 18
19 last couple days to get tickets if
you don't come to see me live trade I
will put a link below now be it stay
safe in the market and I will see you

SOURCE VIDEO: How Do I Pay Myself with Daytrading？ [PaDybfoArPE].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys esteem inductor today's
topic will be how do you actually take
profits from trading have seen a lot of
questions that have mentioned in YouTube
how do you really take profits off your
trading account so here I will give you
a brief explanations that however I take
profits of my accounts I started with
twenty seven thousand and at that time I
was up about 3000 5000 and 10,000 maybe
sometimes but I really don't know how to
really take profits after I make again
because when I start making a big gains
I want to make more because humans are
agreed it's a natural accelerant nature
so I kind of studied the psychology of
how to give my trading profits out on my
account how to really manage the money
in my trading account and the profits
there's really some kind of skills to it
but it's not that hard big of a deal but
I do this in my own way that I don't get
so pretty emotional and that don't feel
overconfident so here is the method when
I started I have no idea what I'm doing
so I want to hit a hundred thousand at
that point and taking profits it doesn't
really matter because I haven't hit the
maximum that can make from penny stocks
because when you have let's say 20
million dollars that you can't really
trade penny stocks with 20 million
dollars even full because there are
security issues there's not many shares
being traded and there's only any amount
of money you can make a penny stock
especially I already load the query
ticker there's only certain amount of
money you can keeping their trading
account I would say maximum will be 200
to 300 thousand dollars your rate
depends on the brokers though if it's
offshore broker and then 200 300
thousand that's fine and if it's a
legitimate broker that they insure your
money then you can put whatever your
money your trading account but since I
have trade zero and I have certain point
the amount of money keeping our trading
account will be
around to 300,000 sometimes I keep I
keep no more than half a minute because
you'd really don't need to use it there
is very where you trade half million
dollar positions but when you see those
opportunities coming you can go to the
bank and then wire the money in then
treat it and take the profits out so in
general I don't keep too much morning
program to account and I've been
studying the penny stock the maximum
profit can get as I mentioned in the
last video the maximum you can make is
about five to ten million it's not like
a hedge funders you can make to Neiman
in your year you can't do that because
there's only a big amount of money you
can take your painting stocks so each
trade will be around I would say for
loaded query would be thirty thousand
you put in the ticker and you make
around 10,000 20,000 for larger account
can put in sometimes with the good
opportunities that you can put in a
hundred thousand two hundred thousand
and that would say no more than three
hundred thousand positions because
there's really those kind of tickers I
have that kinda quality for you to put
this big amount of positions there's two
examples
IG c and b v those are big those are a
big market cap that is enough for you to
put those big money to make twenty
percent thirty percent better than that
we've been trading penny stocks that
between twenty million to 100 million in
general so you don't really need to put
that much money but before you have all
the hundred thousand two hundred
thousand three hundred thousand i would
say you can take your profits weekly and
once after you have a big game i'll
suggest take half of it because for
human nature when you make that a bunch
of money you want to make more and since
you have more money your trading account
then you want to put more money into
your positions and sometimes you can get
really emotional and that will cause a
big disaster so i typically when i have
a big game i instantly take half to
withdraw half of the profit to my bank
account because then
I feel like already took half of my
profit and you're pretty safe
I think the profits that took is the
loss I took I don't know if that makes
sense because let's say I had a big game
and they the next thing is I took half
of the loss but I actually didn't take
half that off but I think I took a loss
then you will make me more careful into
next trade because I won't get too
overconfident and get myself into really
bad situations so that's probably one of
the method I use that once I have a
hundred thousand two hundred thousand
incident take half of it if I have those
10,000 20,000 then I leave it alone then
they took profits every single week it
depends on how much you make if I make
let's say thirty thousand I take ten
thousand you can make the more I make
them work take so seventy thousand it
takes thirty five thousand in general
with my strategy insuring sometimes go
wrong
because most of HR ensuring to be up to
shore I was saying the more comfortable
range will be around fifty thousand to a
hundred thousand as a beginner some
brokers require about thirty thousand to
open a pocket account and fifty thousand
to a hundred thousand it's more
comfortable range to short
all those lowly query takers that has
really good money percentage I would say
with 50,000 to 100,000 I have ran a
simulation before you can make about 200
to 300 thousand dollars a year if you
have to be perfect disciplined and to
take profits from training account will
limit all those emotional factors and
help you to become a really disciplined

================================================

You know, I normally don't really see
this type of flush after offering. So, I
was checking the filing and saw there's
a S3 filing. Overall, on this trade, I
made about 6 to 7 million because I went
long. I lost about 20% on this one. I
think my size was also pretty heavy. I
lost about, I say, 600K to 800K.
Hello guys, Steam Duxer. Welcome to this
video. And uh we're going to talk about
one of my biggest trade in my career
that I just made few days ago. And it
has been pretty crazy in terms of entry
and exit and how I really executed. A
bunch of adrenaline as well for me. So
I'm going to talk about my thought
process of how I made the trade and uh
in the last two weeks. I think the
overall total profit is around about $17
millionish. There is opportunities left
and right one after another. So, uh, the
biggest trade that were placed were CRCL
and BMLR. This is probably one of the I
say one of the best weeks of my career.
The last one that I had, which is in
2021, that was the DWAP trade. It was
live traded. It's not a single day
biggest profit, but it has probably
close to $20 million within two weeks.
Okay. So, this is the trade that
happened. I think it was on Wednesday.
do all I started beginning to sizing
around 117 once they start testing the
resistance around 125 against the
previous day resistance consolidations
at that time I did not know that there
was a fing coming out I was playing
against the resistance and I I was very
close to it so I was concentrated in
size around 125 to 120 uh when I say
panicked uh into a bounce you know
normally don't really see this type of
flush after offering so I was checking
the filing and saw there's a S3 filing
that they're planning to raise about $2
billion and going to start today selling
direct into the float and I that's where
you know the float is around 1.4 4 to
1.9 million uh in that range. Then when
they're selling direct into the float,
that's when the panic happens. Of
course, it's aligned with same time when
they file S3 filing. So I would say it's
um a partial or good executions with
concentrated size and give me
opportunity to add the full size as I
wanted and also give me a decent I would
say very good convictions of holding a
trade. So overall I was not being shaked
out into the bounces or anything. So
overall again is around 40% to 50% and I
had a total of about 250k to 300k sure
uh I was playing around the size and
covering to see if there's actually a
level two strand or if there's any uh
potential potential bounce is going to
happen. So I was taking profits along
the way and uh it turns out it was a
very good trade. I was very much
debating of holding it overnight because
when they planning to raise about $2
billion in the course of I was saying
they are not going to sell the $2
billion in one day it's going to happen
between you know in the course of a
month in the course of a few weeks and
uh it's going to slowly down trend until
they finish their offerings and probably
there's no buying pressures until then.
My initial goal was thinking about, you
know, $30 or $35 range for the final
cover, but I turns out it was holding
pretty well. I was very skeptical and
also um, you know, my borrow fees was
extremely expensive. It's expensive
because I borrow so many shares. If you
want to only borrow 10,000 or 5,000 uh
shares, I think it's pretty reasonable.
But as you borrow up to 200K, 300K and
you are increase the demand in real
time, that's where uh the price start
get more and more expensive. Uh
basically, I took down pretty much 20%
of the float while the float is around
1.5 to 1.9 million. So that's pretty
much the whole trade in the previous day
chart. I think it was consolidations
between 125. I went to 138 I believe and
125 was the main consolidation. So uh
morning spike tested the uh resistance
that's where it flushed all the way to
60s. Absolutely crazy trade. It's um
pretty much same pattern different day
have bunch of uh concentrated positions
at very high average then there's not
going to be a problem if I want to add
bigger size. So I would say very good
executions from my side. I don't I don't
see if there's any improvement on this
trade, but um overall I'm pretty
satisfied about this one. Let's get into
the next one. All right, let's talk
about another one which is CRCL. This is
not a filing directive. This is just the
one that just goes from 64 to all the
way to 300. and IPO tickers were really
hot. It started with CRWV when the
shares are being locked up about uh I
think was 6 months and institutions can
now sell. There's a whole lot of hypes
around AI sector and the stable coin
sector. So my initial size was I think
it was around 250ish. I went all the way
down to 230. It's not a onetime $5
million trade. The first panic I made
about 1.5. The second panic which is
right here actually around two I think
it was 220ish went all the way to 180.
Totally throughout this day I think was
June 26. Overall on this trade I made
about 67 million because I went long
around 140 150ish made 1 or 2 million on
that 1.5 million and the final flush
it's uh four I think it was 4 million.
If you want to check out the account
statements, it's already posted on X.
Overall, this trade, I don't think I
made any mistakes or took any losses on
this one. CRCL was I'll say in terms of
long and short, only few mistakes there
and there, but not crazy mistakes.
There's one mistakes I made on BMR. Not
technically a mistake. I feel like it's
more of a a losses that's that I had to
take. So it went from 4 to 66 and after
the full panic went all the way down to
43. So I was playing based on the
previous day resistance shorted into the
55ish area and covered covering the 61
in the afternoon. I lost about 20% on
this one. I think my size was also
pretty heavy. I lost about I say 600k to
800k right around there. uh and then um
made it all back. Made about $10 million
on the downside minus that. So the
overall net profit is around 9.3. Yeah,
those are the trades on BMR and CRCL and
one is low flow, one is much bigger
float. CRCL I believe that that could
push in much more size. Probably can
push up to 200. So maybe even up to
millions of shares. I don't think it
will be a problem. Yeah, not enough
convictions on this one. Uh definitely a
learning process. So hopefully we get to
see another CRCL in the future. In terms
of my own judgment, I did not perform
the best on CRCL. Definitely go to study
the chart learning the volume and
hopefully can crush it next time. All
right, guys. That'll be the total recap
of CRCL and BMMR. It's been such a crazy
week. Please leave a comment below and
I'm going to be traveling going to next
month. Other than that, I will be seeing
you guys next time.

Make sure sizing small. Expect much I
will say wider swings compared to
shorting after first red day. So overall
there was 3.8 million was made on POTR.
Going forward uh there's going to be
more videos to come. Hello guys, Stephen
here. I know it's been quite a long
time. Last time I filmed was couple
months ago. Personally, I've been doing
a lot of moving to Puerto Rico. So right
here is a brand new setup. There is a
lot of trades been going on in the last
few months. So I haven't done any recaps
and the market conditions has changed a
decent amount. There's a lot of uh fake
liquidities compared to the years in
2020 to 2021 even compared to last year.
So going to go over some of the details
and some of the volume fees that came up
in this year. So before I start this
video, make sure to click the like
button and subscribe. Let's get into it.
All right. So let's go over the most
recent ones. SBT. This one is a Bitcoin
treasury play. It's been happening for
quite a month now. Lots of tickers has
been running based on the company wants
to raise money for Bitcoin treasuries
and they're going to establish a Bitcoin
reserve to purchase any cryptos. From my
point of view, they're all copying MSTR.
Another standing point is they're just
doing dilutions for the shareholders
then hopefully to become the next MSTR.
So the news has been brand new for a
month ago. Everything has been running
crazy. ASST, KDLY, then we are the
latest runner is SBT. Overall hadn't
placed a single trade on this ticker
because the flow is around 600K. But I
do want to talk about the last day which
it went to 124. It had its top around
122, did a fake out and pushed all the
way back down to 84. I wanted to short
into the bounce but there's no
consolidations whatsoever and of course
they did offering the after hours and
this one will probably fade back all the
way to even probably lower than 11 as
the market as all the traders are
getting adapted to the news of company
just randomly want to establish a crypto
treasury the spiking potential is not
going to be as much as before there's
one trade that I made I actually took a
loss on is ASST if you take a look at
the basic technical analysis is after
the f first bound and the second day
bound whenever you are shorting a
multi-day owner you typically want
something to extend over 500% within 2
to 3 days and of course this one did
meet the criteria with the float and
market cap then going into the third day
which you traded much less volume that's
number one number two is the
consolidation range is pretty much stuck
around the same place. So I did take a
short around 7.6. Got stopped out I
think was 8.6. That one I think is
probably not avoidable. We have a decent
amount comparison with decent multi-day
honors. Anytime that if you're dealing
with Bitcoin treasury type of tickers,
always be really careful about your
sizing in and your uh risk management.
Majority of other sectors other than
biotech and energy sectors. Now we have
to add another one. Bitcoin sectors.
Anything that's related to Bitcoin
energy and healthcare always tend to
size down and this one did not play as a
normal multi-day runners and it was
definitely very choppy. This one was the
loss I took. I think I sized around 300k
shares. So that's around 300k loss. Then
there's two other tickers. C. Yeah, I
think the mistake that was made by
myself, I think this is I think it's
available loss. So, same thing since IPO
went from 11 to 40. So, overall up about
400%. And we see that we tested the same
double top very similar volume. And on
the third day with lower volume, of
course, we did not drop at all. So, on
this day, I think I took a smaller loss.
If we can go into the 15minut chart.
This one is it went all the way to 50
but I think it got stopped out. I think
it's in the 39. I shorted around 38
37ish. Then of course did not catch the
top of 56 because once we did a 40
breakout around 37 36 there's a massive
support underneath. So shorting around
40 technically is not very ideal. There
is a very limited reward. Did not catch
CP. This one was also a strange one.
Then NAX, this is not a biotech sector,
not a Bitcoin sector. We went from 14 to
265. There was two trade that was made
on this ticker. The first trade is when
it went to 190 and came back down to
110. So 50% draw down. And once it had a
bounce, I took a size around 154 risking
the 190ish. The sizing was relatively
small, but I did took a loss right about
here once the fully breakout happens. I
did not touch it until the next day.
Majority of time, we typically don't
short something that gaps down 20 to
30%. But this is so overextended that
the stock is up around 1,00500%.
Took some size around 160, added in the
140, then added in the 130, covered all
the way back in the 50s. Majority of the
cover happened around 70s. So, did not
catch the bottom, but that was a very
solid reward. There's total about 1.5
million made on NMAX. Interested in

Now, let's dive back into the content.
Then, going to the next one, we had
PLTR. This is the biggest trade that was
made in end of February. So if you look
at the monthly chart, this one was
pretty much trending up every single
month. Then once the news was released
that they're going to cut the federal
spending in this one from 120 to 108.
Fortunately, I was be able to catch it
around 118. Then after first red day,
we're going to add another 15 to 20%
fading percentage. So I cover bird. I
think it was around on 99 to 98ish. Once
the 100 round number broke, that's where
I took my full size out. So overall,
there was 3.8 million was made on POTR.
Uh the account statement was posted on
on X. That was pretty much the full
trade. I was not expecting this one come
back all the way back to 130, but looks
like it's going much higher and
hopefully one day becomes another short
again. So we'll see. Those are pretty
much all the important trade that
happened in the last few months. We also
had BULL another IPL 1 to70 and we
tested multiple times as overstaining
gap down. So here is one thing uh
whenever you are trying to short over
gap down and very important that if the
ticker only tends to run as one green
day not a second one the ticker becomes
very stubborn in terms of it will
produce multiple bounces if it performs
overstaining gap down. The ticker has to
run at least 2 days up over 500% for it
to qualify as a multi-day runner. Of
course, made a mistake again. I shorted
it into the push around 50. I think it
was 54 55. Got stopped out and then
reshorted it again once was a big
rejection. I took very smaller cuts on
BL. So overall, it's not very ideal, but
I can see that the mistake is definitely
avoidable. And of course going to the
second day testing 52 that was a easy
short again which I did not catch. I was
treating this one more of like first red
day as a multi-day honor. Whenever a
multi-day honor happens going into the
day after the first red day we typically
don't have any spikes. We don't really
have volume. We open with a 10% to 15%
and we either don't move or comes back
up a little bit in the afternoon. Was
not expecting this move. I can see it's
a very easy sure I did not catch it. So
that was my mistake. Okay. So another
quantum play QBTS. This is where I want
to talk about fake liquidities and be
very careful about whenever you go long
and using the support as your risk. So
the overall chart looks pretty
persuasive when it breaks out around 12.
So going long around 13 to 14 which is
risking 12 which is not very bad. But
you can see the extension of the chart
now in a long-term run it's up around
1,700%.
It's up quite a bit and you can see that
you know when we had a major breakout
the extensions is not very far when so
let's say we have a a solid breakout
around 12. So we sing around 13 the exit
will be 20. Whenever we're trading
something that's not very extended, the
extension is a much bigger compared to
going from 13 to 20. And also we had a
decent red day in the middle. So it's
very difficult to be able to catch the
top and going long around 13 to 14.
Probably your average exit will be
around 17.5 or maybe 18. So there is
very limited reward. Whenever you are
using multi-day breakouts, that ticker
is already very overextended. be very
careful and also take profits quickly
because it's not going to run very far.
Probably going to stay or hold its cam
for one or two days and it will start to
get rejected. All right guys, that'll be
pretty much all the important tickers or
large caps and IPOs I want to cover.
Make sure that whenever you are going
long that ticker that's already extended
with very heavy resistance breakout make
sure take profits quickly and also if
it's a first green day without more
extensions on the following up to become
a multi-day runner expect there's going
to be multi- bounces going to happen in
intraday level so make sure sizing small
expect much I will say wider swings
compared to shorting after first red day
so going forward uh there's going to be
more videos to come and there's One more
video going to cover pretty much the
smaller caps like UPXI and DATS. So
those are the easy ones. Now I can short
into resistance. And I also want to talk
about the resistance overwhelming and
the pre-market volume. We cannot use the
volume estimate that we came up in 2021
to 2020. The liquidity itself seems not
as strong as before. I don't want to
call fake liquidity because sometimes
you see a ticker trades 15 million M in
the premarket. It does not trade like in
2020 to 2021. No push, pretty much a
very standard fade going throughout the
day. So, the next video going to talk
about how to really adapt to very
crowded pre-market volume. That'll be
it. Uh, thank you very much for watching
and I will see you guys in next one.

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys doer welcome to this video uh
and it's been a very exciting month
there is I'll say 20 to 30 plays across
the entire month uh ever since we had
drug as the main play there's a lot of
sympathy plays as biotechs technology
and bunch of roow full stocks so in this
hype it's a little bit different
compared to the hype we had in February
the main play was BMR and the flow was a
little bit bigger and it was main AI
play most of the float that we traded in
February was around 3 to 4 million maybe
a little bit higher some some we saw was
10 million float and in this specific
hype pretty much all of them is trading
anywhere between 700k to 1 million and
the majority of them are below 500k so
200k to 300K float which is not really
tradable it's considered to be a nano
float and I do see uh a lot of
psychology is changing around on the
slow float in terms of the borrows and
how you're supposed to trade them and
also some of the premarket volume
estimation is been changing a little bit
as well and let's get into those details
in this video and hopefully it's will be
helpful and make sure click like the
button and subscribe and let's get into
it all right so the first one we want to
talk about will be
Dru this is the one that bought pretty
much all the volume out the initial
Spike starting at my$ da went all the
way to 50 first screen day of of course
I did not touch it I touched it on the
second day when it tested the 26 area I
was not expecting this one goes all the
way to 36 and potentially causing a big
breakout on this specific day I think I
lost a little bit because I was sizing
down on the breakout I short it in the
26 to 30ish turns out did not work out
very well it was also low float and that
did not hold overnight because the
overnight rates was extremely expensive
I think was 500% throughout the year so
so is about $1 per share overnight
extremely expensive did not get the
reward on the first red day because it's
not really worth it if you're holding
10,000 shares overnight and you will be
paying $115,000 I do remember the rates
at that point so it was expensive then
going to the following spikes when all
the way to 80 I did try some in the
consolidations when it was trying to
consolidate in the 50 to 60 years traded
about 20 million shares over a$1 billion
traded and the worked out and did a
massive Spike cut the losses in a 65 is
then went all the way down was little
bit triggered on this one then had his
resp Spike on the following day shorted
it into a spike I think I made money
going into this day and tried again I
think was right here I was hoping it
breaks 41 as the 41 breaks this goes all
the way to back to 20 and for majority
of the multi Runners most of them fade
75% after it round up and this is a
special one because it's been 2 weeks
and this one still holding a $50 level
because it's a BoTech it doesn't have
Thea patterns I've been tracking botex
for many years this one gives me one of
the warnings that do not trade botex
anymore took three losses on this one
just not really worth it and also it's a
very low float and the spread is kind of
crazy 200k volume can make the stop push
it $10 and it can ignore the resistance
as well so it's very difficult to manage
your risk on this
one the ticker that I made uh 300K was
djt it had the resistance in the 38 so
it tested 32 33 is this is where I sized
in so let's go into the intr level so it
break down in the afternoon and uh it
had its gap down and showed really big
weaknesses in the premarket also as the
market open I shorted it in a 32 is was
doing pretty big size because I think if
there's a mass resistance in 37 and
we're topping at 33 it's not really
worth it to re break 33 and go test that
38 resistance again because there's
multiple resistance up in the 40s 50s
and 60s I piled pretty big size into it
100K shares and once the breakdown
happened I was covering adding the
bounces at covering adding bounces
overall was uh 350,000 G and going to
the second bouncing on the following day
I saw the re breakout on the $29 area
this is where I cut it my position I
took a very small loss on this one I
think the previous day was close to
380,000 and I lost 20K or 25k on a
second day so overall was $350 60,000 G
I'm going to the following breakouts and
overall thought process on djt going
forward in the next two weeks so this is
going to be a little bit tricky because
it had its massive consolidation
resistance in the 54 some resistance in
the 40s so if you go into July 15th
there is multi- layer of resistance
between 38 and 43 so July 15th might
here this is the biggest consolidations
and most concentrated volume stated in
the 42 area so let's see how it gaps on
Monday if it test the 42 in the
premarket and it showed that there's
solid resistance in in the 42 and we
consolidate for another maybe 100
million volume then that could be a
topping sign that could be a swing short
on DJ I think it's being a little bit
overextended from 10 to 40 and it's a
multi-billion dollar stock so of course
the liquidity shouldn't be a problem
it's more about timing and risk
management and this is much easier to
trade compared to theug interested in

let's dive back into the
content VSS was also a trach line it's
very easy to get stopped out on this
because he traded I believe was 25
million volume in the pre market and
they had had pretty much 300% spiking
percentage after market open busted
through this pre-market high and it's
very easy to show against the pre market
resistance and get stopped down when it
had a massive parabolic and of course it
faded all the way down and if you don't
partial size and your P size into
against sprem Market high and then I
would imagine this would be relatively
big loss so going forward if you see
that pre-market Vol is extremely crowded
over 20 million I always always
recommend that you want to wait until at
least 10:00 before it size in and also
pay attention to the single candle
volume so let's see what we can learn
from the intraday volume let's go into
one more 2 minute so as a crow taker the
highest volume that's traded on a single
candle was about 3.2 million on $9 on
the single candle level volume it trades
about $30 million if it's back down it
had 4 million at8 so typically after a
big volume there's full of volume to
test the the high again once the volume
Fades under the 4 million you will be a
good signal to enter so still when the
pre-market shows weaknesses I think it's
a good idea to size against the
pre-market high but always pay attention
to the pre-market volume if it breaks I
think it's worth it to cut your losses
and re-enter again it's not really worth
it to keep adding into the spike and
potentially being really nervous and
take a huge loss so let's say I short it
against the premarket High winning
around 96 950 or 6 risking 650 when it
breaks I come it losses and I choose
another candle to re enter even though I
short into the bounds let's say a seven
and then cover by the end of the day
four I still come on top after the
losses with crowded takers pay attention
to the volume also pay attention to the
time because you know most people are
likely to enter chasing into the tickers
majority of the time momentum doesn't
shift until 10 or 10:30 maybe 11 make
sure sizing small and this is also a
very low flow tier only 1 million floats
make sure that you're sizing in
correctly and also take your profits
along the way because when it's there's
low flow the spread is huge very easy to
get shaked out take your profits on the
weaknesses of the candle so you do not
want to really cover being shaked out
into those fake breakouts and that's the
best way to trade lower float I would
say nanof floats bit under 2 minum
now we had another ticker which is very
confusing I didn't sizeing into NXX this
one went all the way down fed 100% from
the top so this one traded 30 minute
shares in the Prem Market of course 3
minute flow it's not a big float
majority of the time we will see at
least some push percentage in after
market open this one did not push at all
it was trading like it's a 10 minum
float of course sing into the bounds
when it already faded 60% or 75% from
top it's not a very ideal if you B
shares you can size into the push and
the major consolidation is at eight so I
will say shorting into the bounces
risking a is not a bad idea but you
can't really size in as big as you
wanted so the only few tickers that was
tradeable that I believe was NXX and vs
and potentially djt other than those
three takers every single tier was under
300K FR or 500k which is not really
shortable so I would recommend for
beginners to avoid all these tickers and
looks like the market is still holding
really strong and we're still seeing
tons of B pouring in so there's going to
be another I'll say two weeks of really
hyp up week avoid tickers that's I'll
say below 1 million float pay attention
to your borrow fees and overnight fees
and typically those low flows can charge
up in 1,000% per night it can be very
costly and very expensive so all right
guys that'll be it of this video thank
you very much for watching I'll see you

You've essentially taken $27,000 and
made north of $50 million from the
markets. Is that true?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And you learned to trade within 6
months.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; What would you say is the number one
skill or trait that has allowed you to
make such returns from the markets?
&gt;&gt; Um,
&gt;&gt; meet Steven Ducks, an 8 figureure
verified trader that turned a few
thousand into millions.
&gt;&gt; He holds the record for the highest P&amp;L
in a single trading day in 2022. over $6
million
&gt;&gt; in 2021. I did a really good month. I
think in that month I made $20 million
in one month
&gt;&gt; when you had that huge month. What were
you feeling at that time?
&gt;&gt; I was feeling on top of the world. About
two 20 seconds at that time. You were
too bad.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But yeah, it was
people look at me as the the best trader
out there. I taught many students. 90%
of them becomes gamblers. They make one
huge trade and they think they can make
it again. It's actually making a huge
gain in one trade is not very good for
beginner traders because they don't know
how to handle that emotions. Then it
turns into gambling habits and they just
got addicted to it.
&gt;&gt; What do you say to to those traders that
when you see that happening?
&gt;&gt; Let me explain one strategy. Uh so it's
based on human nature. Originally the
strategy comes from human nature. So let
me give you example. Let's say you
bought a stock at $10.
Do you believe that if traders followed
say you know the blueprint of everything
that you've done that they could achieve
the same results or do you believe that
there's only a very few and finite
amount of traders in the retail world
and and from the independent traders who
can hit that 8 figure return level?

hello guys Ste D so today I'm going to
do a recap about my djt trade the
overall profits was around 900,000 in
this overall trade there's some of the
mistakes that I made and some of the my
thinking process through how to really
take profits and where the my entry is
and uh going to talk through the entire
trade of djt and what the mistakes that
I made are and going to talk about some
of the next step of trading going into
next week so before I start this video
make sure to click the like button and
subscribe let's get into it so here is
my overall trade you can see that the
total profit is around 880,000
originally was 940,000 I lost about I
think it was 60k shorting into the bals
and that will explain that mistakes
overall here's the execution chart of
where I entered where I exited I start
building a position actually from the
previous day so let's talk about that
originally the on djt I think was on
Tuesday it had its massive pullback
first of all we had a 100 million
support in a 47 is it dipped through the
support actually came back uh reclaim
the 47 area and that's where I exited I
think I was shorting into the bouns in
the 50s and uh covered in the 47s so
made a very small profit of 50k once it
reclaimed the support area I exited I
was waiting for consolidations to happen
I start building my positions into the
54 and 52 is of course I didn't want to
hold over night cuz there's a potential
possibility that this one could Gap up
and I only held about 10K shares
overnight in the 52 is of course if it
breaks 54 I'll lose 20K and woke up very
early going to the next day and start
building my positions into the 49s my
average is actually around I think go
are
49 and eventually got to 408 so I was
adding into the push into the secondary
test this one got little bit nervous
because my my size was relatively big
and my risk is 54 so I'm risking $4
overall within about I think it around
8K shares so once it rejected I re
measured my risk into the 50s then once
the breakdown happens added in some of
the shares in 47 then it broke down ever
since so if you take a look at the
entire run it's been running for almost
2 months starting at $10 you can see
there's a massive support in the 30s
because it started to break out at 30
and start to go parabolic after 30 and
we're running into going to the next
week of the final election week I was
thinking that maybe if the support is
around 30 and 35ish po covering around
35 will be ideal and I didn't really
sure going to the next 2 days because I
think we're way close to the support and
actually dep under it I think I was long
very little into the 35ish lost a little
a little bit but not too crazy the main
profits was captured between 50 to 38
and as I recognized that there's multi-
support around 30 28 33 so I covered
into the 38 interested in trading like

simply click the link in the description
below to get started now let's dive back
into the content and I still think that
as the stock going down we're in the
first red day so of course the balance
will likely to get destroyed
unfortunately I did manage to cover most
of my shares I I think I only have 5K
left and I was adding 1,000 increments
going while the socket is going up so I
saw the massive rejection in the 43 so I
added in the balance of 42 and once it
came back broke out a little bit I think
I was not very comfortable because it
broke the original breakdown point is at
43 so I start to size down while it's
going down didn't hold many shares I
only held about 15K going to the end of
the day and I saw going to the next day
gaps up typically when you Gap up the
stock has already formed the bottom and
I downsized actually while it's going
down so I didn't make any profits going
to next day and I was trying to De
buying the 35ish but you can see
Consolidated for the entire day so I
exited going to the end of the day and
that's pretty much the entire trade of
djt going to the next week I think in
the upcoming election and since we're at
the support level we're likely to see a
good bounce the bounce could Gap up the
stock up to to maybe even 50 to 30% if
Trump wins and uh we might have a really
good bounce to short now that's a 50/50
chance so I do not recommend holding
Lawns going to next week react when
stock give opportunities so that will be
my thoughts on overall djt ticker all
right guys that'll be the whole review
for djt trade hopefully we can get a
good bounce next week and the volume is
actually coming in so after djt trade I
think we should have bunch of
opportunities that's or retails that
made money in front the sticker that'll
be the entire video thank you very much

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys Ste du here welcome to this
video So today we're going to talk about
so far between January to March overall
trading performances for me and this
year the market is doing much better
compared to last year last year we have
bunch of low floats tons of biotechs and
a lot of short squeezes of course that's
very manipulated so it's very difficult
to trade because they do not form
consolidations this year I can kind of
tell that there is a 2021 type of
opportunity that's coming back so of
course we're going to go over all of
those opportunities and uh let's get
into
it all right so the first I want to talk
about my trade zero account in the last
3 months I have made approximately about
700,000 I've down a little bit in March
so far let's take a look at the losses
by symbols starting from January of 2024
there is one big loss on aisp and other
than that everything is pretty much all
green and 30 there's total about 33
trades total loss on the ticker 1 2 3 4
5 six six tickers overall and of course
going to go over the biggest mistakes
and going to go over the biggest skin as
well let's get into
it let's uh go over aisp this is one of
the biggest mistakes that I made in 2024
so far of course size didn't too big and
uh it turned out to be a second Green
Day type of multi- rers uh let's go over
to the first day this is where I made
the mistake March 5th of course this one
it was a typal gap upshore I traded way
too much volume I traded around 160
million shares around 1 to 130ish so
that's way too many shares that's been
traded you a really low priced stock uh
typically that we want to short
something that's above three and so we
get some type of reward when the stock
fads back to low twos but if the stock
trades way too much volume it will
generate so much buyer and sellers and
make the trade very crowded and if the
stock is easy to borrow and there's too
much volume you will reduce the reward
for stock going down so there's not much
reward going down then of course the
Stock's likely to to squeeze and this is
where I shorted it I think it's anywhere
between 3.25 to 3.3 I was adding exiting
uh in the consolidations looking for a
consolidation breakdown in the late
afternoon but uh it turned had a its
breakout it had multiple very fast drop
candles in the afternoon and typically
when we R into late day that the stock
is not likely to generate more volume
going into the next day so there's no
followup and what happens is the stock
breaks out of the consolidation Zone
then they do a fake out then crash all
the way down back to three of course
this one didn't do what I thought it
would be doing so I should have
respected my risk exiting the
consolidation breakout then don't even
touch it uh in the afternoon and of
course in the next day the stock did not
generate enough volume and the stock
panics and went all the way down what we
can learn from this trade is first of
all do not show a tier that's crowded
very low price stocks very difficult to
put enough size into it because if stock
is crowded if you want to sh a decent
amount of position size that you it
requires a lot of shares and it will
take very long time to exit and you were
likely to push the stock up if you're
short so if the is higher price the less
shares you need and it will less affect
the stock on its float and that's where
you can freely be exiting and take your
entry without a problem but with the
lower price stocks it requires a lot of
shares and of course it will will take
much longer to exit and with the market
order will instantly push the stock up
you know almost $1 also if the stock
trades over 100 million volume how
before 1:00 if the stock is not getting
up you know 1,000% 2,000% in the
consolidations if it's it's only up 3
400% it's not really worth it if it's
too cheap definitely made a mistake and
uh it will be something that you know I
try not to go into make going into

click the link in the description below
to get started now let's dive back into
the
content biggest game will be cpop so
this one was played multiple times into
boun and it was made a total of three to
four attempt so first of all we had a
push all the way to eight against the
pre market high that was typical Gap up
short going to the next day this was a
bounce short going to the yesterday's
resistance so this will be the biggest
profit that was made I made about 100K
on the way down covered in around 5.5 I
was about entry tiet entry around 9 but
skipped it slip through so it's late
afternoon 100K here 50k here then
another 100K going to bound short with
stop going from 4 to 9 then short it
again made up another 50k then that's
the three trades that made on the same
ticker uh each time made about 60 Kish
total of 200k this is a a regular
pattern that wasn't very crowded and it
was testing you know on the top of the
resistance did create enough inch so
it's definitely shortable the only thing
that's not good for this one it's uh low
F something to remember is whenever
you're are shorting a ticker that's very
cheap and aisp the reason why saying so
much you can kind of tell that the float
is 12 million to 18 million traded 200
million shares March 5th so even though
when the flow is really big if the share
trade is large enough that you will
rotate the same amount of times that a
low flow will rotate like cpop so let's
say cpop uh traded 72 million shares
first day traded 40 42 right let's
assume is 42 proo is about 1 million 1.3
million so we rotated about 30 something
times for aisp that we have 12 million
shares at that day 200 million shares
traded so we roted about 10 times and
the bigger volume KN gets on the
intraday level uh you want to use that
to divide by the flow to see how many
rotation that happened down that day if
it trades a large amount of volume that
means the rotation number is going to be
very similar to the ticker that trades
on a lowlow area which will be 1 to 2
million so that you have to be very
careful and also when the stock is
getting cheap be aware of how much sies
you are going in and do not make the
mistakes that I do the I think the
270k losses I was taken on this year
first of all if the stock breaks out its
consolidations and that's where you exit
that's where I did exit and there's
multiple attempts I did in the afternoon
trying to aim for a breakdown or a fake
out goes all the way down to three and
that's where I took the major loss the
first breakout I only took less than
100K then each time on the fake outs up
and down up and downs that was the risk
of the losses each time was 75k to 60k
is that's where the major loss came in
so it was multiple attempt it's not one
goal that I didn't know sizeing too big
but the size wasn't a problem it's the
multiple attempt go into a crowd tickers
and a breakout finishing in the end of
the day as I talked about in the
previous video that you do not want to
attempt multiple trade in one day after
you take a initial big loss multiple
atts after that without a very good
conviction to be able to tell what
pattern it is which I couldn't really
tell it was just based on a fake out
Theory now it's not really supported by
statistics and sometimes it doesn't
really work the range wasn't very enough
because the consolidation breakouts at
three which traded 160 minute shares the
breakout level becomes the support which
is another 160 minute support So
shorting around five and me to cover at
three it's not very ideal it's not a
very standard reward for short sellers
to go for those are the one losses one G
that already stand out throughout the
throughout the year so far so I'll happy
to share my losses and take my lessons
so I get to learn from it and move
forward of course going to improve my uh
discipline also improve my um
consistencies so do not once when you
make a mistakes learn from it and move
forward do not be carried by losses too
far stay away from low price stickers
that's very crowded also once the
consolidation breakout happen do not
make multiple attempts in the afternoon
also make sure you have a good
conviction to be able to tell what
pattern it is to trade in the future for
cpop not just the regular game for
multiple atts for B short all right guys
that'll be the two trades biggest losses
and biggest wins for the year and
there's a lot of tickers that happened
this year but of course I'm going to
share my biggest losses so you guys can
take away uh what I learned and uh
trading has to be always improving based
on yourself and and hopefully you learn

all right so first of all that p-h-u-n
this is the simplified plane
of dwac this one is a gap the resistance
most of the time gap through resistance
doesn't really work
uh then we have dwac
this one didn't really form a pre-market
top
so i don't know how far this one can go
uh
maybe goes up into the hundreds
are pretty close to 100
but i'll definitely keep a very close
watch on
both
it's going to do a pull some
sometime
and
the support is 52 so ideally you flip
double from support which will be 104.
um other than that we need to see like a
very very solid consolidation
without consolidations you can short
into these
today is likely to pull if it goes over
one one something hundred
goes back to 40
bounce back to 72
then fade back to 40 again that's my
guess
uh on monday so probably gap down on
monday
this one will do the same push in the
morning dump
uh in the afternoon uh in the mid
at noon
bounce
on saturday
drop
that's my guess for a day
i can't focus on any other tickers on
today will only be dwac and phu
i can't trade four or five tickets at
once so i'm not gonna touch those
but it squeezed so high yesterday
there's gotta be somebody got squeezed
it looks like on twitter everybody made
a killing on the launch
this has to be somebody got caught off
guard on this
have you borrowed yeah i borrowed it
it's cheap
yeah this is insane this is my trade
like a bidding shirt today
this one might trade 200 million so
now this is a little bit this is very
similar to the gme
in terms of cap initial cap
initial cap is a little bit lower than
gme so block will be lower and jme
dollar block was 30 to 40 billion right
so today if he trades
100 million at 10 100
that's 10 billion
so he needs to trade
200 million and 100 before it drops
or pretty far from there
um
this won't be tough to trade yet
i'm just going to draw my guess right
here and people would just join late and
they want me to repeat again
there we go
i don't have a solid guess for this this
is this is
out of the statistics
everybody is chasing
it's gonna end really bad for this
sticker
it was a long this morning not really
when you're buying at 72
and making the 20 to 96 that's already
chasing
the beginning cap for dwc is 350 million
correct use up a thousand percent so
yeah
this pre-market action
really has no edge
so
going it's pretty much suicide
even dan is texting me what do you think
will happen on dwac i don't know
how will you know i don't know yet
i will let you know when i enter
this is
tough to trade though especially when
you are trading
within five minute candle range it's a
really difficult trade
i don't see pullbacks i don't pure
strength and no pullback
it's the second green day so today
now
second green day this is a little bit
different this one didn't perform any
type of pullback so today it's going to
pull hard
in terms of dropping today is going to
drop i just don't know where it's going
to drop once it drops it's it will be a
good dip buy opportunity at 50.
then
um
oh god
somebody's getting squeezed i don't know
who's getting squeezed
i'll work but touch 100.
this is history here
oh my god we just broke a hundred
what the hell yesterday was that talk
about it
house is different than kldk a little
bit different
trump is the one behind this one so
i don't have sauce for any other ticker
what i'm supposed to do with this one
it's not even moving
it's 2.5 minutes you're actually on the
plane yet no idea
there has to be somebody that's shorting
this
there's no way this one goes this time
without shorting stock
and some margin card is going to come in
the morning cause the stock to squeeze
then touches i don't know where it's
going to touch it's too crazy
to calculate flow rotation does the
ticker needs to be a gapper or it
doesn't need to be a multi-developer it
can be both
do you know p
p h
u is the actual related to w c before it
can be assumed to play just a random
yeah i don't know if you're supposed to
touch this today
this is
this is insane
what is going on
yeah
i'm just gonna sit here and wait
it's 110.
yeah wait for consolidation
the child doesn't even go that high
oh my god
whoa
calm down
no i don't see i i can't read this is
beyond my

per share
like gme amc that's fine those are
initially billion dollar cap right

imagined to be
out at 89.
i'll add i want to say dips a little bit
more
all right let's just stay partial right
here
i'm not very good at buying though but
89 is pretty good for me
so it touches 120 i sell and then short
again
i covered all my shorts
yeah i covered all
i covered everything around uh
80 something yeah 87 then i reversed it
to go long
all 40 would be lovely yeah i'm probably
being very nice
i'm 14 nice

good
i didn't catch the bottom but i'm pretty
close
holy shoot
all right so the partial 115
that was not me guys that was not me
oh so
slowly

this one should break once 15 yeah
19.
so then another partial 118
so the half 119
all right i'll leave the rest in there
nice hold it
once the next stop i think it bounced to
140 something i don't know
it has to get hold it first
i still have half

i don't think it drops here but
it might drop we'll see
all right let me just put back the
statute
i don't think it does here there's no
way that's here and he already showed
the dip
so it has to reverse
i'm gonna have little bit shares left so
i don't really care if you reverse or
not

uh
i realized pretty much everything
now
[Music]
um
all right
96.
you could tony try this let me ask
them

it doesn't really matter if it
if it drops out dip back over here
this is the 75 area
all right
go through that yeah
a lot small 72 74
only small guys don't go too big

better
not going back to the statue trade
guys remember i have a 100k that i have
that 100 000 shares
this i should bounce back to a hundred
nine
if not more
probably should reduce some signs once
it after this hole
once this one goes back to
[Music]
1 10.
i'll start piloting the real size and
then make
that make the eight figures not the
downside
but i haven't 11 finished yet we're
still have a long one though
all right so partial 91
all right 20 thousand now

uh tinker county
if you guys ever was fun to watch that
okay last night

realize 4.8 million
why is it a wise decision
i don't think so
yeah
volunteer voice

gotta think very rational whenever
you're up really big
it's very easy to screw up
all right i sold my p
p something p h u n
so sound 103 tiny

109 104
it's a pretty solid bounce but it's not
a really free bounce
that's a pretty solid answer in mind
let's go a little bit higher
what percent of your account do you use
to enter and trade i don't even i don't
know i just had my risk in my mind
300k risk
all right so the nar109
i have small left
here's my
i'll see i don't think it will help when
it's too high 140 will be the highest
you can hit
yeah i'm not gonna go for a round number
guys
i just go over the charcoals never try
to hit round numbers i'm i'd rather be
at four million nine hundred not
a hundred thousand
four nine nine nine
nine
i still wouldn't make that one dollar
if if the pattern is not there
like i have
taken enough making enough mistakes
trying to hit a round number
yep that one dollar cost me big time
i saw the rejection
all right so though my lawns are 105.
stocks for long trade
this one's still shortable not yet guys
not yet
just wait
what do you think you're looking for
here um

ASST if you take a look at the basic
technical analysis is after the FA first
day bound and the second day bound
whenever you are shorting a multi-day
owner you typically want something to
extend over 500% within 2 to 3 days and
of course this one did meet the criteria
with the float and market cap then going
into the third day which you traded much
less volume that's number one number two
is the consolidation range is pretty
much stuck around the same place. So I
did take a short around 7.6 got stopped
out I think was 8.6. That one I think is
probably not avoidable. We have a decent
amount comparison with decent multi-day
owners. Anytime that if you are dealing
with Bitcoin treasury type of tickers,
always be really careful about your
sizing in and your uh risk management.

as the stock going down where in the
first red day so of course the bounce
will likely to get destroyed
unfortunately I did manage to cover most
of my shares I think I only have 5K left
and I was adding 1,000 increments going
while the sock is going up so I saw the
massive rejection in the 43 so I added
in the balance of 42 and once it came
back broke out a little bit I think I
was not very comfortable because it
broke the original breakdown point is at
43 so it start to size down uh it's
going down didn't hold many shares I
only held about 15K going to the end of
the day

so this is a classic Bor Shoring into
Massive Resistance the only thing is to
how to really manage your risk because
whenever you're shorting around 45 your
risk is all the way to 54 so risking
almost 30% of your entry so if you
manage to capture the again from 55 to
42 you can use that as your leverage and
increasing your risk to be able to short
into the 45 then cover into the 20 I
believe like the final cover was 28 I
did not expecting this one go all the
way to 33 so lost on profits here but
that's pretty much the entire djt trade

hello guys Ste duer welcome to this
video so today in this video after I did
a video about the biggest losses and the
biggest skin so far this year between
January to March and uh there's
something that I want to share with my
trading experience of course in this
year and how to really stay consistent
profitable from going forward before I
start this video make sure to click the
like button and subscribe let's get into
it so going to this year that I found
out there is definitely more
opportunities that's in 2023 compared to
2022 and everything is surrounded by AI
every few years we will have one or two
years we will have one of the sectors
that's going to be helped up in 2018 was
about the shipping companies 2020 was Co
and also biotechs as well because there
is a vaccine being researched for CID
2021 we we have gme MC of the meme
stocks and we kind of took a dip in 2022
and took a rest in 2023 then we coming
back with right now that's being hot
it's a Bitcoin and the AI sector meaning
majority of the tech stocks were driven
by AIS every time window those hype
happens uh we will have about one or two
months of tickers going pretty much
ballistic from 1 to 20 1 to 100 back in
the days in 2017 we had the ticker
squeeze from 4 to 100 and those tickers
are very difficult to short and I see a
lot of people BW up on the front side
and few shorts Setters can be able to
make it by not taking losses in the FR
side so as a Trader you have to be very
aware of those seasonal opportunities
that's going to come whenever you see a
very boring season that Traders always
want to make a trade to make profit and
that's where hype comes in the perfect
wave that every short aggressive short
seters are shorting it too early causing
the stock or go from 1 to 50 you know 1
to 100 and you can see people taking
millions of dollars of losses in
overnight after that all of the Lawns
that made money from the first initial
play they will try to redistribute into
other sympathy play which is same sector
AI or whatever shipping companies those
stickers some of them have high floats
some of them have low floats some of
them have resistances and there will be
tickers that the money that's being
redistributed into those High floats
that has resistance that's your
opportunities to go in to take a large
short positions and make a tons of money
if you're a beginner make sure take
notes that every year that we will have
one of those seasonal trades that's
coming in maybe it will last longer AI
sounds like it will last for the whole
year and driven the entire tech stocks
for being very hot and we can see aisp
that was one s o n that was another one
those stickers are breaking out again
turning into a big multi Runners and
it's all following Nidia there also we
have some of the really hyped up tickers
like smci also following Nidia how to
not take losses on the FR side so here
are the few tips first of all is
whenever you are going going into a
boring season whenever you don't see a
very good trade in about 3 to 5 months
no top gers everything is boring
everything is being flat Market is going
down and that's where Traders are eager
to cash opportunity on the first few
trades that comes along interested in
trading like Steven Ducks it all starts

trading simply click the link in the
description below to get started now
let's dive back into the content every
time when it happens there is always a
tier that is exceptional going from 1 to
50 on the first few trades let's say
after 3 to 4 months you want to make
sure sizeing small or just observe
because you haven't placed a trade in
three to four months and you want the
opportunity to comes to you and you know
some of the people are eager to place a
trade you want to kind of get a hint of
the market how it's going and make sure
sizeing small or don't trade it uh wait
for the people not get squeezed first
because when people are making a mistake
and they're getting squeezed by tickers
like BMR or top like last year and the
mistakes that was made the money will
float to the Longs LS will create
opportunities for you to either go long
after the initial hype or go short
whenever you see a resistance those are
very good tips you need to have whenever
you try to survive the market as I said
the longer you survive the market the
better you will get and all those
seasonal trades for something that
ticket goes up to 1 to 100 1 to 200 you
will blow up a Trader entire career so
control your size whenever Market gets
really slow and just we transition from
a slow season to a h season always check
your statistics do not be formal because
you have to wait for the opportunity to
come to you you cannot go in and force
opportunities because the only time that
you profit the most is people are making
the biggest mistakes that's where I
personally in my career made my most
profits Something Like gme H fund I
screwed up I got squeezed short it too
much then we have dwac all those
stickers are the shorts made the biggest
mistakes we're transitioning from a slow
season to a hot season do not take a
trade if it's not necessary and wait for
the opportunity to come to you and
whenever you want to trade make sure
have a plan also make sure have all the
scenarios planned out if you are going
to take a losses after you take a loss
are you going to place a trade again so
have all the plans in the head that's
where you don't get surprised by how
much losses you being taken all right
guys that'll be it for this video just
share some of my thoughts trading
overall uh in the 2024 hopefully you
guys learned something in this video and
other than that I'll see you guys in the

[Music]
welcome to this video So today we're
gonna go over some of the articles that
happened in the last two weeks and I
also only give some of my personal
thoughts about how to really stay
disciplined and how to really stay
consistent profitable especially in this
really
um obviously low liquidity year and what
I've noticed uh from other Traders and
personally from my own reaction from
different uh I would say pattern
behavior let me share some experience
with you and other than that make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
and let's get into the video so today
I'm gonna go over two tickers one is
p-a-l-i one is e-d-e-u-d-a so uh p-a-l-i
and this is one of the tickers that I've
noticed uh it happens every single year
whenever you see a market cap that's
really low under I would say 5 million
or around 5 million and flow is really
low if it's considered to be a low float
it has to be below 3 million I want to 2
million it's approaching to Nano float
whenever you see a low market cap and a
nano flow typically the ticker tends to
spike a lot more compared to the Murray
cap is a lot bigger as I mentioned in
the previous video that if the market
cap is around 1 billion then it takes
another one billion to be injected into
the market cap to four this ticker to go
up 100 so as long as the market cap is
really low it needs much less Equity to
pop the stock up so whenever you're
looking at a five minute market cap that
means you're almost at the lowest market
cap in the NASDAQ and whenever the stock
performs a gap upshore And Trades tons
of wow in the pre-market you always want
to be careful with a massive squeeze
that's going to come in the morning is
because you know it doesn't really take
much for the Pumpers or for the people
to manipulate the stock for this one to
go up 100 200 percent in the morning uh
a deep look at p-a-l-i we have tons of
volume red candle right here shorted
against the pre-market high now
typically whenever you are looking at a
gap upshore with I would say 20 million
American cap with a three to five
million float and the stock pushes about
20 to 30 percent after market open
against the pre-market resistance that's
something that you can be considered Too
Short into into the strength but
whenever you see you are seeing a really
low market cap like five million market
cap at the very beginning or even two to
three million market cap and also you
are looking at really low flow always be
really careful I will not sure anything
that's I would say less than 100 now
gapped up in the uh in the pre-market so
this is one of the very uh I would say
small details you have to pay attention
to in the future wise uh do not touch
anything that's I would say
um murky copies are under 5 million and
it's up less than 50 in the pre-market
and also International flow so um pli
this is uh something you want to stay
away from and once the performance is
consolidation
um if it's trading I would say 80
million 100 million shares in during the
day I would not consider to be touching
this I would like to see in the next day
uh pre-market I can actually do a bond
estimate compared to the yesterday's
volume uh if the ratio is around one to
ten let's say today traded around 100
million then next day in the pre-market
traded around 1 million so the bond
estimated for the entire day should be
10 million the ratio will be 10 to 1 and
that's very good to shortening to so for
Pali this type of trend happens again
and again the reason why it went from a
two to almost six up 300 in just few
candles is because a lot of people are
very I would say eager to rush into a
ticker that's tradable and uh we haven't
had any place for a while so this will
make them precisely much bigger and
they're so I would say they are feeling
fomo that they were likely to miss the
spike and this is what happens all the
time on low market cap tickers that
trade tons of volume so that's my
thoughts on p-a-l-i hello guys David
here uh I will be holding a conference
in late February and I will be giving
out the strategies that made me over
eight figures between 2020 to 2022 and
also some updates about the strategies
that I created back in 2018 to 2019 of
course the market condition has changed
and also I will be giving out a discount
for Trader's Edge which is the upcoming
new course there's only going to be
discount for this conference
specifically and if you're interested
make sure to join the conference and
it's going to be a very interesting time
to learn about the strategies that's
going to play out in the slow market and
also we are going to review when the
market comes back just like 2021
uh this is a euda overall it traded
about 1 10 million shares in the entire
day I traded on Friday so the market
only opened about four hours and the
trend on this one
let's take a look at the entire uh
history of the chart nothing happened
until on Friday actually around 10
million shares so this is a fish chart
whenever you see a consistent
downtrending candle like this you always
want to be careful with crazy candle
actions typically a one can can pop
almost one dollar if the ticker has been
staying consistent down trending for you
know a month or a year the longer the
time period the more aggressive the
spike will be so for euda this is
something that you will see whenever the
chart performs consistent down trending
then you will see a really aggressive
spike in the morning
so uh the way to trade this I would say
whenever you see a take her face about
50 after uh the massive Spike uh you can
shorten to the bounces risk the 75
percent of the top uh normally for also
you can potentially risk on the top will
be five dollar typically these step
takers do not perform double top my risk
management when I'm trading the sticker
I will probably short into the 50 area
around 4.5 risking the 4.8 dollar area
so I will cut I will sets down half and
cut in full around five dollars and this
should be a really small trade
um I would say if the balance around 10
million that you shouldn't be sizing in
over over 50k shares so you know on
average maximum should be 30k shares uh
if he says convert 50k shares I'm in one
bounce it's not really worth it and the
risk potential is a lot bigger compared
to the I was the downside so uh those
are the two tickers that happened in the
last two weeks uh hopefully you guys
learned about
the Press actions and how the market is
really giving our place to all those
retail Traders and as I said
the lower the equality and that makes
Traders I would say a lot more eager to
jump into different plays and it makes
them to make mistakes so always be
patient and pay attention to the details
that'll be it for this video thank you
very much for watching I will see you
guys in the next one

have this one calculator that supposed
to be the perfect trader. So what I'm
supposed to do, what I'm supposed to
make and is this loss actually
necessary? So that sheet that I track is
pure based on robotic trading and not
emotional trading. So I compare myself

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
all right
what's up guys my name is Steven Dougs
uh in this video there will be no car no
houses no fancy stuff right showing um
I'm going to explain uh how did I made
three million dollars before age of 24
and what is my exact journey I went
through so at the very beginning I came
here as exchange student from China
I think when I was 16 years old so I
went to the high school uh United States
and at the beginning my English is not
very good so
and learning
anything or learning anything that based
it with English is very very difficult
for me so the only thing that doesn't
have uh English based is math so that's
why that's probably Asians are really
good with math because they don't need
anything based with English and also um
typically in Asia they have higher
standard with math so that's why when
they come here with the same age they
can do math a lot better anyway that's
that so at the beginning I went to the
high school here I wasn't very very good
with English so
at the first High School I actually got
kicked out so I transferred to another
High School uh started my high school
journey and after that I graduated now
the first year I went to the college and
started looking into something that have
a decent income either a stock market
real estate I have took a look of all
those factors before and basically for
me I'm international student I'm not
very good with English especially on the
lawyer side and uh and also with that
all those Federal attacks and involved
with real estate so I'm not very good
with that because I'm not very good with
communicate with other people with a
different language so I put the real
estate away and I went in with the stock
market so
at the beginning when I look at the
stock market now
yes it will take a long time to learn
all these terms and uh
how to read SEC filings how to read
10k10qs but all those after I learned
for a while I can just stare at the
computer I don't need to communicate
with other people so
it's not a communicate based during the
business so that's why at the beginning
I chose stock market then the real
estate now people looking at me think
okay you turned 27 000 into three
million dollars in three years and I
think that's all based on your talent no
it's not because when I started I don't
even know what stock market is and I
know what stock market is but I don't
know what what's the term how to call
them in English so uh
um after starting the market and I have
to go through all the terms learn what
line chart is what Candlestick chart is
I started from very very beginning so a
lot of people wants to go through guides
and stuff but at the beginning as a
beginner I think you should go with uh
Google anything you don't know just
Google and watch some YouTube videos and
it's really really helpful that's why I
do some YouTube video
tutorials for some new beginners and
give a current market instructions and
to let people know why should I should
be doing what should be not doing so
let's jump back uh at the beginning so
uh after I graduated from high school
and I will start looking at okay how do
I get into the market so I found a
couple mentors uh there is Tinker
Italian there's Tim Sykes there's uh
investor underground there's other
mentors and I basically purchased other
tutorials and start looking things
through
so what I always believe is now all the
educational materials that are not very
clear so now why do I say that because
now in high school or grade school or
even in college and some of the classes
are
are not very useful for your major you
just basically you're you're basically
taking them for the credit right so
uh to be able to graduate so there's a
ton of time that it was wasted and now
you can learn something else uh or you
can do something else so in the high
school I want to save as much as uh I
want to save a lot of times to play the
video games because
if I can learn the core thing of what
the lecture was taught and I can shrink
them down to learn them in a really
short amount of time so I can save all
those rambling stuff and people talking
about their personal experience so I can
save all that time to place to play more
a little bit uh video games and London
go to the college and if I can learn of
the core thing really fast I can expect
I can save time to learn more about
stock market how to invest so basically
I was doing that uh
at the first year when I got into
college so my first year was engineering
and basically the concept of engineering
is to make stuff sufficient as possible
so now you want to achieve
um 100 efficiency in a really short
amount of time so that's the concept
that I'm getting and it's really getting
close to the concept that I was learning
from
uh in high school because I want to save
time play video games I want to save
time during the stock market in the
college
so that concept that I also applied in
the market so at the first time when I
was started
I was learning a bunch of stuff
spy how to how to trade ETFs uh how to
trade painting stocks how to long-term
investing and all the things I look
through is
in stock market you can start with 100
two thousand dollars two thousand
dollars there is no amount of
invitations but in a real estate you
need credit score uh you need a based
amount of money if you can't get loans
uh basically to buy into properties it's
really it will take a long time for all
those funds to come back so you
basically your Equity are stuck in a
household so the the return of the
rental property will be a much slower
than if you take a loan from the bank
then you basically can put down 20 then
in about two years all those 20 will
come back then you can just use the rent
to pay off the loans so I think uh if
you don't have a credit score your type
down Equity will be really really bad
for your rental properties so that's
basically what I think of real estate
that's really uh really hard for college
students so I basically just went into a
stock market now as I mentioned my
English wasn't that good so it took me a
long time to really learn all those
terms
um and I applied the engineer concept
into the stock market and some of the
gaming strategy as well so I used to
play uh a game called Starcraft 2 and
there's a bunch of strategy involved and
there's a bunch of um combinations of
different units to counter your opponent
unit and in the in the market it's
pretty much the same because in
different situations you can use
different strategy to counter the
majority of people are doing so there's
statistics that
stock market was showing 90 people lose
money in the market the reason why I
think
of that is if you can do 90 of the
people that don't do
and you can basically put the opposite
uh
positions to against them then you
should be that 10 of the people to make
money
and now as a beginner uh the mistakes
I've been making is probably in this 90
of the people making the same mistakes
as me so at the beginning I write down
all the mistakes that I made I put them
on the wall remind me what I shouldn't
do what I should do
so in a long time a practice uh I can
kind of tell
what kind of criteria to look for
different stocks and if you meet my
criteria I should go and if I if I
didn't make my criteria I should not go
in and the market there's a bunch of
emotion are involved because when I
started training stocks especially a
stock is going up and up and up and up
and start doing parabolic there's no
pullback or no red candle I want to go
in because I think the stock is going to
go higher but when I as soon as I chased
in I am I'm with the 90 people who lose
money so as soon as I chase there and
start drops and I'll I will be basically
that money
so
I note that that markets are really
really heavy lean towards to trading
psychology so you can really learn from
if you can really know what other people
are doing you can basically creating a
strategy to counter the rest of the
people and that's also really related to
what uh one of the gaming because you
have to think of different counter
strategies to counter your opponent and
also with the engineering concept that
you want to make uh statistics you know
you know back testing all the strategies
so I basically created a huge amount of
spreadsheets that
record different trading strategies to
see if they really work because if you
want to make a machine to work you have
to test a thousand times ten thousand
times to make sure there's no incident
to make sure there is uh what's the
percentage of the fail rate then you
have the confidence to sell this machine
to use this machine to other people
um now that's exactly what I applied
into the market that's exactly how I
approached the market and so basically I
use psychology I use data and combine
them together to create a really high
winning percentage profit of strategy
um
after about I think or three months of
study uh because I think because of the
concept that I learned from the gamings
or the
engineering on the statistics
and you you grow my account and it also
massively increased my winning
percentage uh to almost 85 85 percent
per trade
then later on this year I filtered all
my batteries so each year I'll be keep
I've been keep improving so now people
because I have been this game for a
solid about three years now people think
there's a great risk involved with stock
market either day trading they're swing
trading or their long-term investing so
long-term investing has less risk
because
Google Amazon
uh Alibaba they're all huge market caps
so they have fundamentals they have
a bunch of equity so they were they're
not going to lose it in one day right so
slow investing in those markets that can
grow your account but it doesn't really
grow your account aggressively so that's
why
I picked day trading and swing trading
some of the tickers can go a thousand
percent two thousand percent
but
I can't catch a thousand percent two
thousand percent it's like a lottery
there's a specific strategy that
involved in it you can only catch about
50 on the downside maybe 60 on upside if
I can catch that predictable move then
my account can grow a thousand times per
year or two thousand times per year
that's why the first year I turned a 27
000 into I think it was 900 in the first
year the key is to really learn from
what other people are thinking because
stock market when the candles are moving
back and forth people are trading there
people who are behind computer are
trading they're creating those moves so
once you can learn
the move they're going to make they
encounter the move they're going to make
then you can make money so that's
basically why 90 people lose money ten
percent people make money and also stock
market can grow your small Equity very
very aggressively I think there's risk
involved in but at the first year I'm in
college I have nothing to lose I only
have that much money in my pocket and I
basically just dive dance want to learn
more because later on
I won't I will have kids then I'm not
afford to lose what I have now but I can
afford to lose when I'm in college
because I don't have that much to lose I
basically just want to gain as much
experience as possible but it turns out
give me a great return let me give that
a really simple explanation uh when I
start playing a video game it took me a
six years to grow from the bottom to the
top one percent of the entire world and
it took me literally seven years of
practice and in the market I basically
spend a lot more time in the video games
it took me about three years to slowly
learning from mistakes slowly learning
why should what should I be doing what
should I not to be doing how to control
emotions how to really do risk
management uh
how to not
Chase into other huge spikers when other
people are chasing
that's where you have um
where other people are chasing so it's a
really difficult learning curve but
anything that you want so if you want to
be successful it really takes time as
myself for example English is not my
first language I'm learning a completely
new market
and at the beginning I spend about eight
hours a day studying to learn different
terms how to re SEC that's the worst
part and how to learn technical analysis
fundamental analysis uh what Market Zone
shouldn't be trading what I'm not sure I
should be trading
um
it's not about learning from other
people you want to accumulate all the uh
useful stuff and to combine them and to
put them into your head to create your
own strategy that's that's exactly what
I've been doing for the past three years
then I just created more sufficient
strategies within these three years
each year I've been keep improving
improving improving and later on I think
I will be much better and can get
involved into other businesses like real
estate because I do have a funds to be
able to get into that market now
so for all the other viewers out there
if you want to be good at something you
have to save your mind into it to put
enough hours into it and it takes time
because nothing in this world can really
make you rich quick even like the stock
market
now your your amount of money or amount
of wealth equal how much work you put it
in because
when I was studying I was studying
Non-Stop and wasn't very healthy because
I was learning when I'm showering and
learning when I'm going to the bathroom
um and end of the day
I got what I wanted but
like my health went really really so I
wasn't really healthy I think I got like
stomach ulcer for like two months so
that wasn't really good but I think it's
worth the effort anyways I hope this
video really motivates you uh this is my
really personal uh stories for my
trading journey and I do have my own
Education Service now because I want to
put all the useful information out there
for people to even learn even faster
because
uh I have went through all other mentors
like some of them 90 of them are uh not
very useful and you basically have to
dig through so many of lessons to be
able to find something that is useful to
put in your notebook so
um now the concept of reason why I
created this Educational Service because
I want to gather all the useful
information out there so you are not
gonna so you are not going to be like me
to put to to Really spend so much time
to find all those useful informations
and basically if you learn from this
system and you will learn a lot more
faster than other people who spend years
out there like me uh and spending 10
hours a day trying to figure it out and
spend 10 8 hours a day in front of the
market watching the market to think
about okay why did why this pattern
happens what's the what's the psychology
behind it it's all figured out so if
you're interested uh click the link

very much for hearing my stories I hope
you guys have a great day

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let's go guys Steven duck sir in this
video we're gonna talk about how I
really turned 40 K into 300 K in one
month and I have to go back there's
gonna be a little bit story about it
because at that time I was already up
around I think I'm energy already in
this video I want to show you how you
can really increase your maximum again
so using a really small town before this
I wanna say at March there was a really
hot market and there's all kinds of
stuff going on so in pinion stocks it's
relatively pretty hot and I did get up
to knees so I there's gonna be no BS I'm
going to show March account statement
and you can go in and can either
download my account statements you can
see every single trade so you can really
see my performance and this will make a
huge difference compared to other girls
that doesn't really verify their trades
it don't show their councilman's ever
and they say they made a median or 200 K
in a month but the neighbors over the
actual counseling's and that leads to
every single trade how many shirts they
executed and what time so in this count
statement it will show you what date in
my time and how they're trading is a
sure wrong so every single thing is
released to the public
let's get into a story I was talking to
my friend and he lost a bunch of money
in the stock market before and it did he
didn't know how to really trade and he
didn't know there's multiple sectors in
the market and what he did it just
investing blue chip stocks and made
money in there and most money in there
and eventually came down he lost about
200k I told him okay well how about we
make a bet I will invest about 40k by
myself if I won by the end of the
mountain fake an increase of my account
about 50% you give me the 40k and you
lose 20k at that time my friend was
really interested and he was a really
trust in penny stocks it wasn't really
trusting me or getting very skeptical
about the whole entire sector I was
doing the trade and he will probably
watch my trades every single day and by
the end of the month I turned forty
thousand into two hundred ninety two
thousand and that's about four hundred
percent of increase and that just blowed
his mind and he
are thinking how he can really invest in
the market and how mark is not a
completely gamble the message I really
used on this 40k account is not normal
he is not really for people who has that
concise so the method I used to go to
this account is if the stock is at $5
and I'm shooting a pro kleh night so I'm
risking about 20 cents and if I place
10,000 shares that would be like 48,000
right so bond risk in 2000 but 48
thousands already over my account size
so at that time it didn't really hit my
maximum loss I'm still 6k from my
maximum loss so I increased my position
size into instead of 200k I'm still
risking 6k so I have a 200,000 position
risk in 6k but that's a really high risk
management and if you're not very
familiar in the market I wouldn't
release it just to do it but that way I
can maximum profit I minimize my losses
and max my profit and at that time I was
making a hundred K per trade over 200 K
portrayed just for the skin I used
leverage but I'd minimize my losses into
a very limited range if I went out
traded say I made another 50k so I will
increase my maximum loss into let's say
10 K and I was still using the maximum
gain method to increase my account size
so I was playing this game I wasn't
really care how much money I make but
end of the mountain I made around 290 mm
there will be a lot of method going to
it there's going to be obviously a gap
down up into the top and shooting into
low flows and the mistakes I made also
in there so you will show all the trades
in there and make sure to click the link
bell you will take you there you
register your email and we'll send you
the account statements tickety's to look
at it and see what you can learn hope
you guys will enjoy the content that I
put out for free and that'll be the end
of the video thank you very much you
guys have a good

SOURCE VIDEO: How I have made $120,000 in 2 hours (Dux Weekly Runner Analysis) [QXCHlmSe7IU].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys Steve inductor on today
I'm gonna go over some of the tickers
that happen on Friday
tnx P and T and X so here's the
screenshot that I made the trade on
Friday the ping point is the entry point
the Greens to cover point so my average
is right around a six point forage in
the cover in the low three and high two
ish so in total I made around 120,000 of
the trade happened between 9 a.m. to 11
a.m.
[Music]
[Applause]
and between 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. so that's
about 1 hour and a half and those
situations they don't happen that often
because with intraday offering they
happen maybe 10 times a year when the
stock is on down train insanity annexed
so it's really where we see those two
intraday offerings that happens on the
same day so now there's a difference of
the pattern on T and X P and T and X T
and X P of course is about short and in
the pre-market on the sake of talking to
the nines and chopped around and started
at the morning push but he didn't rate
that much volume so I don't know what's
going on in the free market and that
basically used $7 asthma risk and then
already all the way down so the internal
offering and ecology is if I didn't do
offer and maybe I've made around fifty
thousand but I did offer I made around
hundred twenty T and X it doesn't really
have any other resistance before so you
had this consolidation resistant you
know six ish and and start pushing into
the fights and failure though so you
start working from down training in
there and it did offering and went all
the way to one point four let me explain
some points are really important so
we're already low money tap something
like two million or under five under 10
million if he is trading maximum on and
still stays on low market app especially
under ten million it's really dangerous
to shorten into so T and X and T and X P
is a completely different story because
P and X P is over at least ten million
and if the market cap is under 10
million in spring a mass amount of
volume it's really easy to manipulate
the stock that stock can push will be
higher than you think
so that's why I didn't touch the index
if they didn't do offering this this
perk might get to stock really choppy I
don't feel a loss if I miss to your next
but I stayed really disciplined
I was thinking touching DX but I didn't
so if you get shorted it congratulations
txp did a mass amount offering you
have some more bounces in the future I
don't know yet so we'll see this $7
resistance and probably thought that
becomes an art of existence as well
because they're offering a five so a lot
of people stucked at five and people are
trying to dip by this um really really
took a loss when you started offering
before they will always do the second
time they walk was to your secondary
offering especially on jump when you
sucks so when they do offer him before I
need to do a reverse split it already
proves the company in sketchy and if the
common sketchy
don't try to dip buy it intraday or on
already down training chart because they
are really easy to get holiday if
they're pushing it too high
it's already easy to get you top all
today almost all hold T 1 T 2 T 12
they're pretty bad for planes that get
very hot it is most likely offering and
you were they already see well after the
haul the stock goes to thousand percent
or two hundred percent you happen before
if it's packed with shorts and starts
being dumped ringing for a while I'm
really really slowly for example like
the RAS that happened last November T
and next no resistance in the 10 a.m. to
12 a.m.
between consolidating so it's really
American market cap and can be really
manipulated if you traded it you might
get lucky and they did offering but if
you trade the next time the odds will
not be an aside in trading is more like
to stay young disciplined because when
you see Tian Xing you're thinking you
missed how much money if you are sure
but the next time you will go in a lot
bigger and then you think you are going
on T and X because we think TX owns you
money then that will curry a big
disaster for your account
it's more about patient it's more about
staying disciplined in the last two
weeks I think I've been taking small
offices here and there two thousand
three thousand two thousand two thousand
I was giving a bit frustrated but I
always stay disciplined because in every
single year there's always appear of
amount of time that you always start to
get frustrated because your pattern is
now working for two or three weeks your
in small asses gradually so always be
patient let the opportunity comes to you
because most of people will blow up
their account in that two or three weeks
because I'll keep taking losses and
there they want to make the losses back
and the hammer in your tray that is
shouldn't be in then they took another
loss so the emotional chain reaction
will actually destroy our account I
think that is the most difficult period
of time to try to overcome in trading
career that I have experienced so that
is all my thoughts on T and X P and T X
and T and X P just made around 120,000
and if they manage to feast and probably
117 117 thousand yeah that is all my
thoughts on T X P and T X so if I want
to learn more about balance or gap
upshore how do you really trade in two
mornings bags click the link below we're
doing a holiday sale or trading
techniques around here to Yuri sub yeah

SOURCE VIDEO: How I have made 76K in 1 month (Past Trades Explained) [8cbxaAHQTRU].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys - dr. welcome to this
week new YouTube video lessons and today
we're going to talk about my may Matthew
performance and as you can see I've made
around 72,000 on the net profit right
round here and I paid around $4,000 in
commissions
I mean this finally it's pretty slow and
compared to April well April is even
slower and i only made around 40k
April's there's very no trace in April
and in this month is a little bit better
I think was in the middle of the month
there's basically nothing to trade and
also this week and also I'm going to
talk about some of the trades you
shouldn't take and how do you really
stay consistent profitable most of the
setup I says Amen I always ask myself
well what kind of pattern am i trading
if it meets my setup I'll go in if it
doesn't I will stop trading and close
computer close to platform and debate
for the rest of the day and that's how I
be able to stay consistent or profitable
because you don't really need to stick
in front of computer for 24 hours were 9
to 8 hours you only need to stay about
like 4045 minutes to 2 hours to look at
the market if a the play fits your
criteria go ahead and play if it doesn't
skip it because most of the active stops
only happens in the first 45 minutes so
you can make all your judgments in
before market opens around 9:25 to 9:20
if there's no ticker that gaps around
over 20% it means there's no movement we
cannot really set into any tickers that
doesn't really have any reward in this
case I did my best to cut my losses when
I see the ticket has huge support I
wouldn't really go ahead and size a name
so let me give you a discing examples so
right here it was the ticker that as so
why the signal was trading in like 22
million shares on the current day and I
started from 6 dollars before you trying
to make a judgement up anything go ahead
and I take a look at the 6 month chart
and to see is there any resistance or is
there any support if the charge is fresh
if is trading fresh volume this is the
first time the stock gets this much more
that means the stock is being towards to
the bullish direction and so on the
starting cap was around 98 million now
it's kept me up around three hundred
percent there's really no edge trading
this the only favourites on that Shore
so if you're shorting into this
consumption breakdown fish chart trading
this amount of volume you will always
get squeezed people don't really respect
the first screen day the second thing
I'm going to talk about salty okay so if
you look at the entire oto k-chart right
before it's about to spike around 60
million 40 million shares per day you
had nothing
there's no historical resistance there's
no consistent resistance there's only
around six minutes actually $18 area but
that's not really enough compared to the
daily volume of 40 million or 60 million
so you have to kind of tree OTL cares a
fresh chart now if you look at as a
multi-day runner if you okay closely in
15 days around 2 minutes and the chart
was forming really strange
so first Green Day gathering up push
squeeze and push again
so if you pick a close attention there
is a support around to 30 to 50 area
support around 260 270 area so when I
see people shorting in the 3:20 and you
think the stocks gonna go red and can't
break the support the thing it's not
going to break the support if the stock
is training that much volume 40 million
60 million shares a day there's enough
support to hold the stock and caused a
huge squeeze and start getting up and
now on this day the stock were in red
but I still didn't crack the support
this is the reason why I don't reassure
him too much the runner that have layers
of a support it's super difficult to
crack it needs mass amount of patience
to be able to swing this sometimes wound
doesn't really work if you swim for a
long time get to cover at 3.12 so it
basically didn't make any money for
those count occurs it's not worth it for
your attention so if you see those their
support and when people getting squeezed
they're saying the first screen or
second reading that they are feeling
revenged into the stop and they're
shorting into any push and when stock
hose right there are shorting again the
it doesn't really have really good risk
reward so i'll tok it's a no trade
same thing with plc if the stop trading
around let's say over fifty million
shares on a day or a hundred million
shares on the day i think this one treat
around 70 million shares yeah
so with the stock trading 70 million
shares on the day it's super difficult
to crack and it's super difficult to
trade since the stock is so crowded if
it's a low flow the spread gets huge and
if it makes them a major action stock
drops about like 10 20 percent on plc
there's no historical resistance if you
take a look there is some resistance
around 2:15 ish but it's not really that
heavy when it's actually that much room
volume of 70 million which is around two
times or three times of the original
volume or average volume you have to
kind of treat this ticker like a fresh
chart so anything that happened before
did not happen just treat it like the
stock is first time spiking so that's

here's the screenshot I'm around 50
$64,000 uh IPX
[Music]
what's up guys welcome to the new weekly
recap steaming ducks here today we're
going to talk about InP X which I made
around 66,000 I think there's other
trade I made remember to code but I'm
gonna go over you and you Xin
I'm Marv and I M RN sorry and I am px so
let's start with you Xin
not people are trading notes because
this is a series of extended insane
Massimo bring days but look at the
market cap it's two point four three
billion and that's not in our comfort
zone
very similar ticker which is called CR
Ellen it's a nice week sector it was
really extended above the cat Oboro
chart is super messy and takes so long
for a star to drop like 10% and 20% we
are treating this kind of market cap
zones you are expecting that same
behaviors from cion Taran has the best
market kept and you excitement so this
wings probably don't get more Messier
and it's very difficult to predict
what's going on we are shooting to a
first red day and there is no pattern to
it if it turns red and squeezing
afternoon after squeezes it goes red
then squeeze again so it gets really
frustrated and this is a legitimate
company more legitimate penny stocks
because this is an hour not you know
putting stuff areas ohms patterns and
how you read the trend supposed to be
really different so that's why a lot of
people being squeezed they don't know
what's going on in penny stock area most
of the ticker are around 15 million to
200 million sometimes i tree around that
on your media markup but really where d
on billion dollar market cap i don't
throw it out at all because I don't I
know
actually before I track the data before
it's not gonna work there you go short
all go long it's completely gamble and
average one spot like 50 percent when
you go into the market wanna gamble you
want high return 20 percentage patterns
and this is not some kind of ticker
issue trading you next I am TX this is a
micro flow with the release
market cap and see on the long-term
chart there's not enough resistance
overhead and it just did a reverse space
so once you do a reverse play the flow
supposed to be really low you are
expecting a massive morning spike so I'm
a really low flow ticker and you're
expecting at least 30% 40% morning push
found open and don't really shorten to
10 20 percent more in push because it's
likely to squeeze if you missed it you
go ahead mister play because those it
has to meet the perfect materia and the
trend has to trap enough bad holders for
it to be profit from this pattern and as
you can see the stock squeezed over five
you performed the breakout once they
come backs down it was a fake out so a
lot of people bought into this break I'm
trapped then you started from 5:30 went
all the way to $3 so on this trend I
showed it around 550 added when the
downturn confirmed which is all the
breakout pirates underwater then I
slowly covered in two witnesses I didn't
hold overnight because the Opera is very
terribly expensive so yeah that's the
trade for iron px now hey ma Ryan this
ticker was really weird because printing
stocks doesn't really go up that high so
this is a multi-tier runner and this one
will be eventually come back down so
first right there could be using this
pattern but he needs to accumulate long
robe on like 30 minutes falling into
form a consolidation over this
resistance before this ticker to start
have a downside because as long as the
stock stays green and it's choppy less
volume then always see just pure short
squeezes every single day and Carolee
buying two massive arresting gear
because even just 1 2 to 10 MRAM will be
the top watch for the next few days I'm
looking for massive volume of extinction
I will probably get into a swim position
after first red day pretty solid
hopefully this one goes really over soon
there's something like
twenty or thirty dollars so holiday
season's coming
and January is coming up as well a lot
of tax losses will be reported and
people are looking to raise money so
there's a lot more money petition going
on in January and February and please be
careful trade your perfect criteria
trade your perfect pattern if it doesn't
reach your criteria and make any of our
patterns don't even trade it close to
tab and enjoy your holidays so that's my
thoughts for this weekly recap hopefully
you guys learn something new here's the
screenshot a mere around fifty sixty
four thousand dollars I'm px and I
didn't trade I traded MRN and I have

[Music]
welcome to this video so uh the market
is back a little bit and I have made
100K last Friday so which is last week
uh there's several tickers I want to
talk about and they traded two tickers
one I made uh 10K when I made about 110k
so overall it's about 120k again minus
the barrel fee should be around 110.
so uh let's get into the tickers for the
review and before I start this video
make sure to click the like button and
subscribe and let's get into it
so uh we have three takers uh together
on Friday typically they don't come in
as three at the same time it's been uh
quite a while since we have a couple
takers that's going to a hundred some of
it around eight to ten dollars and let's
go over them one by one so we have hudi
this will be a potential play into the
next week if you take a look at the
overall chart stock basically went from
20 to 200 so uh I'm really low buying on
this for references you can check out
HKD in August I believe when the ticker
is trading really low volume without any
type of consolidations and it's pretty
much all on parabolic it's very
difficult to trade and it's also very
hard to get executed especially going
short or long so this one has got down
from 192 to 110 and uh we'll see how it
performs on on Monday you should
consolidate at some point once it loses
its momentum it should be a relatively
great short volume is not there but it
needs to trade at least five to ten
million before it it becomes a short but
otherwise if volume stays this low next
week try not to place a trade because
these type of low volume tickers can run
quite a while
then following we have sntg this is a
classic
Gap I'm sure that I haven't seen for a
while uh normally done in the previous
day when the takers spiked a little bit
and gaps up in the next day these type
of Gap up short becomes a little bit
more difficult than normal
um because whenever you have an after
hour Spike these type of levels on
consolidations normally becomes a
neutralized area so if it tends to spike
in the pre-market then the lowest of the
spike becomes the neutralized area but
if it starts to spike yesterday's
afternoon in and formed consolidation
that consolidation is much higher
compared to the pre-market initial point
where they started to spike so that's
for sntg uh this is a little bit more
difficult Gap upshore than normal but I
had a massive drawdown uh in pre-market
I don't think it was offering so it came
all the way back test the pre-market
High I took a civil short uh one was
around 5 30. one is 570 one is 560 so my
average was around 55 60 ish and they
pretty much
Consolidated all day and cracked in the
afternoon this one only fitted about 50
as I said that if the ticker tends to
spike in the afternoon
and that consolidation area becomes
neutralized area then the draw down
percentages only will be 50
typically if it starts to spike in a
pre-market it's around 75 so that's for
smtg then we have PK Bo this is a first
Green Day on and pretty much no history
at all then we had a weird pre-market
Spike lost all of its momentum
aftermarket open came all the way back
and didn't really crack in the afternoon
so this is also a classic first green
day typically these type of players are
not shortable first of all is when the
volume is building from the bottom which
is the stock started to spike from the
yesterday's neutralized area that means
the volume is start to increase at the
bottom of of this ticket so when the
vinyl start to build at the very low
lowest price of the neutralized area
typically these type of spiking ticker
are very difficult to short as you can
see the how the chart really performed
that already performed Consolidated all
day crafted in the afternoon came all
the way back so this will probably
continue on Monday likely to push over
10 10 then it should be a short either
on Tuesday or Friday a Tuesday or
Wednesday so those are the three tickers
I want to go over at and the sntg is
actually the first gap of short I've
seen for a while but it was a micro flow
so I didn't get to sizing as big as I
wanted to the volume is definitely
dropping typically on a 1 million follow
on five dollar taker it trades anywhere
between 15 million pound to 70 million
volume but on Friday only traded about
35 million volume in total so definitely
the liquidity is dropping so make sure
video really careful with your size and
also pay a good attention to the two
minute candlesticks because the volume
will tell you how much you can size it
how much you cannot typically you don't
want to exceed over than one percent of
the volume so that'll be of the recap
for all those stickers
um by the way we have a new uh course
that's going to come come out on
February and the pre-sale is going to
end Within
I think two weeks so make sure you grab
your chance to get the discount so thank
you very much for watching I will see
you guys in the next video

[Applause]
what's up guys welcome to the new
YouTube video of the week today I'm
gonna talk about my weekly performance
so in this week we had a lot of runners
not a low flow as well sympathies as
well and we also has some crazy
backfield patterns and la la gente c'è
college patterns as well so today I'm
going to talk about the psychology
behind day traders them how they react
in two different scenarios I'm going to
list some rules for beginners and also
I'm going to talk about my almost 60,000
win on Friday and I think I took a loss
on Tuesday and Thursday which is 3,000
and 6,000 and I had a massive game known
Friday because all those players are
seems so crazy if you don't have the
odds behind it so that's why I didn't
trade so let's start talk about why UCL
basically on this specific date flow
start rotating and there's a solid
breakout underneath it and start
squeezing from basically 1 to 17 you
know dead and when you look at the low
flow don't ever look at the percentage
game because that will never help you to
make your judgment on how there's
patterns supposed to react as I
mentioned before 60 percent maximum
squeezing percentage so you can if you
can see squeezed from the 3 to 5 times
all except 5 squeeze about 960 percent
to roughly $8 ish and start moving back
and forth and parabolic to 10 screws
about under 60% to 13 now the 60% move
doesn't exactly work on all those really
micro flow because they react
differently there's a lot of people
behind it with big size and you will
never know on the first screen there
when will they cover over where they saw
their positions so no day one never
touch on the short side and especially
we will see the stock is up like four
hundred five hundred percent you can go
a thousand two thousand percent so you
will never know how high the ball goes
sometimes I see 200 150 you know day so
that's something that you need to be
really careful with those
microflora and i will suggest to wait
until day three day four to short it
because that's where in their backside
start to show up if the stop gap
happening second day and you didn't go
red then that's a no short as well
because once the microflora starts on
green it's really difficult for them to
go red he doesn't take that much money
for them to go ring to staggering
so people who behind it who manipulate
it can take a vantage of all those short
sellers squeezing the stock and sell
them into strength so those things you
can't control
just stay away from it and wait until
day three day four to short it and
that's my only suggestions for micro
flow and first green day if it starts to
flow to L prefer long than short you've
got shows that are avoid this place and
if you see the stock is up with no
reason or no news don't touch as a
non-biased because as we see POA g that
halted on Friday wins parabolic in I'm
sure this one more end up really badly
typically drops about 50 to 70 percent
once open so never try to chase all
those microflora without a reason people
seem to have this kind of mentality if
the one stock starts to spiking and once
they fall off the cliff and there's
another stock with a similar market cap
and flow they will started spiking again
so they used ye Co mentality too long on
P o AG but purity was up without any
reason he was going semi and if you get
car based on all those hots
or if you chase into massive strength
you can't really get easily halted and
you're down to 70 percent and can you
bend sell because there's no line
there's no equity in the middle so the
opens at four but what you're gonna do
you're just gonna sell your positions
and down seventy percent so that is the
risk of micro flow especially holding
overnight chase massive strength and a
show sir don't chase into strength based
on percentage you have to chasing based
on pattern
never short on a micro flow on the first
swing day that's extremely important and
make sure follow that rule because all
those people who trade air the last week
either they had a massive game with
either they put up their account or they
took a really big loss so Sam psychology
goes to PTI so PTI had a huge job which
was like three hundred four hundred
percent the volume which the voluntary
muck is insane it was traded ten million
in America so that considered little bit
too much volume for me I think I showed
it in a six thirty
I'm covered in six eighty s assume that
see the strength I'm gonna say I'm gonna
try the entire day after that loss I
think was down six thousand I think I
showed it 10 K once the stock performs
gothfield or stays super crowded trades
over 100 million shares a day and that's
the sign for you not to touch it you
down the first green day on a second
green day because once the stock gets
crowded it becomes really calm
predictable it's really hard to pick up
entry except they have a massive
dropping a couple minutes so that's
something you have to be aware of once
the bomb start get crowded start going
to trade one hundred million shares a
day
I typically completely stay away from me
on the first day to be on a second as
well so more preferred on biased and
short and symptom don't judge by the
stock gaining message look for a pattern
instead of looking for the stock board
again the five hundred percent oh it's
up too much I'm gonna short it that's
not how it works especially on this
really hot market so PT I was one of the
very good examples that Boeing was super
crowded start treating maximum volume
and the state really polish on a day and
NCT UI which is very similar as sim
gaining percentage temp PTI those two
had similar getting percentage and those
people who are beginners I'm looking at
the same tickers they say okay yesterday
on the persimmon from front prism to six
hundred percent so today I'm expecting
and city like them from a foreign person
go up to X eight hundred percent because
the flow is lower but NCT Y is a little
bit different because the market cap and
a florist Avenue the range of our
trillions
pti over 300 million market cap that's
not typically the penny stock ring -
it's really showing to your to be
trading to you once the volume gets
crowded volume always overwhelmed short
sellers and they can't eat choice errors
arrive and they always have a really
messy chart and cty they do have
resistance before the stock was not
treating that much following mine is the
one of the really important indicators
for in City WA and GTI because volume
decide how much buyer or show the stock
what's the potential flow rotation will
happen in the current day and so if you
liked it naturally damage volume I was
jacked enough brightening and people who
chased Brian you think is going to
perform PGI
and it didn't happen that way so if the
people think the stock is going to
bullish extremely because they see the
example before and when once they see a
bearish sign which is very bearish so a
poli-sci and turning to Versailles and
buyers will get more nervous because
they're not expecting what they're
expecting they think the stock is going
to tend buy the stock instead of dropped
to 7 and the typically certain pressure
will be harder than normal because it's
out of their expectation now a bearish
pattern people short it because they
know they're gonna come down and to
compare with the bullish sign turning to
bearish sign and the better sign stays
on bear sign typically the bully sign
turning to bearish sign the selling
pressure is a little bit harder than the
person keeps being bird sign so that's
the little bit difference that's why I
NC - I dropped so much harder than
compared to PGI
because it's out of people expectations
and dropped almost 100% of its own game
so that's why I took a huge revenge on
NC gy and I made about 42,000 now and
city UI and ad in the middle to go
advantage as well I made about 60,000
56,000
by the end of the day and that's my
general thoughts of interview and PGI
now let's talk about sympathy plays so
sympathy plays they're up without reason
because they have the same a sector
which is
or Chinese stats so people who see the
Chinese stocks going up they always
think okay
CCC L is it also Chinese stock and
because I'm to lay down why you see us
I'm going to choose a CCL that's what
all those same sector stock spiked at
the same time and they also follow each
other as well so somebody pretty
typically drops harder and they don't
have a reason for it despite because
they don't have the news so when they
started losing this moment and drops
about 100 100 percent of its own gain so
into the next week
they already formed a huge amount of
resistance on Thursday and Friday
there's going to be a lot of puncture
opportunities that can basically give
you 20% to 30% again you want trade so
that is all my thoughts about sympathy
plays typically into psychology on PT
a-- and cty and if you understand what I
just explained and leave a comment if
you understand anti psychology side on
PT a-- and CT y and tell me how you
think I will try to do those longer
explanation YouTube video as much as
possible hopefully is helpful and if you
learn more details about bonjour capture

those patterns click the link below and

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys steve next here welcome to
this new youtube episode today i'm going
to talk about the 200 000 that i made
on thursday on sunw and i'm going to
generally talk about the overall market
and how did it really come back and also
the leading ticker
spi as well and why i didn't really
trade it and how am i supposed to look
at
the market trend after this week so
before i get into the specific tickers i
want to talk about the general mindset
behind short sellers and people who are
looking for
opportunities to catch and when we're in
a boarding season a lot of people
want to make money and they think market
owes their money
as well so we've seen the markets being
really really boring nothing is really
happening
and a lot of people are eager to make a
trade we're right at the transitions
right now
if you are impatient and want to make a
trade that's where you are creating
opportunity
for people who are patient enough to
make money from
overall you will create this effect that
as soon as the opportunity decides to
come
they will tend to size a much bigger
size
[Music]
and that type of mentality normally
leads to a much bigger volume and much
stronger squeeze
which you see on spi and pretty much all
the similar
energy sector starts to follow as well
which i
majorly focus on the sympathy play
rather than the major play
so let's dive into the intro hr and try
to figure it out
which one is more predictable and which
one's not predictable at all
so let's look at su and w and spi
both of them went up pretty much um
500 percent or above in one day uh su w
went up
over 800 percent spi over was around
four thousand to five thousand percent
something really ridiculous
uh starting around one and let's look at
how did it really become this type of
large squeezer and how to really find
the stock start to lose its momentum
so first of all when the stock was
gapping up it was up around 200 percent
i personally shorted around 380 to
360-ish
and as soon as i saw it's been holding
the support twice or third time and
decided to come up and break the
day high that's where i started cutting
my losses
overall i lost very small i think it was
around
20 cents to 30 cents on a three dollar
stock so
less than 10 percent one of the small
details you have to notice
is when the stock tends to crack its own
support as soon as it cracks
if it doesn't really move at all that
means the stock has the strength in
there
and it's likely to come back and hold
the support and potentially squeeze
again
if you notice the very detail here the
support is at 3.32
you cracked it the 3.32 into 3.30
so cracked about two cents held again
then came back and break the date high
that's where you're supposed to cut your
losses
whenever you see a gap up shore and
it's trending down and didn't really
lose too much percentage compared to the
entire again
in the morning uh normally about 15 to
10 pullback
and come back and break the day high
that's something you have to be really
careful because
as soon as you're sizing in are not
really focused on any type of pattern
because as soon as it breaks its day
high it does not count
as a gap of short anymore so in this
case i didn't really trade after 10
15 took a long break i was still
watching because the stock is trading
way too much volume compared to normal
normally stock trade around 30 to 50
million shares is considered really
crowded
but for spi it traded about 120 million
shares in the first hour alone
and that's something you have to put in
back of your head to really think about
how much fun you can trade it throughout
the entire day
normally 30 to 50 million volume trading
the first hour
likely trade about 150 million to 200
million a day
so once you notice that spi was trading
120 million shares in the first
hour or two you kind of have to stop
placing orders because when the stock is
reaching maximum volume
in one day that's where stock becomes
extremely
unpredictable it's likely to produce
some type of squeeze like this
start spiking around 10 and went all the
way almost to 50
and that's where discipline comes from
because if a pattern doesn't work you
have to cut your losses
if you just stare at it and wish it to
come back
and if it doesn't happen then it's
likely to blow your account
so spi i took a loss in early 30 minutes
but after that
didn't really trade at all with it until
the next day and i was looking for the
major resistance
on yesterday intraday chart so the first
bounce went from 19 to 30.
i was using 30 as my guide to short into
but
i was hoping that it could perform like
kodk form a 30 to 35 consolidations
for me to really find and get my risk
ready tight so i would be able to
get a decent amount of risk award but in
this case
spi didn't really give the opportunity
he just faded
through the entire day and didn't really
give any type of bounce
for potential entry because if it can
only drop to about 12
to 13 which i was using yesterday's low
as a guide as well
and you are shorting around 22-23
there's much more risk compared to
reward
so that's not very ideal i was waiting
until next day
su w decides to spike again so this one
was much easier to predict because i
have some type of resistance in the
pre-market for me to look up to
for spi i have resistance in pre-market
but didn't really give me the chance to
enter
so su w i have a guide around 8.5
and 8 ish and i was waiting for stock
to come up and test a seven and eight
dollar area for me to
find a resistance for me to shoot into
now
there's some mistakes that i made in the
early 30 minutes because i was
trying to shore into i think it was
around
high six to seven and the common losses
uh because i don't really know where
it's going to top
and i tried that about two times i was
getting a little frustrated
because it's likely to break through
this 850
around the 10 15 ish you look really
strong
on the level two area i patiently waited
until the stock formed its own
resistance at 8.5 ish
and shorted around seven and held for
the entire day didn't really hold
overnight because borrow was kind of too
expensive
made about i think it's around 30 to 40
percent on my trade
overall it's around 200 000 yen i think
i should hold overnight because
as soon as it hit the four dollar area
fading from 8.5 to 4
the stock is still up around 200 percent
so there's still plenty of reward for me
to get
personally i don't really like holding
overnight and also
you know the borrow fee can potentially
stack up if the overnight fee
was times seven or times five and that's
some type of cost you kind of have to
take in considerations
overall i didn't really catch majority
of the move i only caught about su and w
normally in a really heavy crowded
stocks it's really
difficult to make money in that specific
day especially on the first day when the
hype started to happen
and that's where everybody wants to get
in and
you're basically waiting for the first
wave of people making their mistakes and
you can clearly see their mistakes
to take out advantage from their
mistakes and that's
one of the fundamentals you kind of have
to follow when you are
trying to become a consistent profitable
trader and that's very important
so that will be all my thoughts on my
200 000 game
for this week i think i only placed
about two to three trades on the same
taker didn't really trade anything else
not very ideal didn't really give me the
ideal criterias
so hopefully you guys have been stay
disciplined and
this recap should help you learn about
how to really treat
a boiling season how to really
transition from boring season into a
hotter season
and that will be end of this video thank
you very much for watching and i will
see you guys in the next one

doctor huh welcome to my new video
lessons of the week and today we're
gonna talk about some of the play that I
missed some place I actually catch so
MPV has been half a few days and had a
massive drop on Friday I think I was
actually long in the three fifteen years
sold in the three forty turns out to be
had a lot of upside I couldn't catch on
bills I didn't catch on a downside as
well I did mention in my chat room that
I would sure in the nine eight year
close to ten because this is open range
of ten to seven which is about twenty
percent drop but now I was afraid of
this seven fifty one hundred miniature
traded so this part supposed to acting
as a support and that's where I'm a
little bit nervous that the stop can
have a massive drop in can be trapping
the shorts in a 70/50 area and rate
break ten and studying the new high
because the star has been trapping for a
while and the stocks trading hundred
miniatures a day on 150 miniatures a day
so I haven't actually traded all those
hundred million share trading stocks I
don't have that much data on it so I
have to need to be more conservative
that on the stocks I don't trade that
often because we're trading billion
dollar market cap T o ry and CRO and all
those things are that a bunch of hedge
funders are involved in so something
like unbe Evie it's more favored to our
little traders but I'm still not
familiar with this volume so on now the
staff had a massive downside on Friday
and I'm hoping there's going to be a
push on Monday that can be able to
shorting too because the stock is on the
downside there's not much going on
except Friday and BEB and we had itv4
off drops as well with mbv
and now what I can tell is stock trade
assuming these six million shares
dropped about 20% of its high 30% of its
high so Monday 2morrow push well
certainly fail and we'll be looking too
short Monday morning but we'll see how
it goes but the key is I trade stocks by
statistics so if I don't have enough
confident and some factors I'm
conflicting with each other with
shorting at 10 and massive support 7.5
that's where that stay out of the way
because I want to see what's going to
happen so next time when I see the same
pattern happening and use this ticker as
my reference to be able to make better
decisions next time so I missed
MBV and I had that football a pretty
hard on Friday but I feel a lot better
because if I thought about it I can use
this as my reference in the next ten
times I can still use them to make my
profit so I'm pretty sure all traders
have fear of missing out and if you had
one of them you miss a good play just
think in a different way you can use as
a reference to make more money and this
is the best we can do we can't go back
in time I made money you're supposed to
be made and just think about what you
can do next well you can do better
that's how you can improve yourself as a
trader so this entire ticker going on
it's called a WSM and it's been going on
for a couple of days and it had this
fail spike every often I had a top of 21
so it actually failed in a 21-inch and
you know parabolic 2:22 filling the 20s
so I actually saying this needs to be
traded a bit more volume and it could
gap down on Monday to form overextended
captain pattern if you want to know more
about the pattern go ahead and check out
my trading technique courses and it
should help you to judge our typical
entry how to choose the correct exit and
that will be my thought process for
three potential tickers happened on
Friday and hopefully my lessons
help you you know trading career if you
want to check out my UCB conference I
will put a link below and it's
completely free if you want to know
about the stock market go ahead and
register we only can accept a certain
amount of people so if you on a spot

[Applause]
what's up guys doing duck cereal today
I'm gonna talk about my abl tray that I
made over 100,000 last couple days a
little bit sick but I promise you guys I
would do real lessons on this I will
also do it like a little bit monthly
report so this is one of my monthly
performance since November I think I
made over 350,000 now the major gains
coming from down Shore gap up Shore some
of the micro flow one of them is a Bao
and I did made mistakes a couple times
on the sticker I lost about thirty five
thousand in the front and I made ten
thousand backs I was down 20 thousand
ish then after him dump I made about a
hundred thousand and hold some of the
shares overnight and made about extra
sixty thousand what I'm showing you all
those are verified profits if you wanna
check out my trade to go to poverty will
show you exactly
entry/exit shares amount and so let me
go through all the top process for a PIL
by the way s and this was spiking the
stock was a pre market breaker now the
stuffing volume at the market open was a
lot so couldn't really break this for a
shorted it and risking the nod and
because I saw the resistance it's pretty
far from for daughter I think was at
eight I keep my size really small
buttoned up I took a loss into this
breakout and fought back again and
that's not okay so this is a fake out
people probably would be freaking out
and selling turns out break L again so I
completely cut the losses and wait until
the stock hits seven or eight area so
then stocks back again I took a short in
the 660 area and you fade back and a
half I thought okay I'm gonna sit and
starting winning for a properly it turns
out this huge balance coming in and I
see okay the bounce of this wrong I'm
not gonna going again because the stock
up probably have more potentials and
then
because you can see a bounce that coming
from a massive panic if the bounce is
over 75% or where it comes comes back up
you know really short amount of time
then the stock is highly likely going to
making your heart
so the stock come back again and in this
bounce they didn't get in because I want
to see how far it's bounced because I
won't be really really careful since I
already have the previous balance so it
turns out you broke out now and because
I don't want to go long into your
resistance zone so I just sit and
watched when the stock hits around $8
you come ready break
so I showed it again because risking the
day high so um turns out I was writing
down and and that was for sure the stock
is coming back down the stock runs back
again I got really frustrated but my
entry was 750 area so it was pretty
comfortable and when the stock keeps
getting into the last half an hour I was
getting nervous because I don't want to
hold that many shares overnight there
turns out he dumped I had a little bit
more shares in the six uh-huh I think
was 650 area then you fade back all the
way to 5 and the next morning it gapped
down 40% I basically took all my profits
off in a 340 area so that is my entire
trade for a PIL I don't think Albert
rated I cut my losses pretty decent and
I did made a couple of mistakes on there
don't sure something that is really too
far from existing especially on
microphone try to go wrong because if
you start to break out here I will
probably the wiser choice is to go long
and short because the stock the
resistance as I age and we're shooting
at 4 so that's not very ideal in the
stock market doing there's long it sure
don't get you biased on it because when
get you bias something like a s and s
will happen because if you're showing
anything that even has resistance you
still lose now what happens you are
showing something that without
resistance is an S if you look at the
historical chart it doesn't really
any resistance resistance is at 15 so if
you are shooting at to the resistance at
15 that's too far and you have a huge
and risk range and can really afford to
lose that in terms of that if the stock
is on the merged news were something
that have a solid contract winner or
merge news those are really really
bullish sign for stock to go up and when
we start to start to consolidate in game
or volume that's even more bullish for
the stock on the first screen day I did
tempted to go wrong yes and this but I
didn't and when the sleeper woke up I
was at 4 so pretty birdie on there but
so I was traded 40 million shares on the
day you probably will show my church
tomorrow seems like there will be a
multi day runner coming soon and it were
in November 1 December this is probably
the hottest seasons that we're
experiencing but under the ear so ABI L
the stock dealer offered before I think
into the next day so it stopped likely
to do offerings after a spike so please
don't go wrong if that's why you always
lose coming along on those tickers
overnight but if you can catch the right
moment if the resistance too far and can
really pair Bob it like this you can go
along on today for micro flow but don't
hold it overnight because you can get
something like this that massive
offering that you are certainly down 50%
that's something for beginners to be
really careful with first the rule you
don't want to do is cut your losses
cookie make sure your risk range with is
within 5% to 10% of your entire
positions and the next thing is you want
to do is don't host up overnight because
those unexpected panic that you can you
mean cut your losses that that would
straight break all your risk management
and then the next thing is you don't
know what to do because you have you're
forced to sell and so you forced to sell
you want to make that money bad once you
want to make that money back you will
cause a chain reaction of making bad
trades making
emotional traits that's how you really
really get frustrating the market so
keep your irrational mind on the
stickers especially on micro flow be
patient and APL it's probably my second
one of the biggest scan that I'm over
been over 100,000 turns out I lost $30
in the front trillion multiple times and
plus the borrow fees and to share the
mama shares I trade I traded and
overnight for you so um turns I probably
made about 55,000 60,000 dollars and yet
that one trade that I verify was a
hundred thousand so I made all of my
houses back with some extra so I hope
this video lessons helps and never come
about how you really should trade a bi
or microphone like this all right here
you guys is opinion that would be it and
hope you guys have a great holiday

SOURCE VIDEO: How My Student made $19,000 Profit in the First Month. [mXOco07vVf4].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys doing duck sir
welcome to my new video of the YouTube
and today I'm going to talk about some
major trades I did this month and I also
want to congrats one of my students in
my tier 3 program
he made around nineteen thousand dollars
in one month and this is his account
statement and there's a lot of students
profiting in my program and some of them
made a roughly two hundred thousand
dollars this month and they're not
comfortable showing account statements
and this is one of the student students
that are comfortable showing his account
statements this is how you can show
people to be consistently profitable and
you can see he minimize his losses and
he took a big loss Rafi here June 18
2013 2 and then he made his perfect
losses back and double it and it's okay
to make mistakes and if you can then
infernity move forward that's how you
make your profits back and he joined
since May 15th and I don't think every
did any trades were just going over
lectures on me May we did a bunch of
trades in June and this is how he did it
and we'll be posting more counseling
statements later if any students are
comfortable sharing and I've tried to
find one account students every single
month and to share with you and to go
over some trades so you guys can there
they can there as well and I will be
covering one of the biggest gain right
here 8,000 and 6,000 right here yeah all
those profits come from gvo and one of
the other ticker or to code she come
from
SP OTE so it's not about showing profits
in those console
the way I wanna show you guys is with a
small count like 20,000 it is possible
to make double good you know one month
but some people are asked me and can I
start counting with 500 no can I start
account with 1000 no you need to save
more money and most people are focused
on ok so if I save this amount of money
and I make and I can double my money in
one month or two months no because when
people are so eager to save the money
and once the money saved they go into
the market with zero knowledge and they
lose their money they lose our entire
game and they never want to do it again
so the way is to focus all the patterns
in the market and what patterns works
what parent doesn't and when you're
starting now you need to be focused down
ok this is why I don't need to focus on
this is what I need to be focused on to
grow my account because when you see all
those big words on Twitter there can are
a lot bigger than you so their
strategies are little bit different than
you and we are treating the same charge
of it done they can't win money because
they can add but you can't so develop a
strategy that specifically fits for you
and hopefully that I think that's what
it worked for me at the very beginning
of my trading career and let's go ahead
and talk about all those trades that I
made and all those to gain the big the
biggest game of the month that he made
and that is getting to it so there's one
of trade is GPO so I've been tracking
this massive multi day Runner and that
they all behave almost the same so
either they have a first green did in
the gap up
on this morning panicked they were--they
fail they almost come back all the time
and brick this morning hi so I tracked
those percentage and I think he picked
the shore at 24 39 which is which he
almost top ticked the ticker and since
his account is very small and once the
start losing I think he's I've started
swinging and he covered and all the way
and nine dollar so he meant almost the
entire game on the downside and you
don't need to catch the top but once you
figured out the moment is shifting and
can just swing all those chunks stocks
all the way to the end and as long as
the poorer fee is not expensive almost
all spikes get failed every single time
and later on if the stuff bounces it
will give fell again so and on GVL
considers multiple reverse splits and
down so much offering for the past year
and three mount so when the stuff does
the offering before you will expecting
they do again and again and again to
raise money for the company and this is
how he made one of the big profits on
gvl and also he made some profits on SPO
t so here's comes in handy of tracking
statistics because he knows what's the
average spiking percentage and what is
the fading percentage and what's the
percentage when they fade all the way
down what's the percentage you can exit
of the static in order to get the
maximum profit and I'll say when you
want to start it going to the penny
stock or if you're a beginner 3000-5000
I don't think is enough I started with
27,000 and this students he started with
20,000 so I was at least ten
and all those people ask me can I start
with a couple hundred dollars that's
that's not gonna work because you change
event handle the fees if you have around
the wrong broker because each FaceTime
broker charge you ten dollars back and
forth I just want to get all the BS out
there you can some people turn in you
can start with the cam with two thousand
three thousand I don't think it's very
possible and recently for all those
runners they all around in the
pre-market some of the pro kleh can even
trade in a pretty market when you go in
the drops and you lose money the only
thing I want to tell you is start when
you don't try to rush to make money
start save your money and in the
meantime study the patterns and figured
out what's your niche what's your
strategy was relative specifically fits
your account then you can go from there
so I think that will be it for today and
I hope my comment helps and I hope you
really can some somehow helps to help
you to grow your account and I will be
trying to find almost an account
statement that is one over one of them
just account statements today it's June
so we'll be posting July account
statement or or even my account
statements even I can post it or one of
my students so so basically just show
you what what's it looks like to be
consistent profitable and how to really
minimize your ass and what you need to
focus on when you have a different
account and what strategy you need to
focus on when you have a different count
size and I think their student here
really well and congrats to him and
hopefully their more profits to come
thank you very much and you guys have a
great day

also guys even doctors so I post these
counseling mints which is right here
here and other people have a lot of
questions about well what is this what
is that and what is equity all what is -
what's your Commission wants your barrel
fees and stuff like that so I
specifically doing this video to answer
all the questions in that statements and
basically in this video I will show you
my yearly account statements how I
turned twenty five thousand using to
back up count which is twenty five
thousand is as an issue pounds then back
up answer will be another twenty five
thousand will be twenty five thousand so
total plus together you'll be soon in
five thousand by the end of this video I
made about six hundred thirty thousand
gross five hundred fifty thousand net
profit and including the profits will be
overall five hundred thousand as the fan
of profit so as usual make sure to click
the like button and leave a comment
below if you have any quick questions
and you wanna see more consonants
there's a link below you can see how to
aggressively grow your account
statements I turn about forty thousand
three hundred thousand your mouth and
you can download statements there so
let's get into the video enjoy so right
here I'm gonna show you how to really
read statements a lot of people will
never read the statements before I don't
really know how to read statements so
right here I'm gonna show you how to
actually read the worst of Commission
fee words and net profit and how much
every trolls account hum where I started
so as you can see starting right here
April tuning 18th equity difference it
means that I started with twenty five
thousand two hundred eighty nine cent
$289 seventy cents so in this month the
gross profit I lost about 27 thousand
and realized profit and I lost about
twenty five thousand and the gross
profit and the realized profit the thing
really matters is the realist profit
that's number one number two you want to
catch the net profit this is where it
shows you on the skipper's on the screen
and this is where you actually lost
plastic on the mention fees and plus all
the ECM fees and stuff like that in May
at last bomb another twenty nine
thousand and realizes thirty thousand
net profits thirty six thousand so this
six thousand plus
in that included the first rail lines
30,000 plus extra six thousand
Commission so the net profit will be
negative thirty six thousand now in this
video as i mentioned i will start with a
twenty-five thousand dollar account with
to backup funds that means if i lose
this entire account i still have $25,000
I still have about 50,000 backup funds I
lost about fifty six thousand and I lost
another four thousand so that will be
around sixty thousand dollars so for all
the strategy I'm using it's purely
statistic based you'd be pay attention
to your trades not your profit and
realized because I have been tracking
for statistics for so long and very
confident of the performance on a long
term so a lot of people right here will
say well if I start with seventy five
dollars there are any last sixty five
thousand and I will be quick up again if
I don't have that much funds to start I
don't have a seventy-five thousand that
be account to start now in this video or
in this statement I want you to be
focused on not the money
I made to focus on the percentage growth
and overall round turn now I over lost
sixty thousand then in July and made
forty seven thousand realized profit pay
three K Commission's which is forty four
thousand during August since I had more
profitable trades coming in so August
was pretty good I made one hundred
seventy four thousand and a net profit
made 162,000 the August I took another
about 84,000 some of it are small losses
some of the SS big because has a really
high winning percentage maybe I did
something wrong and miscalculated risk
stuff like that so it's not very full on
a Mac it's not really full like computer
generated but try to be computer
generate as much as possible during
October
I'm with the power hundred twenty-five
thousand Commission will be right here
you have n thousand a profit will be one
hundred thirteen thousand now goes into
November since I have more funds
in the accounts I was making more money
in taking a little bit bigger positions
so November I had 148 thousand and the
net profit which 113,000 in December
which I made from 130,000 and pulling
into our original position have bigger
bigger size account I was making two
hundred three hundred thousand two
hundred seventy two thousand and that
probably two hundred fifty five thousand
this is how much shares I bought this
health insurance I sold this is where my
net profit is this one doesn't really
include the barrel fees the barrel fees
is about fifty thousand right here I
inject about twenty five thousand into
account this is where I lost the money
so and the injection are found and
starting as medically as twelve thousand
then I made thirty eight thousand right
here you can see one hundred seventy
four thousand and at net cash is 156
thousand this is how much money I was
drawled understand this is how much
money I withdraw from my account then I
left some money in the account about
another thirty thousand as you can see
it on November I withdraw 153,000
withdraw than 230,000 now right here I'm
gonna tell you why I always redraw my
profit since this account is fully
statistical generated so I want to be as
an automatic as possible that means I
want to be machine dies as possible the
reason why I start with twenty five
thousand with 225 thousand bank account
is because that in statistical analysis
there is a possibility that you can lose
ten times even though you have a many
personal memory on this pattern so if
you get really really unlucky then
that's where the tube backup sounds for
so that should clear up your question
now next thing is the more money I make
that means the more backup sounds I have
that means my system is likely that
means my system is unlikely to fail
that's why I created more backup funds
and withdraw them putting them as two
thousand hundred thousand hundred
thousand now in later case you can
increase your account size but you can
still need to have the same amount of
backup thumbs so later on was making
$125 148 thousand to almost three
hundred thousand then you can increase
the amount of count size and still have
couple of the backup thumbs and this is
how you use statistics to really
generate profit hopefully guys this is
understandable I'm gonna give you one
examples how to really use statistics
and how to really track and that will
block all the tickets right here because
there's a lot of work for other people
you guys have to do statistics analysis
on your own but right here I'm going to
show you the general idea now this is
the ticker attract and like which index
it is and what pattern is it and what's
the mark a pasta share outstanding then
later on you want to track what's the
range of us to risk award and you know
track was the winning percentage the
most thing that matters it will be the
pattern average winning percentage as
you can see the winning percentage right
here of the pattern statistics it will
be 87 percent that means if I keep using
this pattern and ten times I will pretty
much win nine out of ten times and that
odds of me losing on this specific
pattern ten times in a row is really
really low and actually in this
statement I did last two month that
means I did lost on his pattern for
straight five six to six times and
that's where my back button my backup
funds come into the play and overall
girls you can say I started with seven
five thousand you can say I started with
twenty five thousand you can say that
even started with Tim dolls and right
here is because I lost pretty much most
of my account so and Dulberg growth I
expanded into almost five hundred fifty
three thousand as net profit I probably
like us as I said 50,000 to 60,000 per
fee so to total net will be five hundred
thousand and either you can use 25,000
starting account making five hundred
thousand by
end of this year or you can start with
the 75 K account then still making five
hundred thousand of this year so Alice a
its overall five hundred percent growth
not by showing the statements I don't
really mean to really show off and stuff
like that it means that if you put
enough work and you track enough
statistics also you're tracking our iPad
and tracking the right thing and then
you will find a really good system for
you to completely eliminate emotional
out once you eliminate emotional
decisions out of the game then your
consonants supposed to look like this
your games are way bigger than your
asses so thank you very much and
hopefully you guys enjoy this video if
any more questions please leave a
comment below I know this thing is a
little bit confusing and can see this
all a statistical analysis across the
screen if you are beginner leave a
question below you can follow me on
Instagram and Twitter I can reply there
as well at the end of this video very
honest opinion you've had any more
questions about town statements or push
him about how to retry statistics and
general question about this video please
leave a comment below I want to answer
it so I think I made a clear as possible
thank you very much and that the end of

SOURCE VIDEO: How do Viruses Affect the Market？ [LH_HywCvz4g].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
all right ready to go we do we do the
virus bumpers capacitive inductor so
today I'm going to talk about Wuhan bars
and the flu that's been currently going
on in US and China Wuhan virus has not
infected about a thousand people or
around twenty to thirty now dead
with the flu about thirteen million
people already infected and 6600 people
has died from this massive flu been
going on generally one will have this
large event a lot of the stuff will
start going in different ways and will
cause something called hype and I would
have back in the years in 2016 2017 2018
each year would have its own hype in
different sectors 2016 2015 we had a
high pound shipping companies 2017-2018
we had Bitcoin and 2012 and 2013 I think
we had all the power tech happen as well
so going forward into this year we're
probably going to see the same thing now
a lot of the hype are based on what was
needed or what's the demand from the
market think about it so if we have flu
then we need vaccines if we have viruses
we need health care products so that
basically will increase the demand of
the stock that people wants to invest
into these type of certain sectors while
the stocks being hyped up now there's
two different result will come out from
this insane hype especially when were
looking at the ticker that increased
about a thousand percent 2,000 percent
first what we will see is the first
taker will start coming up as the
leading sector taker back in 16 we had
TRS back in 2017 and 2018 we had ptcs
those are the two leading tickers for
Bitcoin and shipping sectors so
basically in this hive we'll have one
ticker that brings all the volume for
this entire industry the majority of the
volume that was coming into this ticker
will spread into all different tickers
into the sector and the volume will be
all focused on swann ticker especially
when this company has really low flow
since we have a large amount of demand
will increase this ticker about a
thousand two thousand percent in couple
days so that we all know that company in
NASA
exchange when they have a really low cap
and really low flow often what we do
they will issue some type of offering or
warrant in the next week or two to raise
money for their project so lot of
investors going in Briony that think the
stock will go three thousand percent
even ten thousand percent in a couple
months but that's the wrong thinking of
trading all those type of low flow
stocks since its high but that we all
know all those bigger companies out
there like Tesla Amazon Apple those
companies takes years to grind into
today for a company to increase two
thousand two thousand percent couple of
days there has to be some type of over
reacting from buyers that buying massive
amount of shares at the beginning and
not thinking rationally to basically
investing into the stock and while the
stock is spiking a lot of people will
tell their friends their families were
spamming on internet basically pump the
stock for let other people buy with them
and we'll track more new bids to buy you
know invest in the stock market or just
to buy quick and sell quick when the
stock is surging into high price and you
will be on the news and we'll track more
buyers that's why when stock goons to
parabolic or consolidation where
breakout will try this amount of buyers
into the stock now will cause the stock
keep going up so for the next couple
minutes I will show you the examples of
all those types and how to really react
from them how to really take advantage
from the newbie buyers to be able to
short sale now as a reminder that
shorting at the front side into the hype
is very very dangerous as I said because
majority of the volume and demand are
coming in especially in the first two or
three days in reaction as a short setter
you have to wait be patient at least for
five to six days because every single
hat will create opportunities for the
long side and the short side because
it's a hype on the short side you will
generally trap a lot of buyers into the
spike and you can manipulate it when the
star is back again to take advantage of
the buyers from the people that already
lost money to this hype now on the front
side since the demand so high you can
really aim on a simple day place into
the same sector let's say we have the
sticker that already expect about two
thousand percent to 10 percent and when
you jump and you feel like you're late
you're chasing a stock now you can look
for a different sympathy play like the
same amount of sector that does the same
thing has the same low flow buy into
that since the stock till inspector far
when set against a low volume they can
make a lot of reward from sympathy play
so I will show a couple examples here
and that is getting to it so BTC s is
one of the leading company of this
sector now basically the stubborn from
one to twelve in a couple days so
basically what you need to find is the
stock values increasing day by day and
the volume has to be large in the
previous day so we call this as an early
day runner multi-donor generally that
with the Ohio based tracking a lot of
volume same thing goes into ptcs you
trade about 120 million volume as well
powders so that's a lot of equity
pouring into market in one day and we
aren't trying to take your advantage as
a short setter do you see the spike at
January 3rd the stock is competing the
resistance at 7 $60 so when's that spike
there see there's a large amount of
resistance these people already got
trapped into the stock first thing is to
start 1 to 12 and start down from 12 to
4 now in this case you know 90% people
are alone or are buyers and we Rapala
turned 12 and 8 and selling the stock
except for they will desperately holding
stock and hope the photos start to come
back same thing was that come back
they're looking to sell their positions
so that's how you really took advantage
of the hype especially when the volume
is so large it's a pretty much
impossible to break the resistance from
that couple weeks ago or a month ago the
Bitcoin hacked up several times and you
can see that each spike always failed
when it hits up to the resistance
hit about 10 fell to from the resistance
hit 6 again fail from resistance and in
this case stock spiked again since the
resistance is really far so you can't
really use them anymore
that's how to stop spike it all the way
to 18 and that's why you have to be
careful it's a short setter resistance
has to be very fresh it cannot be very
old it is from a couple years ago just
ignore them and that's pretty much for
the Bitcoin hype and ever since then to
start being flat for a very very
long time you can see the increase of
the stock price is very very low now
also one other thing is to be able to
take advantages in the front side first
you have to know what is going on
especially in two different sectors
let's say bitcoins being hyped up and
everybody's talking about Bitcoin the
first reaction had to go look for is
what are the leading confidence that is
trading the Bitcoin sectors
once you find those takers put them on
your scanner once you put them down the
scanner you want to try to find which
taker is attracting more volume compared
to other takers now only focus on the
ticker that is getting the most volume
once you find that taker start your
starting positions and find a distant
risk that's how you really ride the
train until the stock gains maximum
volume and there's no more von can be
pouring into the market that's where you
exit a stock that's for BTC s now let's
talk about the viruses and the flu the
first sector will be affected will be in
the vaccine market so when you are
seeing something like NBC and they're
developing nano vaccines for their
patient that's how they're spiking right
now as you can see an NBC s being out
for days now if you look at the one in
your chart pretty much nothing that's
been going on just to start doing
reverse split trading less volume now
when this hype came in it tracking a lot
of volume first secondly it's a very low
flow low cap and what you're looking for
is if the sigh has the potential to
spike a thousand two thousand percent
has to be into that flow and market cap
range so in this case typically within
stop tracking maximum volume always be
very careful with why we were shooting
into if you're shooting into something
that has a high demand in the market
right now and people are freaking out
because generally those viruses and flu
will affect people's emotion people are
scared being affected because they see a
opportunity people will make their
emotional decisions that's why everybody
started jumping into the one stock and
since there's a low flow for the first
no this is the first two or three days
that's why you can see the stockades
start to spike and we suspect about 82
percent overall I think will continue
into next week take it as you can see
it's already spiking after hours about
to break this resistance now for me
today overall I think
NBC and a HPI this is one of the
sympathy playoff NBC and it's called
healthcare products and some very
obvious that there is a lot of demand on
their sensors fares and fruit being
going on so this is the first screen day
as you can see now we are seeing nothing
has been happening for the past you know
year or two and you are seeing a large
surge of mana volume happening any time
of the day and is tracking more volume
compared to any days before now when
there's a hype coming in and you can see
a large spike into the ticker what you
can do is you should feel like that's a
core expect about 300% like NBC find
something like a HPI then you can really
take advantage of into the second day
gap and also you can use your knowledge
of the pre-market long estimate if
you're watching the duck senator you can
predict the volume of the entire day
compete with the previous state to find
out if today will actually get more the
quality or now once you find out that
question and then you have a really good
art to be able to you know predict the
stock would even go higher and to be
able to get in reward from that the
other sector I want to talk about is the
best hype that have never seen for a
while DRO is an GOP is you can see so
either take around talk about is dr is
and the GOP sdrs was already got a
listed it's pretty much a toxic
financing and they went to eight OTC and
announced bankruptcy dr is is the one
ticker that was feeding ticker that went
from $4 $220 this taker is extremely
dangerous they only had a past here
indicate flow now one suspect from 0 to
100 120 you bring every single shipping
companies around that had a low flow
load cap every single ticker was spiking
so when NBC gets out of control find out
all the relay tickers find out the low
flow low cap ones monitoring them
thieves are attracting volume that's
where you can gain of an inch on the
side of going along so that is pretty
much all the tickers that you can study
and make sure to check their statistics
once you can perfect that timing then
you can get mass amount of reward from
just be trading all those hives on when
you want year I see people making
millions of dollars just by treating the
hype
since thousands of percentages are going
into one day and there's gotta be
opportunity be created because a lot
people are new into the market so that's
pretty much for a haps today and MVC a
HP IP TCS and G OBS all those tickers
you can really put it into your
spreadsheets and to study them so I
would really highly recommend to track
every single stats on those tickers
backing when there's really start hyping
up so that's pretty much all the info
first video the flu is our virus are
everywhere now okay make sure take care
of ourselves
wrap you can rub it bro make sure to
take care of health and stay positive
and I'll see you guys in the next video

SOURCE VIDEO: How much capital do you need to trade PennyStocks？ [hIoTccFEfc4].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
that's all guys doing duck sir today
we're gonna talk about a little bit
different than the normal stuff we'll be
talking to you today we're gonna focus
on what's the ideal capital to start how
to trading stocks let's say if you're
completely beginners they have no idea
what to look for the first thing is I
would suggest going to google and type
was penny stocks or go into my youtube
channels and to say what things you can
pick up just get a general idea of what
penny stock is and the second thing is
when you want to go into your industry
and people are thinking about what I
will only invest $500 or $1000 that's
not gonna work the first thing is if
you're going to trade a stock black knee
and you have no idea what technical
analysis is or fundamental analysis is
you're just blind buying today it's more
it's worse than casino so the most of
the time you will lose almost all your
capitals and the first thing I did is I
looked into other people's other than
gurus or mentors and I know I'm gonna
run into some scammers and stuff but
it's good to have them to kind of find
out what's the real strategy is it's
good to have the general community and
can kind of dive in there to find what's
the real strategy now to how to refine
strategies as a topping the previous
video you can use statistics to really
see what's the highest winning
percentage of the pattern and to see how
they're performing throughout a half a
year or a year 2000 the industry - and
be consistent profitable I will say it
will take about six months to a year to
help you really get into the rhythm of
how to really trade I would recommend
starting with at least 20,000 because I
would say half of the money will go into
education how to learn technical
analysis fundamentals and we just watch
people live trade or subscribe other
services other people have you go boost
your knowledge much quicker from
learning the market because nary in the
market the first thing is you will get
emotional very quickly once you start
getting emotional you will lose control
once you lose control you lose your
account most of people blow up in that
way because they're refused to really
listen to others and I think tuning K is
a decent-size because I started with
27,000 pretty much half of the money way
into education
and half the money I started in my
trading account now if you're under PDT
you can split your funds into motive
brokers and you will have more trades
throughout the week right now I don't
really trade that much because I plays
around through the five trades per week
so just despite how many times our trade
is pretty much under the PDT rules if
you have a decent sized account I would
say the maximum you should place in your
accounts are around I would say 200,000
to 300,000 I wouldn't really suggest to
go over that it's better to have the
capital in there if you have let's say
over 200 300,000 but I wouldn't suggest
you use more than 200 to 300,000 in
capital in one trade penny stock learn
which is very small compared to futures
or options market the more resides in
the more you will affect the market
especially on those low floats and if
you were sizing too big you know short
positions and on a low flow you will
easily get blown out because once the
stock is going to the opposite
directions you're expecting and you're
starting Colossus the spread will make a
huge difference and also just by the
volatility of the low flow you will lose
much more money than you ever expected
other than that you know a regular flow
the average volume with typical trade is
between 10 million to 30 million so if
it's over 30-minute rates considered to
be crowded then I wouldn't say she's
been trading that now within that range
10 million to 30 million the correct
size into each tray is around
the maximum size you can say the
interest rate I will say around 50,000
to 70,000 sometimes 100,000 now for me
personally I wouldn't want to sizing if
the stock has not very good odds and I
do not want to sizing over 30,000
because on each trade if the stock is
trading certain volume there's
correlations between volume and how much
capital you can put into a trade so you
have to be really careful with the
volume capitals I would suggest building
like a spreadsheets to find out what's
the ratio and what's the volume because
if the bond is bigger you can size
anymore and not even if the maximum is
goes to 30 minute because if it gets
super crowded you cannot really predict
where she is most of the time so for me
personally 30,000 will be the best for a
decent trade now here is a high odds or
the perfect setup
I was sizing about 100 or
dozen one more no more than 300,000
because I think that's very very risky
into the opinion and that's pretty much
for today
one more thing I'm not mentioning about
you cannot really rush into this
industry even though we put in your game
you takes about two three years for you
to master it same thing with any other
industries either gaming or trading or
investing in real estate
it takes time so be patient you will see
without after you work hard for two
three years at that time you won't be
really regretting how much money you
invested in the industry so I would say
10,000 to 15,000 it's cheaper compared
to just investing your real estate that
is everything for today if you learn

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys steven here welcome to this
video today we're going to
talk about my 2021 games and also look
at the count statements
and also some of the things that you can
learn from your personal
trades and also you can figure out the
transitions between slow seasons and to
hot seasons so those are the patterns
you can go back
to your statements and try to figure out
okay is there
something that i should filter out is
there a trace that i should keep doing
what i'm doing
and also some of the method you can do
to manage your account as well
so a lot of points to talk about in this
video so before i start this video make
sure to click the like button and
subscribe let's get into the video
alright so uh first of all i think i
showed my 2020 account statement on
trade zero
so trade zero is one of my smarter
accounts this is where i do my internet
trades
that i go in and make sure to go out
before the day ends
there's a lot of trades in 2020 to 2021
which i use other brokerage to short
into
so i'm not going to cover in this video
but let's look at all the intraday
trades
through 2020 to 2021. also i want to go
over the habit between
slow season to hot seasons and these are
very important transitions for traders
to get used to
so uh let's look at 2021 first of all we
have
when the pandemic started the market was
slowly changing into the phase
to extreme volume that trades
pretty much 100 million shares per day
so in january it took me a couple months
to
actually get used to the market and get
used to the volume
you can see the profit is not
significant
compared to the later in the year i was
trying to figure out okay what's the
average pushing percentage for
gap up shore what is the maximum
drawdown percentage
for first rate day and what is the
maximum dollar block those terms which i
mentioned about
in a previous couple videos so if you
haven't checked that out
make sure uh look out for those terms
january 94 000
negative then we have another negative
100 000
in march so i had in total of three
negative months
uh in the entire year you can see that
uh
let's expand the chart
uh actually full
you heard that so for the entire year of
2020 you can see that i have four liquid
months
and for the rest the biggest month that
i had was 1.4 million in december alone
and you can see that after a huge month
i normally go into a small losses
because i tend to get overconfident
after a huge month and sizing way too
big mess up my patterns and
making many mistakes especially when you
had a huge win
in your trading career make sure
something's small in the slow season
because that's where you tend to make
the biggest mistakes in your career
they happened to me many times make sure
to take your profits out
whenever you make a huge game now let's
look at
2021 in this year alone already
i have made in total of 1.3 million
so between 2020 to 2021 in terms of
gross profit
2.8 million plus 1.3 around 5.1 million
in total
and let's look at the account statements
so in january and
february those two months normally are
really hot
because company tends to file their
losses they want to do
lots of offerings to gain money from
investors this is where the market
massively favors to the short side
you can see that i made 300 000 in
january close to 1 million in february
then march and april the market
general direction is kind of slowing
down so i haven't made
much trade for those two months it's
been really slow lately for the last
three weeks
so uh my profit it's staying around 1.2
1.3 million for the last two months
overall there is one thing you have to
pay attention to is
your borrow fees because the net profit
you can see right
on the right side uh net profit
you can see it's 1.29 million now this
number
does not include your dollar fees
so for 2020 alone out of my 2.7
uh gross well net profit there is about
two to three hundred thousand
winning to the borrower fees so in terms
of overall net profit between 2020 to
is anywhere between 4.8 4.7 million
dollars
so for that borrow fees is extremely
important
one of the rules for me especially when
you try to short a stock and try to
borrow your shares
try not to borrow stocks that is over 10
cents or above per share
because that's where it gets extremely
tricky now if you don't have enough edge
in this specific ticker that if you take
a loss
it will be a very difficult to recover
because you just add it to your loss to
become a bigger loss
so for 2020 and 2021 we're in this
extreme market conditions
so i don't really make 1 million a month
uh often in 2018 2019 that's where i
started to try to perfect my patterns
and practice my habits
and being disciplined as well so you can
see in 2018
my net profit starting from april in
2018 to december i made in total
of 600 000 for gross profit in terms of
net profit i have made
553 thousand probably around
50 000 in terms of total borrow fees and
you can see that i had
four red months and five green months
and i was be able to keep my losses
really small
so by looking at your account statements
the first thing you have to go over
will be how can you minimize your losses
on each month
that's the first step you have to take
to become a profitable trader
now once you progress your patterns and
perfect your strategies and being
disciplined
that's where you can turn red mounts
into green months
to become a profitable trader as long as
your biggest
win can overwhelm your biggest losses in
terms of
long term you can be very profitable in
your trading
career the third thing you want to do is
you want to keep your account or make
sure that
whenever something happens either you've
been too emotional in one day
you took a huge loss and you don't
really have a second chance to start
over again
so to be able to prevent you from being
emotional and taking the biggest losses
in your career
and this is where i split my account
into three different parts
so let's say i have in total of 75 000
account
i will keep 25 accounts in my trading
account i will keep 25k in my bank
account and 25k as a backup account
in this case i will be able to have
three chance if i
screw up on the first time so in this
way you will be able to prevent
from biggest losses that hit your
account and you don't really have a
second chance to trade again
up to this date i'm still using this
method even though i have
a billion dollar account i will still
keep one backup account and one account
that
if i see a big opportunities i will tend
to wired it in
to catch the opportunity to be able to
make more profit
so the last point if you look at your
account statements you can kind of see
that
some of the trades you kind of got lucky
to make a profit
some of the trades that you followed
your pattern you followed your rule you
made your profit
so you can try to filter all those dumb
losses out and also some of the over
trading
habits that you place the random trade
you're not sure if the strategy actually
can make money
once you filter all the unnecessary
trades out you will be able to
be much cleaner in terms of your
discipline
and to follow your rules especially on
your pattern
and those four general points that i
talked about
is very important and crucial to your
trading career
once you practice uh looking at your
account statements and be able to figure
it out
how to be disciplined and how to filter
your results
and also be willing to face your
mistakes
because everybody learn from mistakes
admit you're around and try to improve
your strategies that's how you can be
better
as a trader so it's a progress make sure
be patient
and be willing to learn track your
statistics and work hard i will see you
guys in the next video

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys my name is Steven ducks
today I have a little bit topic that a
lot of people want me to share with so
how much do they try to really make a
year and happiness industry for about
roughly three years now and I started
becoming consistent profitable in the
first six months so I'm probably one of
the faster openers and I spent opening
of time learning and here I'm gonna give
you exactly or a roughly estimate how
much do I really earn involved with
parole fees and execution fees and
overnight fees so I'm locating Ohio and
I started when I was 20 roughly 20 years
old in the summer has to remember and I
started with around 27,000 and at that
time I was using TN Ameritrade so with
the fees I don't really much know
because I have no idea I don't even know
what stock is I don't know what what I'm
buying it's by a random stock and make
money I'm not happy
so I ignore almost all the parts but
when I start officially start trading
the stock I'll have to include execution
fees borrow fees on IVs also and now let
me discuss some of the broker that I
have used so one of them is Centrepointe
another one is interactive broker and
the other one will be trade 0 I also use
copper traders as also for swing trading
I have been majorly with trades er
recently and I can discuss with you
about this month performance that I did
and now the first thing is talk about
the borrower fees typically you wanna I
typically borrow around worth of 1000 to
3000 per day depends on if there's a
stock or now sometimes I don't even
borrow at all because there's not a
ticker that meets my criteria so I just
basically wish the Pearl fees now I'm
average probably about I would say 600
to
thousand dollars per day so that times
about 22 trading days will be around
twenty thousand dollars so that's about
thirty thousand four thousand dollars on
the barrel fees and execution fees now
let's talk about overnight fees I barely
go overnight on the tickers but
sometimes I do each time on trade zero
they roughly charge about x seven on the
first night
I typically try to not hold them and
shares as possible but sometimes there's
a really good odds I have to hold it and
I pay about twenty percent of the
profits into the next day which is a lot
but if there's are really high winning
percentage it's free money right now so
on EPL which happened last week me
around sixty thousand roughly estimate
on the net profit on day trading there's
a lot of cost into it so make sure
include all those stuffs that include
all those factors and sober all fees
execution fees overnight fees so all
those plus together will be equal about
one hundred to one hundred thousand
dollar ish on the overall charging so
come out in the day about two hundred
fifty thousand dollars a month if you
are with trade zero you have to
definitely include all those factors in
charity broker interactive does really
cheap commissions but they don't really
have a good barrel I'll interact your
broker it's probably really hard find
shirts to show around those hard to
power stocks now etrade are really good
for hard to borrow if they're the flow
is around ten to Tony billion ish ten
million or above sure traders they're
good cobra traders cope are trading
they're good a lot of times I risk my
barrel fees because I didn't make my
criteria and end up wasting a lot of
money on those shares as a beginner
early 2016 and I started with really
small amount of money in the barrel fees
will be around $1,000 to $3,000
and on the benefit sighs I can earn
about 20,000 to 30,000 dollars per month
so the barrel fees and overnight fees
will equal about 30% of your profit
sometimes 20 to 25% with trade zero will
probably equal about 30 percent or
process of your profit so make sure to
choose the right broker before you go in
with your strategy because all those big
commissions and borrow fees will play a
big factor of your net profit it seems
really small at the beginning but end of
the day I realize all those things play
a big factor and the day you realize you
are paying a lot of money to those
brokers so for my personal opinion I
would say trigger could if you're a
really skilled trader you can make about
one to two million dollars you put in
stock I think the maximum cap you can
make it round five million dollars to
ten million dollars on Penny Stocks per
year I'm not at that level yet I'm
trying to be at that level and also in
trading you can experience your masters
as well so if you're winning that's fine
you're paying thirty percent twenty
percent overall commissions to the
broker
like you're losing then you're have to
count that as well because commissions
and fees are overnight fees will add
extra on your lose amount before you
jump in in day trading full-time you
have to fully consider all those factors
with your strategies with your brokers
with your Commission's with your net
profit what's your average gain and you
also have the statistics that how many
times does the strategy happens per year
so you can generally calculate what's
the average gain of the entire year if
the strategy follow those statistics so
that's a really important thing that
before jump into your full time on day
trading now as a beginner I will suggest
doing this as part time trying to figure
out what strategy when I focus on two
new figures out what broker fits you the
best
if you're going long just choosing
target broker I forego in short to
center point or trader or
Cobar trading whatever fits the best for
you there's a lot of stuff going into it
so because people in this sector people
are looking to get rich quick they're
looking to really have to eagerly jump
into it but it's not like that
everything has to take into a
consideration because that's how I made
the mistakes earlier because I didn't
count all those commissions how much
percentage that took off of my net
profit and that year plus commissions
plus to the broker and tax I basically
get around left like 30% to 40% of my
profit but he's still a lot and in day
trading that opportunity comes to you
you don't come to the opportunity so you
don't have a really passive income so
aggressive income because you are
catching the opportunities so as a
beginner I suggest to have an hour job
and take about a year to try to figure
out why you were trying to do to figure
out the strategies I think back in the
2016 I was young I have nothing to lose
and I just basically went oh and I don't
think that was a really good idea
because a lot of people actually failed
into this industry so if you're looking
to get into the sector start slowly
figure out strategies brokers and all
the cost that goes into this full time
studying and how do you execute in your
strategies at last I hope this video is
helpful all my strategies are based on
shorting and go 80% short 20% long and
those are my personal statistics for
myself that fits my own strategies if
you're looking to learn more about my
strategy click the link below but it
will take you and explain you the detail
my strategies and I hope this video
helps and you guys have a great holiday

channel to grow and let's get into the
video
in 2020 since the market is slowing down
now i want to talk about performances
this month and last month so let's talk
about august
i made close to 221 thousand
i did took a decent loss on this day i
forgot what ticket i traded but
i traded about three times i think took
30k on each trade and that was the
biggest loss in this month
and overall i think i did pretty well
for the last two weeks there's nothing
really happened
so didn't really trade that much pretty
much all the performances come from the
first two weeks
so in july overall i made close up to
452 thousand
it's much more compared to august so i
did about 221 000 in august
452 000 in july and i did post couple
account statements
for the last couple months for may june
july and august in this four months and
made up to
close to 3 million in profit
and if you don't go check out the
account statements it's in the previous
couple of videos
i did multiple monthly recap and also
combined with
all the hot tickers in that month so
make sure to check it out
so when you want to look at in terms of
how much growth you can gain
a year you want to look at the frequency
of the pattern and how much risk reward
has increased
since last year when i track a certain
pattern i want to try
okay this is how many times that can
happen per year
and this is how much reward it can gain
per pattern back in 2018 and 2019
uh pretty much the past five years gap
up short and bounce short happens around
70 to 80 times per year
now when we are in 2020 bouncer happens
over 130 times already were not even
close to the end of the year yet so that
type of opportunity increased and
also increased the amount of volume in
the current market which i'm
going to talk about later in this video
once we track how many times the pattern
can happen per year
then we want to look at the risk award
typical risk award um
shorting patterns or going long shorting
is around 20 to 25 percent
now that's without offering the warrants
getting executed in the market
and going along you can win up to 60 to
100 percent
now i have made many many trade in 2020
that i
made over 100 sometimes even 300 percent
so that type of reward increased as well
but looking at this year
in 2020 we have a large amount of
opportunities appeared
compared to 2019 and 2018 and also the
reward
increased about 50 to 60 percent in
average
so if you are a beginner you only want
to stick to one pattern
i suggest to track the frequency of the
pattern can happen per month
especially because you want to start
with a small increment at first
then you want to go into a long-term
goal let's say a year
two year or three years but at the
beginning how many times happen per
month
then you will have that patience to wait
for that type of opportunity to come
instead of going after your trade to
potentially lose money
so after doing the research of how many
times can happen per
year and how much reward you can get per
pattern you want to go
into details of the pattern because
sometimes when the market change
the amount of opportunity growing in the
market will also attract
more volume into the market and volume
is the major indicator that can increase
the pattern winning percentage
so for example let's look at bounce
short right the more
volume can trade in individual
resistance will cause more back orders
the more people come to the market and
trade in that one day
somebody is going to lose money because
90 of the people doesn't really know how
to trade or doesn't really know
the market and they end up losing money
because they don't have the knowledge
that also means it will increase your
winning percentage on your shorting
pattern
in this type of market when you are
shorting to a second green day
or a multi-day runner you don't really
know where the limit is before
you gather all the data so back in
march and april i did took some bigger
losses around the 90k adk
because i don't really know okay well
this is the name of the market and this
is how much volume
can potentially increase by the end of
the day so let me give you a decent
example for you to understand this type
of concept
first of all when you look at the entire
intraday typical volume can trade
anywhere between 25 million to 40
million in one inch a day
by having all those data collected you
will know okay the average
potential volume can land around 100
million to 200 million
and at what time the stock will trap
enough back orders for the start to go
down so
with amount of volume increase typical
volume can trade in the morning it's
around 20 to 30 million in 2019
when we're going into 2020 the typical
volume can trade in the morning can land
anywhere between
60 million to 80 million and you want to
look for that volume
first before you enter a stock because
with the market change the amount of
volume
will tell you okay this is the maximum
backups can get
in today before you can show the stock
to increase your winning percentage
so studying the volume is very important
this is how to really value
how much backgrounders can trap in the
morning by reading the average volume
the second method you can use on the
volume is you want to
track the maximum volume you can get in
one day
so in average we are getting around 100
million to 200 million in a day but the
maximum is around 500 million to 400
million
when the stock gets really really
overcrowded
i know the volume is unlikely to exceed
400 to 500 million
so when the volume actually reached to
that limit i know the stock is likely to
drop
so the maximum volume tracking on your
statistic sheets
is really helpful especially when you're
looking to shore
some of the bigger runners so in
conclusions you have to focus on the
frequency of the pattern the reward of
the pattern
and also be able to adapt into current
market condition
which i mean by volume by reading the
correct volume you should help you
prevent making much more mistakes and
also getting much
accurate entry as well so that'll be end
of this video
hopefully you learned something and can
be applied into your own method
and that will be the end of this video
thank you very much for watching and i
will see you guys in the next one

hello guys steven doctor
welcome to this video so in this video
i'm going to show you my 2020
performance
in terms of my trading profits so i do
understand there's a lot of people that
have a doubt about me that they're
saying
my account statements aren't real so
here will be a live video
of me logging into my tracer account
so and explain you how to really read
the account statements as well so let's
get into it
all right and now we are
in so this is my name uh
and this is my current account value so
this is how much money it's in my 30
account
the reason why i keep around 230 000
is it's for protection reasons
because the majority of the brokerage
that's in us
that if there's anything happen to the
brokerage
and they will insure you about 250 000
in terms of if everything just went down
that's why i always keep anywhere under
250 000
and if there is much more opportunities
you can actually wire money in
and withdraw it out once you are done
with the trade
so let's go into uh the account you
click the account
click the account summary and let's do
year 2020 and you can see
let's expand the page
so uh for year 2020 we have
january last hundred thousand
february may 28 000 then march
last a hundred thousand then
april mid 40 uh may made 200 000 then
it goes on so by the end of the year
i have totally made in terms of net
profit after commissions
but this one doesn't include the
borrower fees so in terms of net profit
not including
the borrower fees is around two million
one hundred
seventy eight thousand now let's look at
in terms of borrow fees
i will include uh how much borrow fee
will take
uh in terms of your trading for the
whole year so if you guys have any
questions
uh leave a comment below let's get into
the video
as i just shown in video i have made in
total of 2.2 million dollars just in
trade zero
uh comment below if you guys want to see
my other brokerage account statements
because different brokerage has its own
account statement
structure so for this video especially
for beginners
a lot of people are curious about how
much money they can make
as a day trader if they started right
now
so uh let me just share my journey a
little bit if you guys don't know me
that well
i started this trading career back when
i was 19 now i'm 26
that's where i started to learn about
trading like what is trading what is etf
options and forex everything that's
trading related
and at that time i had only about
five hundred dollars in my pocket so i
was trading etf at the very beginning
making hundred dollar twenty dollars a
day and i feel
very good about it then once i started
going really deep into this trading
industry
i risked my tuition as well
so in total have about 26 000
at the very beginning to start trading
and after about a year
studying about 10 hours a day and pretty
much every day when i got three times to
study
after about i'll say 9 to 12 months i
have grewed
my account from 26 000 to almost a
million dollars
so close to 900 000 so here i'm going to
explain some of the basic structures of
the go through
and some of the points that i realized
later in my trading
career maybe i should do this i could
grow my
account much faster than what i'm using
a long time before so you took a lot of
adapting
tuning my strategies back and forth but
overall the structure will never change
so first step for beginners you will
have to find
some type of pattern you are looking for
so first of all that you want to see a
repetitive
action especially after market open are
normally on a focus between 9 to 11 am
after that once you find the repetitive
behavior of a chart
and you want to see that is it possible
to apply the same action into other
tickers
in this way once you do it for a while
you will find
some type of repetitive pattern for you
to start with
and that's how i started with all the
first day
gappers and the second thing you want to
track will be winning percentage
two especially when you have a small
account you want to grow your account
very aggressively so you have a decent
account size for you to trade in later
so what i did was that the higher the
winning percentage
of that pattern i will put more equity
in there so basically i was using
a higher equity for higher winning
percentage pattern lower equity for
lower winning percentage pattern
i understand some people started with
three thousand to five thousand
and it's going to be a very difficult
journey because
we have about thirty thousand to fifty
thousand it's
much easier to grow your account
compared to have a account
anywhere between three thousand to five
thousand because you're stuck
under pdt rules there's a limit of how
many trades of the
place waiting a week especially for a
really hot market conditions
it's very difficult to select the
perfect trade because there's so many
opportunities going on in that month so
at the beginning
if you started with under 25 000 you had
to be very very patient
about the trade you are selecting and
make sure it's perfect
and you have a decent risk award also
never get greedy the reason why ninety
percent of the traders fail
is they don't have enough patience
because as a beginner
that they don't have the discipline as
experienced
trader to only select three to four
best trades out of the week and to be
able to profit from that
the second question that a lot of people
are very curious about is the
commissions
so let's talk about my commission
journeys
by using trade zero so normally for
commissions
itself doesn't include the borrower fees
it's about five percent of your total
net profit
now the real expenses comes after
the massive borrower fees if you guys
are focusing on the shorting strategy
which i think is very valuable for a
small account
there is a specific limit you want to
actually be very careful with
because when the borrow fee exceeds
this is a fixed number i just remember
that if you are
trying to get into the industry it's
going to be very helpful for you
if the borrowed exceed 10 cents at per
share
it's going to be very difficult to grow
your account
uh if you took a loss on this trade not
only you took the loss from this trade
you're taking losses from the borrower
fee as well
so you better make sure that it's going
to be a very profitable trade
or just don't borrow the shares normally
that i
don't borrow the shares because it's too
expensive
and i'm not 100 sure i'm going to make
money
from this trade if you are getting into
the shorting industry
make sure that the borrow fee doesn't
exceed 10 cents
now once you add it up of the borrower
fees throughout the year
it's going to take anywhere up to
fifteen percent
to twenty percent of your net profit so
let's say you made uh two million dollar
this
a year you have to pay anywhere between
two hundred thousand to three hundred
thousand
for borrow fees and commissions probably
350 250 to 350-ish so that's a decent
amount
so on the other hand if you're not sure
you're a consistent profitable trader
don't get into this industry
you have to start tracking build your
statistics sheets
and make sure that you have a clear edge
for you to make money from
because soon as you're getting into this
game not only you have to pay tuitions
into the market you have to also
pay the commissions as well basically if
you are a losing trader you have to pay
extra 15 to 20 percent fees just for
the borrowers the last point i want to
make
is a struggle that i've been still
struggling
up to this day is you have to willing to
face your mistake
because sometimes as a trader and you
make
mistakes you are not willing to face it
i have this problem that
when i take a massive loss or a decent
loss i don't want to go back to my
counseling
and look at the entry and exit because i
feel
somewhat embarrassed
and after about one or two years i was
very willing to face my mistakes
and to see okay what if i just don't do
this
for shorting let's say first green day
consistently on low floats and let's
just not touch that
get rid of all the gains and losses
trading on the first screen day
to see what your actual performance will
be so if you are willing to face your
mistakes and
to make changes on that you will
definitely be much better trader
and also your learning curve will be
much faster than other people
because naturally people comes into
mistakes and they're now willing to
accept it and they're not willing to
admit
they're wrong and it's going to be very
difficult for them to become
a better trader so that would be all of
the points i want to cover for
this video hopefully it's helpful and

have any questions please leave a
comment below i will get back to you
thank you for watching i will see you

hello guys steven dux here welcome to
this video so today i want to talk about
the plans i'm going to trade uh in the
rest of the year as i talked about in
the last video this market has
significantly
lost its you know volume compared to
2021 2020
since 2020 we had this massive stimulus
check that's pouring into the market
pumped up the equity markets and there's
tons of
companies that's going up thousands and
thousands of percent
without any fundamentals so those became
a really good shooting opportunities but
for now uh the stimulus has been taken
out of the market the federal reserve is
pulling out one of the most hawkish
plans that they're going to taking out
the liquidity of the markets definitely
the play has
especially in the printing stock or
small cap area
the play has been significantly reduced
when you haven't seen bounce shore gap
up shore
dollar block those statistics will
completely get changed once people start
to adapt into this market
and right now we still have place here
and there
it's not like we don't have place at all
so in the rest of the year we need to
work on
very specific risk management and also
be able to i would say come up a
strategy to trade a market
and i understand there's tons of factors
that's affecting the global economy and
also affecting you know how
the spi and the queues
perform but overall you know downtrend
of the rest of the year um during qt the
market tends to
go down
in a general trend
so
trading the overall market is completely
different compared to the small cap i
normally make your decisions in one go
so you take your injury and you
exit
by the end of the day or by the
end of the next day but for the overall
markets you kind of have to hold
overnight and make sure that you
give the stock specific range to
give yourself multiple entries
during different days that's how you can
average
that's how you can manage your entry get
a good average and also be able to get a
good risk management so in terms of
return treating the overall market the
return definitely will not be as good as
trading penny stocks because
small caps normally generate 50 or even
70 return in one day uh for the over
markets you are probably looking at
two percent five percent if you're
trading the uh t triple q's that's three
times leverage you can gain probably
um just three times more and will be no
more than 15 in one day so for those um
two different markets they are
completely different but in the future
videos i will be able to dive in in
those etfs and
bigger caps so my general thoughts is
right now as a small cap traders there's
still tons of plays out there
just probably
gets cut two-thirds of the place so if
there is a hundred play in 2021 we
probably have around maybe 20 to 30
plays in a year but still you can still
be able to make tons of money by trading
in the small caps
so there's here comes another strategy
for the bigger caps uh as you know that
we had tons of
uh speculations uh for bitcoin
uh then we had tons of meme stocks like
dogecoin
gme amc and one of the bigger beam
stocks but actually had fundamental is
tesla pretty much all of those overhyped
tickers will get a significant drawdown
uh and probably crash into zero if they
have no fundamentals other than
potentially tesla normally in a bear
market
resistance matters more than the support
so you can build your portfolio i would
say 50 into shorting those meme stocks
and that still has tons of
room to drop like and me and say those
will drop to zero
probably closer to zero uh tesla will
have a significant drawdown probably
more than fifty percent
um
until the fed says something else we're
going back into printing mounting again
which i don't think they will do
and for all those meme stocks be very
careful especially
for the millennials tends to go
you know by the dip
that's one of the main thing for them in
2020 but right now the liquidity has
been
pulling out of the markets so be very
careful buying the dip
and in
short term technical analysis you can
buy the dip because shorts tends to
cover and ride the market for a few
weeks but that's not going to work in a
long run so be careful with
uh buying the dip and a lot of people
tends to promote that on youtube so one
of the main thing i want to focus or you
should focus as a beginner where you're
trading this market environment is be
very focused on your risk management do
not risk the money that you can lose
because in this market it's very brutal
you can notice that this market is
coming after the millennials and coming
after all those investors that don't
have
discipline they don't have risk
management and all those people will get
wrapped up before um you know the market
comes back so that's my overall thoughts
for this video
and
let's dive in some few charts
of what happened this week and while we
can potentially trade
into the next week
all right so let's take a look at vru
this sticker has been spiking for two
days and gained about 100 percent now i
haven't seen a ticker that's
going up 100
in one day for quite a while
so this is the one that went up hundred
percent in two days uh this
it had resistance up in in the april
18 and
april 8 which this resistance gets
cancelled by the volume that's trading
above it the price is trading above it
so the main resistance is around 15 and
between 15 and 16 years trading about
100 million volume
quite aware
in
the 2021 markets going into the second
green day on the stock consolidated
throughout the entire day so what you
are looking for is
going into monday probably respect the
15 test at 15 resistance again
uh then consolidate around 12 and before
the final breakdown so
as long as the ticker doesn't break
through 15 i think this will be a decent
shorting opportunity
in upcoming days but just be careful
because this one doesn't produce enough
range for you to shorten to 100 maybe
drop to 10 max
try and drop to 9 it's quite a stretch
so
uh that's my thought on vru now let's
take a look at
one of the other
would say
medium stocks
gme amc this is getting completely
destroyed from
last year
starting in may
dropped quite a bit since last push i
think i alerted i shorted the amc in
around 31 and covered it into the 20s um
didn't thought i can fade that far
but you can clearly see
that pretty much all the meme stocks
that got hyped in 2021 is getting
completely destroyed
same thing goes on to gme so gme is
holding better than amc but uh when
either bitcoin goes to
ten thousand seven thousand on all those
tickers will probably get killed um
going back to the single digits and for
future plan i will say
this market is definitely favor the
short sellers into any pop you can short
into any pops as long you can have have
a solid risk shooting into any pops into
parabolic spikes on those meme stocks
that has no fundamentals those will be a
great opportunities for you to make
money in this market
in terms of buying i would
try to avoid that because
timing the dip in the overall market is
extremely difficult try a small dip buy
here and there and you know track some
data but
i wouldn't recommend not buying this
market so
uh that would be my plan for the rest of
the year let me know your thoughts also
we have a conference upcoming in july
and we will put a link below for you to
register uh if you want to come in and
listen uh other traders to talk and how
traded in 2021 and what's
my i was a more detailed plan in the
upcoming future i think it will be a
really good opportunities for you guys
to really learn from each other and also
be able to have a solid plan going to
the
future markets because we're shifting
into a different age for this market so
that'll be uh end of this video thank
you very much for watching i will see
you guys

account statements uh for the last two
months it's one of my smaller accounts
and I've been using it to test my
patterns and to uh get a grasp of what's
the current market Trend and we have
about 15 takers to go over so today I'm
going to go over the biggest losses and
the biggest scanned and to go over the
chart and what's going to be my thought
process other than that we have a
conference that's coming up between the
18th to the 20th and we only have a
couple days to sign up so currently we
have a discount to sign up in the last
couple days so make sure you check out
the link below and let's get into the
video we have about 15 takers in total
big skin is bxrx and biggest losses was
bzfd those are the two tickers that's
where they stand out the bbby I will do
uh separate videos going over the
sticker and uh it was a little bit
tricky and overall I think bbby was the
biggest scan compared to the bxrx on a
different account and but today we're
going to go over bxrx and bcfd so uh
let's get into those stickers
so uh bzfd I think this one I took 60k
losses 67
um I think the major uh losses I took
one was on the on the day before the
final panic
um
I think I shorted it into the 3.6 I
think the size was a little bit too big
and they covered around 3.8 so that's uh
uh what else is there I shouldn't have
shorting to the consolidations I should
have waited until the next day uh I got
a little bit too eager rushing into a
short into consolidations so on the next
day uh with the one comparison it's
definitely favors the shore uh the
pre-market volume is only about 1
million or 2 million overall I traded
only uh 20 million before
um before we go into the afternoon bong
itself is not going to exceed the
consolidation volume that's why I took a
short around 3.5 added another into the
strength around 2.6 I was in Asia so the
time zone is a little bit different I
don't have the confidence you know to
hold throughout the entire day while
going to sleep that's why I didn't make
all the losses back but if I was in a
different correct time zone I should be
positive on bcfd uh it is a three dollar
stock going from uh about one dollar to
four and the market cap is initial
market cap is under 100 million so it is
actually tradable uh let's take a look
at the dollar block on consolidations so
from here to here about traded about 100
million shares around four and 20 to 30
million shares around 3.5 so overall
together it traded about 500 million
dollar in terms of dollar block this is
actually worth it to track uh for
multi-downers data block especially for
uh you know the most recent market
conditions and in the future it's much
easier to spot these type of multi
Runners and it's much easier to
shortening to it so one of the uh thing
that you guys want to pay attention to
is because we're trading those low
dollar ticker that as I mentioned in
2021 I do non-trade stickers that's
under three dollars and what I'm
observing recently is two dollars is
actually the big neutralized Zone if the
stock is trading sufficiently enough
volume and the stock is very difficult
to fade under two the reason is if the
stock is trading sufficiently enough
volume and that also means the retail
Traders can buy more shares because
Shares are cheap and there is a minimum
price maintenance that the retail
Traders can you know maintain the stock
above too
but if the price is more expensive that
means they can buy less shares and
they're not going to control more
percentage of the flow that also means
the stock is likely to drop more so
whenever you are shorting these type of
multi-day Runners make sure to cover on
you know when it approaches the minimum
two dollars and that's what I've been
doing and you can see there's a little
bit there's a support around 2.4 so
personally I would cover a little bit
about the support which is 2.4 2.5 ish
maybe a little bit of around 2.7
all right let's talk about bxrx on total
gain is about 90k
and you can see this is short entry
resistance play we have two resistance
already one around
five one around
6.6 and resistance can be added together
if most recent resistance price does not
exceed the historical resistance price
and the timeline is within six months
then you can add the resistance together
and so overall will be about 15 million
resistance altogether
on this stage with about 48 million so
it did not exceed the resistance volume
when the stock gapped through of the
resistance typically all those support
they do not hold and I think I got about
the float is around 1.5 to trade is
wrong
um I think I got about 30k shares
shooting around 6.7 I'll cover around
four and that will be the end of the
trade so that'll be the two bigger
trades throughout the month uh PP by I
will do a separate videos about this one
I don't think it was tradable after the
offering and msgm so those are the crazy
runners in the last two months I will be
uh doing a recap in those two tickers in
the next video all right guys that'll be
end of this video uh make sure to sign
up for the conference uh check out the
linking below and other than that I will
see you guys in the next one

do not be carried by losses too far stay
away from low price stickers that's very
crowded also once the consolidation
breakout happens do not make multiple
attempts in the afternoon also uh make
sure you have a good conviction to be
able to tell what pattern it is to trade
in the future for cpop not just the
regular game for multiple atts for round
short all right guys that'll be the two
trades biggest losses and biggest wins
for the year and there's a lot of
tickers that happened this year but of

what's up guys doing knock sir so before
I start this video we have a virtual
conference coming in the 28th 29th and
30th but when you're trying to crap you
didn't track then you got nervous and
shorting the breakdown to Thursday
trying to take their bid so they're
trying to sort of track them so today
I'm going to talk about some of the
tactics you can use when you are trading
intraday without a resistance and
support so a lot of tickers have been
happening recently I'm going to give a
couple examples like GMR a sale DX and a
HPI and all those intraday tickers
involve some type of method to use
especially when you're trying to spot a
short squeeze and how to really buy
together a vintage or a decent reward
I'm trying to go long there's going to
be three tips I'm going to give you
today so the first table of me to give
you today will be how to really
manipulate SS are trade short selling
restrictions plays a very important rule
especially when you're trying to spot a
short squeeze the normally happens
without resistance and it also happens
with a gap up Shore that was SSR and
with low flow at the same time of course
is going to get all of all you not a
demand that's where it causes a massive
short squeeze and people are expecting
to go lower but when they trying to crap
it didn't crash the shorts are trying to
chasing the breakdown but you cannot hit
the bid and especially in our SSR that's
why it causes a short squeeze I'm going
to get a little bit more detail in that
but let's get into the graph first
alright so this is a very good example
on BMR a and we all first looked at not
a decent gap of course we look at the
market cap and flow first it was a
decent flow and market cap he's
considered to be a low flow and recently
I'll be giving a lot of volume
especially on the biotech stocks related
to coronavirus and you can see this type
of trend the stock is on SSR short
serves restrictions short sale
restrictions means that if you're not
sure the stock people has to buy your
shares on the ask side so that you can't
really hit the bid just say there's
about a thousand shares on the bit side
and you're trying to short a thousand
shares right now you cannot take the bid
or execute it instantly trying to take
out that thousand
you have to wait until some people buy
you're asked to fill your order now
that's where it gets a little bit weird
it's because you're trying to place a
limit order well in short start trying
to get a position in general they
usually use market orders especially in
very fast recruiting scenarios when the
stock tends to break down into this five
dollar area and you can see a sense the
breakdown happens there's tons of them
coming in and short sales cannot you
know force the breakdown to break down
even harder to trigger a bunch of stop
losses that's where you reversed and try
to break this 8 hour area then you went
to $20 later on and the reason why you
can't really short into this type of
consolidations it's because sellers are
majority stuck in this five six seven
dollar area and they're expecting it
start to come down because it was a
short squeeze that's where it happens
most of the time especially in get
offshore and tends to camp out in the
second day and pretty much blow out
people that didn't cut their losses so
first of all you wanna look at will be
consistent and break down the stock it's
not really breaking down and also the
stock that's our instant reverse based
on the charts now typically when the
chart looks very bearish and we're
starting to explode ish and the stocks
and I say sorry that's where your
triggers bunch of short squeezes and you
can really take advantage of that by
buying into these type of breakouts so
BM RA will be the perfect example buying
around $1 ish and by statistics
typically the stock spikes extra 30% to
60% so you can how you take advantage on
that one and that's for BMR Aid and
today I'll have another one it's called
a STC so this ticker we kind of see
what's going to happen long before it
happens
so STC he tried to broke down into this
3.37 area and before the market opens
early trading like two or three million
volume so we are seeing the stock is
trading choosers 3 million volume and
it's trading a lot of volume in the
first hour now think about the liquidity
is going to effect on a stock price
because the stocks are in relatively low
flow and we have about
let's say ten million shares of 20
miniatures traded right around $4 area
so when you see a bunch of demand a you
are seeing a low flow bunch of volume
will indicate the demand and the flow
will indicate a supply so we are seeing
overwhelming demand in to Talam our
supply the stuff of course is going to
spike and that's where when people are
looking at stock market in general they
are saying okay the sake now again 200
percent 1 percent in the free market and
keeps spiking now of course that's
really where but if there's enough
demand you can overwhelm that especially
with our resistance so when you look at
a STC waiting a year in November 14
there's only about 40 million resistance
over 30 million citizens and majority of
them almost got canceled because into
this spike and despite people are
holding around 2 or 3 dollars right here
our journey slowly getting now and
eventually dropped so the resistance
around $3 H is not that big of a deal
and that's where caused a short squeeze
today so never try to judge never try to
judge the extension based on how much
stuff has spiked especially on intraday
the stock can spike about two thousand
three thousand percent on a day and they
can keep spiking the there is no way for
them to stop because the more it spikes
the more short squeezes is going to
happen people will get more emotional
that's where avoiding the first Green
Day is a very important rule for short
sellers and you want to judge the
extension based on how many days trying
to spike its day today will be the
seventh day or the eighth day of stock
being running consistently for the past
a week and that's where you can tell the
stock is going to perform the first red
day and that's where you can take
advantage of that pattern so the problem
is you can't really judge based on how
much the stock has spiked on intraday
you can't want to judge by multi day
basis and that's where most short
sellers make their mistakes on so on the
first green day if you are seeing a gap
up short and SS arch or so restrictions
don't chase it into the break downs
always wait on to a stock take softer
SSR then
goes for mutti Tehran you can show there
later because that's where the stock is
performing the weaknesses most likely so
that's the video for today if you are
interested in to our virtual conference

below is going to start this weekend so
make sure to grab your tickets and I
will see you guys in the next one

pay attention to the volume because we
actually what's up guys Steven dr. so
today we're going to talk about a bunch
of plays from the corona virus and
there's a lot of tickers I've been
playing over about this week I made
about 60,000 and there's a lot of
mistake being involved in and some of
the rules needs to be adjusted a bit
when you're trading into these type of
big types I'm going to give you all the
nonsense all these individual tickers
before getting this video make sure to
click the like button subscribe our
comforts are getting changed from New
York to Cincinnati or you know higher
due to the corona virus so this is the
last one for you to get the tickets and
make sure to grab your chance and it's
getting to the video all right so let's
get into today's ticker and we have
about several a lotta tickers overall
since February we have about 200 tickers
and including all those meter readers
which is apt a HPI and co DX now let's
go into these stickers and one by one
then three of those tickers react a
little bit different according to the
virus news and all those press releases
and let's get into a PT first so apt was
the higher priced stocks and they
dropped much faster and harder and also
it didn't really bounce that much and
let's look at a HPI and co DX so co DX
is relatively cheaper prized HPA has the
lowest flow compared to a PT and c OT x
so let's category them first we want to
look at the best one to short with when
they're trying to shift the momentum
from going along too short you want to
pick the ones that has the highest price
first second has the biggest flow
overall because of the hype when there's
not enough demand for a stock when
they're trying to drop higher flow
higher priced stocks will help the
statute drop down faster
first is because since the price is so
expensive
people cannot buy a lot of shares let's
say I have 10,000
and I can only buy about maybe 500
shares or even lower and I can buy maybe
a thousand shares on sale TX and maybe a
thousand shares on a HP I so since the
price are so expensive I can buy less
shares when there's less shares and
there's a big flow and there's not
enough demand if there's a lot of people
trying to buy and that doesn't make
sense because the price is so expensive
I came by last year's and if there's so
much supply and lower demand the stock
will likely to drop so HP T is the one
that has the lowest bounce rate you can
see dropped from basically from 40 to 12
in two days so apt will be my priority
to short when the momentum is trying to
shift now this one will probably be my
bigger size which I made about roughly
60,000 on a PT and co DX is the other
one that was playing a bit weird a sale
DX will probably the second take our
long t-shirt into and follow with HPI
because HP has the lowest flow when
there is low supply and higher demand
the stock like to bounce a lot you can
see according to March 4th and March 1st
each morning spike can spike about 30 to
40% due to the low flow same thing goes
to 0 DX this one didn't really expect
that far on expect about 30 percent and
20 percent that apt only spite about 10
percent you can see the different
tickers on there bouncing percentages to
be able to tell which one has the higher
flow which one has the higher supply and
you can use that flow supply and price
range to pick which one is your priority
which one is your second priority and
which one is your last priority no now
which ticker is your last ticker you
want to trade now after that let's talk
about resistance so apt resistance are
majorly formed around 26 to $20 ish now
every time when you find this backed
into that 22 23 it always felt but I
don't really recommend trading in the
afternoon because trading afternoon will
destroy the odds of being you know
you sure into resistance so morning's
plaque like this is easy to surely into
more inspect like this also easy to
showing into but we're not trying to
sure into multiple spikes and each time
the stock will reduce its own range you
can see the total range of apt March
third was between 12 to 21 the range by
itself and a second day reduced about
half only range will be 20 to 15 now
today's even tighter you can see it's
only between 18 to 16 when the range
gets tighter and tighter it's not worth
it to show any Mercer apt in the future
you kind of have to wait until you know
you lose this entire moment and goes
back to 403 then shorting into all those
resistance around 10 so in this case
we're not really into this type of hype
apt it's not up heard anymore for me now
let's look at Co DX so sale DX is a
little bit different compared to apt
this one was little bit stubborn
they held 50% again or above and being
consolidated in there every single day
the stock itself is also tricky
yesterday he went from 13 to 11 now 11
was the last support for this ticker and
this morning did a press release and
gapped up the stock and squeezed the
shorts but doesn't really seem like he
can break this $14 area we can see the
majority of the consolidation are always
formed around 15 to 14 between 11 to 15
now it's awkwardly stuck in between the
support and resistance and has nowhere
to go and there's high volume being
camped in to the area as well so it's on
sale DX is going to be really tough to
read in the next couple days I think
once the stock cracks to 11 and you can
see the know about a week chart still
has do some on a risk/reward to fall
back into maybe five or four so Scylla
Dix has the highest potential reward for
shorting and apt is not now HP is same
thing it's very similar to apt just a
bigger volatility version also
HP I involved higher range compared to
apt it removes more up and down compared
to a
and since the corona virus is still
going and all of those tickers cannot
neutralize they sell you because it
dropped pretty much always so again now
it's trying to consolidate and when
start trying to consolidate and the
fundamental of the virus are still going
and I think in the next couple days
we'll do like a decent bounce bounce
back to maybe 32
Tony a but I don't think you will bounce
all the way back and trying to break
that the high I don't because it's ready
so much volume disc and oh it's going to
be very difficult to break into that and
so call the back waters that was trapped
in the 40 and 30 ish so overall I think
coronavirus sector is kind of dead for
now so ditch probably has the highest
reward for shorting it also has to be
really careful because the stock song SS
are pretty much all the time is trying
to release a PR so I wouldn't really
recommend holding ashore overnight and
this one will eventually do offering and
the future will be a put in short as
well and now let's look at IP l during
this time in March we had a lot of
volume between them back and forth make
sure a pay attention to the volume and
the normal volume we get is typically
around 15 million is 60 million that's
like the maximum on the intraday now
we're getting about three times as much
volume compared to the last month or
last year and you can kind of tell you
know when you are trading into the first
screen that second green day you're
expecting three times volume that means
the three times of demand compared to
normal so we're not on your Shore first
and second Green Day that's basically
suicide wieners down much demand and
tiny amount of flow for something like I
be Al and HPI
is going to be very difficult eroding
into and it's likely to blow up your
account in this case I wouldn't really
recommend trying to shore into any type
of taker until this hype is over then
you can use them as resistance you sure
into the future that's going to be much
easier compared to 2000 right now so
that's pretty much all the analysis for
all the croon of our stocks hopefully
you guys stay safe it will still
probably have another 1 or 2 weeks of
all this hype and still we have a lot of
potential play in coming into the next
month or two and
never showing the first Green Day and do
not shore into any
type of hives or maybe like a week
morning panic because there's a lot of
volume volcana just morning pain really
easy and thank you very much for
watching and I will see you guys in the
next one

first major mistakes you make the second
thought is I want to make that money
back now as soon as you have that second
thought you make the second mistake then
it's a chain reaction you keep making
mistakes until you blow up your account
the way to deal with that just shut down
your computer and come back fresh the
next day and now people can't do that
it's very difficult to control your
emotions uh especially you're playing
with real money but it just takes
practices it seems as though when you

what's up guys even ducks here and today
we're gonna talk about moment in ships
the two stocks we want to talk about you
and Artie and B for past week and a half
and this is a really hot patterns for
this couple of days they are they have
the similar patterns and what once you
recognize the weakness you can make a
decent money on a downside and you can
also make money on the upside as well
and let's start with RT and B as last
video I talked about the momentum decent
momentum and when you try to short this
heavy heavy voluntary stock it's hard to
judge when it's the momentum is going to
shift so buy the stuff habits every
single morning it's going to have a
squeeze so when the stock repeats itself
two times on the third times most likely
to do the same thing again especially
for consistently couple days so I'm Paul
gets 21st if you see a morning spike
come back down morning spike came back
down now on the third day
okay typically when you see the tooth to
that that did the same thing and the
third day expects it to almost three
dollars so for this kind of momentum
when the stock repeats is to morning
spikes and to morning squeezes at the
same time third day try not to short his
before the market opened it's a
potential tip buy because stock is
likely to behave once it would behave
what she's going to do early on so same
thing the fourth time so when stock
repeats the same move over and over
again then you have to adapt it to the
stock as well
once the morning spiked every single
morning spiked felled pretty hardcore so
this one failed as well so to trade to
be able to trade August 21st but to
August 25th just try to attack to the
momentum so August first morning spike
ok second morning spike August 23rd
morning spike so I typically participate
in the third day when he tried to do the
same thing again again and again so I
know it's going to morning's fight
because it did twice hi odds of winning
so I did bad shorted started behaves
very similar for past couple days now
after the third time I'm down shorting
or buying and I'm going to keep watch
the patterns if to see if the momentum
switch or not
Orlov or a pattern behaves differently
so on the fourth day more inspect did
not change and I know spec doesn't hold
so sure little again and that's where
the well you know what the stock is
going to behave like just you can take a
little advantage on the downside or the
upside as well so now on the fifth day
the stock is morning spiking in the
morning so you know the stock doesn't it
never holds this morning spike
so shorting to morning spike came back
down again so this is this is something
you can't actually pay attention to when
trading those kind of momentum stocks
watch the previous two days how they
behave and it's most likely to do the
same thing on the third day so two
examples on 21st 22nd 23rd least a third
example and you replace the 30 day
example into the first one so 23rd will
be the first first example 24th will be
the second example and 25th
it's going to repeat what today for the
past two days so easy predictable
patterns but try to try to keep keep
keep close eye and watch the previous
two days and on the 25th you can use
this third example replace to the first
attempt oh so morning spike fail okay
and you had a huge gap down in the
pre-market
same thing stuck like the stock sorry
morning spike if it spikes now when it
opens morning spike fail again and
predict the patterns you know stock
neighborhoodies morning spike second day
when the stock is spiking in the
pre-market
I do count as a morning spike so if the
stock already more than inspecting a pre
market once the market opens it doesn't
need to have a morning spec anymore
because already more inspecting the pre
market
so pre market spikes replace the morning
spike that's what I typically do so
shorting the morning spike again
and because you know the stuff doesn't
hold morning specs you can just take
that one on advantage and shorting into
me resistance over and over again and
for our tmb you can make you a lot of
money on a downside and on upside
because you know what exactly the stocks
going to behave for for a couple of days
and down lnu
same thing very hot patterns for past
couple days yeah you get all did a big
morning spike to a 250 come back down
morning spike again come back down so
this is a little bit different than our
tmb now if you draw a horizontal line
right here you can clear clear see where
the support is and where the resistance
is the support is that one ninety one
ninety to one hundred two ish the
resistance is around 250 ish when the
stock behaves twice in two days it's
typically going to behave in a third day
but on the third day the stock did not
morning spike he in turn turned around
you know about 10:30 and tried to spike
again now to the little bit difference
is on the August 30th typically the
afternoon and the stock did not fade for
in the afternoon I actually tried to
bounce it back to almost to the main
resistance level and you can clear see
one that 184 is the clear dip so on the
first day in clearly a whole 184
185 as a dip as well so for L on you
when the stock behaves twice for two
days and the third day it's going to
behave the same thing but what happens
if the stock panicked and most people
will believe the stock will do the same
thing and what what do you think what
what they would do they would dip by the
dip and hoping for a delayed spike
that's why exactly Ella I mean dude did
I get thirty first it dipped down to 180
because you always try to buy before the
support area so if you to support is
118:25 185 the support is 185 try to buy
a 180 that's why I Holly dipped to 190
and respected to mean resistance level
now I didn't short this spike because I
hate to be resistant is it mean the
resistance level because I don't want it
to form a cup of handle on me which is a
super bowl a sign and you never know how
much shorts are stuck in this you so put
this trigger will be very very dangerous
for me and not comfortable pulling this
trigger because the the squeeze was not
far enough and in my teens
you might can squeeze further to break
250 and do like a couple handle squeeze
above three dollars so when the stock
squeeze it to the same resistance level
for previous couple days especially now
under it at the same resistance so if
the resistance is to for 250 and squeeze
it to 250
I wouldn't short there because it's too
much of short squeeze but if the stock
for pretty
couple days is 250 bye-bye squeeze that
you 2:30 you know people are shorting
this before the main resistance area and
the squeeze was not that strong didn't
test at the top of the resistance level
so if it's under it I'm pretty
comfortable too short little bit
underneath of resistance but if they are
the same exactly level typically I won't
take a short so that's just my personal
personal method I don't like to take
bigger risk so as you can see August
31st went up to 250 and dip down to 193
so the same thing landed on the same
support level so when people try to dip
by and when the when the clearly support
failure will cause a morning panic so
for RT and B is 11 you start typically
behaves 3 days so the one day you can
take advantage on its a third day first
time behave second time behave so you
know what the stock is going to do in
the third day RT and B as well so take a
little advantage August 23rd take
advantage on its 25th yeah and you can
take the advantage on August 22 31st so
for I think on Tuesday when it starts to
stock market opens you know when when
the support brakes become a solid
resistance so 183 will become will
become the resistance for a allowing you
and you will go down further maybe to
the 150 to test this button on Tuesday
that's just my thoughts it's another
pattern but it's actually a pattern let
the patterns show yourself and take a
little advantage
after the path after the stock shows you
what kind of pattern if it is then you
can take advantage from there it just in
stock market history always repeated you
repeated by itself so and people
thinking a still think in the same way
if the stop it like repeat twice it's
always going it's not always but I will
say 70% of its chance you were going to
repeat in the next day or you know next
month
so that's why when stock has so many
failed spike you know hit before in the
history that's why stock doesn't hold
spikes that very well because people see
the history so keep that in mind and
next one is next one I'm going to talk
about the RO is very very simple
strategy stock had a bad news
I think it's the they're issuing 100
meeting shares at 275 and the stock
tanked all the way to 210 bounced you
first thing the stock market nothing
goes straight up nothing goes straight
down if you go straight up it's going to
be have a pullback if it goes straight
down it's going to have a bounce and
when dr is bounced because dr o has went
straight down so he bounced to almost
280 and i picked an entry at 280 because
I do want to risk a round number two
short into the mini resistance area if
you look at a one-month chart to minute
the entire mean resistance is around to
$3.00
so surely in three dollars very good
risk reward I'm risking 20 cents to make
potentially 50 cents or 60 cents once it
takes out that three years level and
this this three area becomes a huge
resistance I don't think you can one
I don't think stock can break one month
resistance in one day so that's just
typically how stock behaves and I picked
the entry at 280 sure the interior
covered most of it to 60-ish and on the
next day he actually was a great short
again because the stock is holding at
270 level so basically if you short here
you're risking 30 cents to make a
potential 3050 actually 50 cents so that
bad risk reward solid resistance showing
that it's shorting into resistance is
always a good strategy and for this kind
of multi month actually multi weeks
Motorbooks resistance typically it's
hard to break that in what in one
intraday so keep that in mind and those
are the two patterns I need to go over
with
maybe next couple weeks we'll have those
patterns will happen again and make sure
take advantage on the third day when the
stock keeps repeating repeats its own
pattern so there it's very predictable
and just make sure position yours size
charactery never never go too big it's
never worth it to go broke on one sucks
so same thing as dris if you typically
this is not for low flow stocks
it's a little bit for mid-cap so if
stock has a bad news bounced right back
to motive month or a multi-year more two
weeks resistance and it's a pretty solid
risk reward strategy most of the time
okay I would say 75% of the chance that
start pulls back after the big bounces
so that's the lesson for for today and I
will see you guys next week

what's all guys given dr. now welcome to
the next YouTube videos and today I'll
talk about how to really move down your
risk and how do you use statistics
binding with different patterns and how
to really recognize that trends has
already formed when the stock decides to
reverse on you and this is how you react
and the moving down risk is really good
different and more shares into your
original positions so before I get into
this video before you guys really like
the previous one it's just for beginners
most of you guys that I considered that
beginners so if you want to know more
about statistics there's the link below
and can take you straight to either you
can watch training techniques or you can
watch Chuck cylinder those two DVDs are
really good for beginners and how to
retry statistics if you're interested
click the link below and it's getting
too much you move down risks when you
see a chart is forming a specific
pattern or it is doing its own thing
bowing the first 30 minutes or 20
minutes and most of the time you will
see the trends has already formed the
first 30 minutes so either it does a
huge spike or a huge panic most spiky
and failed in percentages are typically
happens in the first 30 minutes of the
day s ing for example you see the chart
did a massive panic it doesn't really
matter if you got into a tray or didn't
get into a trade it doesn't matter what
pattern it is but you can see when the
stock opened up and you can see this
massive amount of volume naturally in
the open and it consolidated it for a
little bit and crack through right at
open prices so in this case you can kind
of think going to a chart and think
about it so when people either you're
abusing Robin Hood or you are using TV
Ameritrade those two brokers came out
sizing in the pre-market owing after
hour so when they see a stock is
potential Bowditch and you see a massive
spike right after open typical people
will just straight chase into a stock it
means they want to buy into your stock
let's say for the best guy in that buy
right at the open will be at 2.40 6 so
let's assume the first guy polyp 2.46
and he see the stock is spiking is happy
and sangha study says the crap
to 2.46 or 2.45 he will get nervous
because he's afraid of the stock he's
gonna draw more and it's gonna be down
money on the day so when I see a
position that I was winning at the
beginning then sorry I'm breaking even I
want to cut my losses that's her first
mentality because they don't want to
lose money they want color even at least
so when the start dumps to this point
it means typically means stock is on a
downtrend level and when you are using
specific pattern and can use these
people's mentality that a lot of people
who purchase very open around the water
and if you are using specific pattern is
a short at three then you're looking to
add more and you can tell people are
under water so when start decides to
bounce into two points ever and I can
know people who bought it at 2.7 or two
point eight they wants to sell to break
even
that's where the huge certain pressure
coming from so this panic was predicted
that's why I can add into here so when
you add let's say 2.6 and of course if
let's say short at three and you add at
two point six your average won't be
asked me anymore you were average will
be around 2.8 now it's four more nine
right here and it says here will be your
average so to pollenate you add at two
point six right now if it's me I will
move down my risk it means that
typically if I'm risking this double top
that when I cut my losses
I will be down money or be negative but
if I decide to add two point secular to
point it said they said you add
perfectly at a at two point five nine
then my average will be draw down to two
point eight now right now when the
stocks are down trend the risk will be
readjust
into 2.66 is because stock already
formed another top and if the status has
to come back or above that level again I
will be coming analysis if I cut my
losses because my entry is a two point
eight it means I will be
not trading as green so this is how you
really protect yourself when the stock
already formed the trend and you feel
decides to add adding into a winner
typically will give you more winning if
the stock is going against you then all
your emotional decisions are involved in
that's where you make a really bad entry
and exit so in this case starts
throughout the day it didn't really
break that 2.66 area I decide to test
the area again and straight failed so if
you shoot so if you are shorting and if
you added always leave something as your
risk if you decide to move down your
risk and this risk has to be very
specific level on the chart so let's say
if you decide at it into a rent Orenda
now you see the size panic anything is
going to draw more you didn't really
think about why your average is going to
be let's say you add it at 2.36 and if
you initial entry will be 3 your average
will be drawdown - 2.52 that means to
let's say 2.52 2.55 then your risk will
be around 2.66 so if the stock decides
to push above 2.66 then you will be down
this 2.66 it's a very it's a key level
you can see on the chart you will always
want your average position will be
little bit above that key point of the
risk levels you're always gonna give
yourself little bit room if the stock
tends to go against you and you have
that little bit of room of recorded to
cover or to exit your positions same
thing goes with long so let's say if you
buy a very low and decides to add in
your panic always pick that very key
level a little bit under the tip key
level a little bit above the key level
for shorting so in that way if the sub
tends to go against you you will be
coming out a small green or color even
because it's said we have a lot of
shares if you want to add to the stock
the stock needs to have enough liquidity
get out if there is really thin equity
then getting out would be really
difficult it's gonna affect the stock
price that's why you always want to
leave a room for you and your entry
needs to be above the key level
let's talk about some charts a lot of
people already pay attention to so when
the first thing we look at the stock
market you want to look at the entire
historical charts because you want to
know what the stock did in the past
couple years or so but for me I took a
look within a year so I don't really
look before a year ago and now if you
see this consistent downtrend chart that
stuff was going down pretty much every
single day then you see this massive
drawdown and another of consistent on
trend charts if the stock is trading
decent amount of volume every single day
it means people are holding in different
levels so you can't really tell where
people are holding so when a star tends
to reverse again you don't have that
concentrated level of sellers let's say
some people holding on for some people
for holding a safe some people holding a
nine
and when the stock decides to come back
again and stock was already on the
consistent down trend chart
he already 0.74 that means in this level
the stock was down training so much and
the people who are holding in there are
very desperate when they are desperate
they are tempting to hold for example if
I tempted to hold a stock I bought a
stock at you and the stock went to 0.5
in that case I would think I'm stupid
very stupid I didn't really come
analysis and I'm already holding that
0.5 well what's the worst equals to 0
and what was pretty much all my
investment if the stock is already at
zero point I am already done so much I
was just my just holding a stock to the
hoping for it to spike again so now I
caught a - some people bought a 5 or 8
and when the side tends to spike again I
want the stock spikes to my level which
means I won't let's say I bought a stock
at you I want to sell spike to you to be
able to cut even some people bought a
floor suspect thank you for to color
even and when you see this consistent
downtrend charts you don't really see
concentrated sellers that means people
are pretty much sellers are everywhere
so when you're trying to predict the top
of these type of charts instead when the
gap up or do what everything's I'm goes
to parabolic
our entry day based on this type of come
down to inconsistent charts it's very
very difficult because you can't really
find where the setter is so for
something like this if there's settles
every words trading that's a one meaning
or 300k shares per day then there's
about let's say thirty meaning overall
people are quitting in four six eight if
the star tends to go parabolic and
training a lot of volume it's really
difficult to overwhelm all those setters
that means the stock at unlikely to
suspect that hi and also you can't
really predict where the setter is where
the resistance level is that means the
science is not retreat about so when you
are looking at a ticker you always want
to look at the technical side you want
to look at the fundamental side
technical side it's very important and
in the first few days if the statins do
spike so the priority is for technicals
overwhelms fundamentals the Unitarian
fundamentals over warms technicals we
want to trade short-term technical
analysis is always the one you are
looking at that be my tips for today
hopefully this video helps I will see
you guys next time

hello guys steven dexter welcome to this
new youtube episode
today we're going to talk about the
definition of adapting into the current
market
also the different trading seasons
throughout the year so before i start
this video make sure to click the like
button and subscribe
it's going to really help our youtube
channel to give more free content
[Music]
so have you ever noticed that in
different seasons
you see there's perfect criteria laid
out everywhere and you're making tons of
money and you're on a winning streak
and some seasons you are currently
making a good trade but
the stock didn't really perform the way
you expected
then the few times that you feel like
there's
consistent trades that does not follow
the pattern at all and you're starting
on a losing streak you're losing
confidence on trading as well
so these type of trades are all related
to different trading seasons
and i'm going to give you the last five
year statistics
to show how to really perform better in
two different trading seasons
so the first season was starting around
november november to
february typically before the end of the
year
everybody wants to make a trade before
the big holiday and that's where
majority of the trades comes from tons
of volume tons of volatility
typically one or two major squeezes but
generally
market is really good if you're patient
enough then we're heading into january
or february
january are typically the month that
majority of the company already filed
their losses
so they want to raise money in the
market as soon as possible
to be able to gain the money from the
investors in that month
in that way they will hire a tons of
promoters
to promote their stocks to be able to
sell warrants
or do offering to the investor that
doesn't really know about the stock
fundamental
so the second season starting around
mid-february to
june in those months the markets are
really slow there's about
one or two major trades but nothing big
happening in those couple months then
after june we start to transition
into average market during the average
market we will have about
two to three trades a week during the
transition
that's where majority of the people make
their mistakes and that's where
the major supernova comes from because
if you're not patient enough
and everybody is getting used to that
boring market season
and all of a sudden they're too eager to
get into a trade when the right
opportunity decides to come
then that's where they take majority of
the losses of the year
so the transition between different
market seasons is
really important so when you see a stock
is increasing volume
significantly then i suggest you do not
touch that one
until you see about one or two trades
after
you get used to the present market
condition that's how you're supposed to
trade
then we're heading into august
to october which is what we currently
are and we've seen the markets been
really really boring nothing is really
happening
and a lot of people are eager to make a
trade we're right
at the transitions right now if you are
impatient and want to make a trade
that's where you are creating
opportunity for people who are patient
enough to make money from so
as an experienced trader that's what i
suggest to not
really touch between the transition
season and that's very important
i make those major mistakes pretty much
all the time
so for the last two or three years i
started finding
the correct statistics and how to really
use the correct
method to treat into different seasons
so the second point on the cover will be
the definition of adapting into the
current market how do you really adapt
into the market
people are really asking that question
to themselves
because they don't really know how to
they're just observing
and depending on what they see they will
start to make
corrections on their trades now that's
very important for beginners
and for experienced traders as well
because if you see the last 10 trades
that is very boring as soon as they open
and
start dying in the first five minutes
did not produce a bounce as well
if they see that for 10 times they were
likely to place a trade
then that doesn't fit their criteria but
they see for the last 10 times it
repeated
and all of a sudden everybody will think
the same
and when everybody thinks the same
that's where they become 90
of the people that lose money in the
market that's where
the stock decides to reverse and squeeze
the tons of people
and the original opportunity supernova
comes from
these type of people are making mistakes
so how do you really adapt into the
current market
personally i have this one method that
can really help you
to be able to have a clue about how the
market is really changing
as i said if you are noticing for the
last 10 trades
if nothing has changed and of the sudden
the volume is significantly increasing
that's where you stop trading and you
want to track down your statistics
and to be able to track the average
volume
because the average volume supposed to
give you idea
of okay this is the average volume can
be traded
in a day so if i tend to
buy a stock and stock is already meeting
the average volume
in the first 10 minutes that means the
stock is likely to trade much more
volume
later on so if i see that and
i have this average volume it is not
fitting the current
market then this stock is not going to
be tradable let me give you an example
so let's say i track for the last two
months or three months
the average volume in the day will be
around 20 million to 50 million right
in the last two days i've seen a ticker
that trades about 50 million shares
in the first two hours then i would
definitely know okay well
today is definitely going to trade over
100 million shares
because you already traded 50 million in
the first two hours what will happen in
the next
uh five hours so for the average volume
if you see a computer change
that's where you stop trading close down
your platform
put all that statistics in your sheets
and be able to slowly adapt into the
current market by tracking the average
volume
it should take you about two to three
weeks to get used to the current volume
if you notice of my training
performances in 2020
for the first three or four months i'm
not making
the bigger trade i'm making 400k in my
trade or
300k in one trade making 1.5 million
dollars in one month
no because i'm trying to getting used to
the current market conditions
when the market came in in 2020 i'm very
confused because i don't know what to do
with this type of volume
and it will take me time to get used to
it a lot of people will see the volume
but they don't really know how to really
trade it and they will still
trade it when they don't know the market
and you're trying to make money for
something that you don't really know
then that's where you start to lose
money so those are the tips that i can
give
for how to really adapt into the current
market and also
be able to prepare in different market
seasons so as i said we're currently
between
the transition in the second season so
be patient
don't be the first one making mistakes
and thanks for watching i will see you
guys in the next time

================================================

Language: en
what's up guys Steven dr. so today we're
going to talk about what's going on in
the market and recently you have a lot
of runners CEO DX a HPI
and a PT all those are based on
coronavirus and overall general markets
reacting to this virus as well and I'm
going to talk about couple concepts and
my general experience about the overall
market so basically for the last couple
of weeks we have experienced a HPI apt
and CEO DX now all those stickers are
the major runners from this coronavirus
now let's talk about the general market
reacting to the pinyon and now penny
stocks are generally that stats are
based around $5 $6 and they can run up
to fourteen twenty and thirty dollars in
a day at the same concept or same rules
all the stickers are based on hype a
Bankstown mother and daughter had been
charged after a fight over toilet paper
in Woolworths
[Music]
so now the entire industry is getting
affected by this karana virus so the
general industry is not a hype because
it's actually affecting people's general
life for this type of takers that were
trading right now generally around
during the meeting and cap or four on
your meeting cap when those takers are
trading about 20 minutes or 30 minutes
or 80 miniatures in a day and they can
gain about couple thousand percent in
those days those type of gains are hypes
so you can see although stickers are
doing offerings Theo DX is offering and
SPE X Co CP those two takers that are
into the offering which directly affect
people trying to buy those stocks now
recently we are focused on this type of
industry there's couple strategies are
involved in here there's no ETA break
out runners now mo TT break governors
are very benefit to people that have a
small account and the one thing you want
to look at is they don't really gain
that much percentages in a row so let's
say we have a resistance at two and they
break out that two resistance and didn't
really go that far
so for all those type of plays it's a
potential swing you can buy the breakout
reach the breakout level and just
basically write the train now apt HPI
say o DX
SP x of them do the same thing focus on
more detail runners right now is the
best odds for you to potentially gain a
lot of money from this type of industry
or this type of hype so another thing I
want to talk about people are kind of
freaked out from this virus and all they
do is they are purchasing the shares
from all those hyped up tickers and each
day we're trading a team in ensures 100
million shares now if you are smart and
if you are short sellers and let the
chart form first because once the chart
forms and eventually what turning into a
shady company or offering they will drop
to where the beginning expect from like
CEO DX you expect from five to twenty
and now it's about ten right now the
next few weeks probably will drop to
five again
so within this type mount of time and
other people are trading in that type of
price tone majority people are stuck
around fifteen sixteen dollar area once
you wait that resistance to form and
people will keep thinking the stock will
come back up witnessed a comeback optic
they're sure again to cut it even so
this is your opportunity or the best
opportunity to do short sales so there's
a couple of strategies you can play off
either you can play the multi-day
runners that didn't really around
thousands of percent in the first day so
if it's under 50% 100% and the beginning
stage of being running then focus on
number two their breakout you can get a
lot of reward on that now once you
waited for this entire have to be over
and you wanna shore into these several
resistance yes you can do that as well
so either it can be patient it can be
not patient and with different strategy
focuses on different counts so shorts
that you can focus on more in a bigger
accounts and the multi breakout are more
focusing on small counts people are
asking about what do I think about
overall market generally I don't trade
an SMP at all and based on this type of
ours we can use to only references from
2008 and that's the only references you
have so by statistics it's not that
predictable
so dementia in the market will come back
their suppliers will go away but just
dependent on how long they last and
overall I think this type of virus it
will cause a lot of hype seeing opinion
and there's going to be a lot of
resistance being formed a lot of runners
going to be running and it's going to
create a lot of opportunity depends on
if you can catch her or not so right now
we're building this type of platform
that can help you to scan for listable
multi-tier runners or potential sure
that stocks is running into a major
resistance so you don't have to go out
and looking for the patterns and judge
your eyes and we will have AI system can
automatically recognize the pattern for
you so you very interested the platform
will be introduced to you guys during
the spring fixture registered email so
we'll give a discount for the first
thousand people who are signing up for
this scanner and that's the opponent if
we're being through this never had many
times we've been through bola hives
we've been through shipping companies
hype and we've been through biotech help
as well so the same thing will happen
over and over again it will spike
massively then we'll start dropping
again and bounce few times and you
offering and start doing reverse splits
that's what micro cap stocks always do
so make sure to be careful we're
treating this type of hives and the
extension will be always bigger than you
think and if you think the stock will
spike about 70%
going to spike about 100% of reality so
always be impatient and find out the
correct player you want to play because
there is a lot of opportunities so
select your opportunity first before you
try to jump into every single
opportunity the real thing is you can't
catch every single opportunity so you
can get these selectively choose the one
that has the highest winning percentage
and be safe
thank you very much and we'll see you
guys next time

SOURCE VIDEO: How to Predict and Apply Market Cycles. Day Trading [HtCc391BQ0k].en.vtt
================================================

Language: en
hello guys dim dax here welcome to this
new youtube video today i'm going to
talk about how to really take advantage
of the next market cycle and also how to
find the correct timing of it
before i start this video we have a
conference coming up in november 14th to
16th
so make sure to grab your opportunity
and let's get into the video so in this
video
i'm going to generally talk about my
market experience because
it is very important that it's related
to the market cycle we're having
in 2020. so at the beginning of the
cycle we'll
have a series of boring season and once
the short setter gets eager to
push a trade and all of a sudden that
they will get
massive short squeeze like i'm going to
talk about
in the video i like apvo once they get
squeezed they will give all
the people that are trying to go along
and they see a ticker that's producing
a thousand two thousand percent again in
a day then that
also will give them hope to be able to
think
that maybe the next play will be the
same ticker
as how it performed like for example a
pvo
and that's where the patient short
sellers will start to take advantage
of all the people that trying to go
along and maybe they're
long into massive resistance and that's
where
once the lawns start to lose their money
again then the
inpatient short-seller starts to bring
the market cycle back again
and that is a consistent loop will
rotate about three to four times during
the year
let me give you an example so in this
week we have a pvo
this is a super runner it actually went
from
five to eighty dollars in a week and
normally that's when we're looking at
after our runner or afternoon runner
especially
when the stock decides to spike after 2
30 and close really strong
and didn't really have any type of
action at the
beginning of the day this is the type of
ticker you will never want to short into
it's because well first of all you don't
really know where
all the buyer is and second apbo was
producing really low liquidity in that
day
if the ticker has really loaded quality
it's really difficult to short and the
spread is going to be
really wild and that's a big no
especially for
long and short traders if you really
want to launch a pvo
i suggest to choose something that have
higher liquidity definitely has to trade
about 50 million shares in
a day for you to have a decent entry
and exit so you can kind of see the
habit of apvo
each day it starts to spike in the
midday or in the late afternoon
this first green day went from seven to
fourteen second green that went from
nine to
nineteen then starting speck in the
midday again
uh 15 to 22. see in this case
if the support are way too close to
where you're supposed to drop now what
does that even mean so first of all when
you want to spot a momentum shift
you want to look for a decent range for
the short interview which
the point you want to show into is very
far from the support area
in this case apbo expected from 10
to 17 and that is the minimum specking
percentage for
breaking now off the support the minimum
extension you need
is around 60 to 70 percent and you need
a massive amount of volume
to actually trade in the top
consolidation before you short into
resistance
so apv didn't really consolidate at all
can see that one from 9
to 19 consolidated little bit
less than two hours and only traded
about
maybe five to ten million volume and
that is not
enough to make the stock drop because it
didn't trap enough back odors
so it just keep consistently doing the
weird breakouts and now on the friday
you can see that you did actually a fake
outfit
through the entire day so my take
on these type of multi-day rounders
first of all if the beginnings
biking behavior is not correct which i
mentioned about earlier in this video
if they decide to spike in afternoon
then it's a not very good
shorting opportunity and also when you
also want to go along for these type of
tickers you want to look for
enough liquidity also and apbo didn't
provide that
and this is how market starts the next
cycle because people are eager to catch
the opportunity that they
don't really want to pay attention to
the liquidity
or the charting behavior and that's
where they're making
the major mistakes so in the late friday
the company
um filed the 13d correct me if i'm wrong
they announced how much was the inside
holder percentage
and of the stud and the stock went from
24 to 80.
wouldn't stop going from 24 to 80
especially in the after hour
really low quality if you are shorting
apbo you are basically trying to
take the ask by yourself and you are
pushing
the ask so quickly because there is
really low liquidity
and also the stock didn't really
generate that much volume
on intraday and then we're heading after
hours as
that's even worse so going to the next
monday
with all the volatility in the market
after the
election is over and we also have apvo
bring the market back
and that's where the predictable pattern
is going to come
in the next about two to three weeks so
make sure
study your statistics always focus on
charting behavior
and the liquidity also that's two very
important factor for you to be able to
trade
very good in this industry so that will
be of the content i want to cover today
make sure to grab that latest conference
ticket and i will see you guys in the
next video

SOURCE VIDEO: How to Profit from Multi-Day Runners with a Smaller Account. [pc5K880BxSc].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
so GN us is one of the perfect examples
for multi-day runners and right now
what's up guys Stillman dr. so today
we're going to talk about multi-day
runners I do see a lot of people have
problems asking me how do I really trade
them so today I'm going to list couple
criterias me to follow and some of the
rules you have to follow as well before
I get into this video let's start off
with the criteria first so first off
when you are looking at watch the
runners you won't look for the accurate
market caps and depends on where you
want to shore into different market cap
zones I would recommend the beginning
cap which has to be around 10 to 100
median then the flow has to be anywhere
between 10 to 15 minutes anywhere
between 10 to 100 minute it's okay
if it's over 100 meeting it gets a
little bit tricky since so it has to get
really crowded for it to become a low
rotation stock and if it goes out of 100
median it doesn't really meet ideal
range secondly willing to look for the
minimum extension for motility runners
now typically I use anywhere between
2,000 to 3,000 percent as a minimum
follow after this I will give you guys
examples of how to really spot for
maximum extensions and you will be
examples for that until the next point
once you find the max extensions and
accurate market caps and flow you want
to focus on where's the key points of
the stock can naturally break its own
momentum and one look for where is the
major support sometimes the stock
decides to do 50% then actually come
back I will get into a later of how to
really find accurate key points there's
about 10 to 15% of times that can
actually come back and break its own day
high so in terms of risk reward he has
to be really careful to be comfortable
with your risk and reward at the same
time so remember these couple points
before I get into the video the accurate
market caps anywhere between 10 to 100
million as a starting cap flow has to be
10 to 20 million second point will be
minimum extension range will be anywhere
in 2002 3,000% their points on yourself
you want to find at which point the
stock is likely to break its momentum
and where you shall cover as a maximum
reward once we put this couple points
your head let's get into the actual
examples so join us will be one of the
perfect samples for multi day runners
before you look at the chart same thing
we want to look for accurate market caps
so right now it's at four dollars so 4
divided by 400 million the starting cab
will be 100 million sorry my mistake is
400 million divided by 4 and fro is
anywhere between 10 to 100 million so
Ashley fits the criteria now let's look
for maximum extension so start it at 53
cents went to almost 12 and that's about
10,000 percent again that the actual
volume begins to trade and June second
this is where the day gets a tons of
volume
normally that type of volume on the
beginning of the spike will be
considered as ultimate support so in
this case the support will be anywhere
between 3 to 4 now once we've found the
ultimate support want to look for the
key points of the stock is likely to
lose its momentum and it's going to a 15
day chart as I said earlier when the
study says to crack its own support
which it is around $8 area right about
here and we go back on the previous day
to stock actually traded around 400 to
500 million shares on the previous day
since the market open the stock didn't
really seem like it's going to gain
enough liquidity to break the previous
day soon it's a start decides to break
that 8 this type of support become
resistance instantly shortly after a you
will be the key points of the stock
besides loose its momentum this is not
the perfect odds for multi day runner on
the first try because you're risking
basically three dollars to making
another $4 so risk your words around 1
to 1 now since you know the stock is
likely to do 75 percent to 50 percent
and you also see the supporters around 4
so dip lying around 4 is not that bad so
we did buy around for the actual selling
point will be anywhere below that $8
area so you can make about an average by
tracking statistics is around 20 to 25
percent so you can make around 20 to 25
percent right here to the balance 25%
then if you sure into the bounds we can
make another about 10 to 20 percent so
press of those percentages together you
can make in total 85 percent close to 70
percent it's actually decent reward for
a beginner to go out there account
especially you can gain a large
percentages of your original investment
so this is the classic charts for no TD
runners sometimes there's different
variations there's a maximum dollar
block that I talked about between
different market cap zones and that has
to be used in two different scenarios so
this one they file the s3 file are
introduced that's why I caused the panic
but you can still use the pattern really
well just by recognize where the key
point is so that'll be up the points for
multi their owners hopefully you guys
can take some practice into it you
should get handle bit in about two or
three times and wish you guys make some
profits off this pattern and I'll see

SOURCE VIDEO: How to Profit on a Reverse Split.  COSM [XX5MYOOi4XQ].en.vtt
================================================

[Music]
welcome to this video so today I want to
specifically talk about ticker which is
cosm that just happened last two weeks
to take a little reverse split and it
went up six thousand percent so today I
want to specifically talk about reverse
split place and uh other than that make
sure to hit the like button and
subscribe let's get into the video
so today uh this is the cosm chart uh
you can see that I started around 30
cents it went all the way to 20 up about
six thousand percent and there's pretty
much a straight slope going up no
pullback and it's a disaster for short
squeezers first of all when you'll never
you want to trade the reverse bullet you
want to see okay well
I want to look at the Historical chart
does this ticker has been doing reverse
play again and again again as you can
see and the ticker always has been doing
reverse splits a long time ago and how
reverse priority works is the ticker
reduce its float
and to either microflow or Nano float
then after that it squeezes the shorts
on the first or second Green Day then
they fit it down and they try a bunch of
bag holders then they do an offering
then they can once the stock forms
hardcore enough resistance that means
the ticker is unlikely to break through
the resistance then it will go back and
do a reverse split again to cancel the
previous resistance then reduce its
float then we can do an offering again
and again and again so that's why you
see you trade a ticker multiple times
since obviously back in 2017 2018
that is the reason of why you're trading
reverse spit pretty much all the time in
a different price level but on the same
ticker so one of the other reason is if
the taker formed a large resistance that
cannot go up to test that resistance
that means the ticker has to continue to
fade if a ticker Fades all the way down
under one daughter that means they do
not fit the NASDAQ requirement to stay
on NASDAQ so that's why they have to do
a reverse split change their price
reduce its float
um then all of a sudden the ticket is
above uh one dollar it does fit the
NASDAQ requirement and also cancel the
previous resistance so that's the
perfect method for
um pretty much pump and dump on
different tickers and especially people
can manipulate on the low flow tickers
that's the reverse with games so let's
talk about the chart on the entryway
level and this one gapped up a thousand
percent uh and I personally showed it
around 4.4 4.5 that was waited after you
reverse reversed Consolidated I showed
it after this rejection are against 5.2
I think I showed a little bit earlier uh
then added a little bit once 5.2 broke I
covered around 5.2 then pretty much from
there it wouldn't extremely parabolic
after that and from what I know is that
since some of the Brokers did not adjust
the reverse split so if you own 75k
shares in on the previous day before the
splits after the splits I think the
splits 1 to 25 that means you only have
3K shares so if you only have 3K shares
and your brokerage did not adjust it for
you that means you you are seeing a
large unrealized profit because 75k
shares instead of 3K shares so a lot of
people sold their shares of 75k but they
actually owns 3K shares that means they
win 72k shares short
that's why a lot of people got squeezed
from there is because they didn't
understand how reversible it really
works if you're a long-term holder on a
ticker and a ticker does reverse Play
Always adjust your share and also the
stock price as well if you don't see any
adjustment on your shares and stock
price then call your brokerage if they
made adjustment or not so I see a lot of
people making a mistake I was a big
mistake on not knowing how reverse fit
really works and they just try to sell
it for a large profit and it's up the
profits not theirs and also they've been
losing all their accounts because
they're sure way too much and the ticker
basically went parabolic on that gap
down huge
then once you fade it down you was
consolidating around 10 so that ticket
already dropped 75 from the top so from
there ticker is pretty much not tradable
you can see that once it broke down 10
dollars it's been staying there around
six to eight it's going back and forth
so this one will probably continue to
fade or maybe have a balance in the
future but there's no actual
consolidations there's only one around
10 but I didn't trade that much volume
in that consolidation so this
consolation is probably not usable uh
hopefully you can get a future bounce on
cosm but that will be the lessons for
reverse splits always look at your
shares and price after the adjustments
so that'll be it for this video uh thank
you very much for watching I'll see you
guys in the next one

How do you manage the mental toll of
highstakes trading, especially during a
loss or market crash?
&gt;&gt; It's difficult. I tend to listen a lot
of calm music, plays a lot of video
games. So, just keep your mind off.
&gt;&gt; Keep your mind off it
&gt;&gt; and you can't really change the past.
What you can do is to improve in the
future. You can't really just completely
ignore the losses because it's actually
a loss you have to learn from it. You
can't be too harsh to yourself because
it just damages your decision to go into
the next trade. kind of have to balance
it out. That's very important.
&gt;&gt; And as part of that is having things
outside of trading.
&gt;&gt; Meditate and do some sports, play some
tennis, then play some video games.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

[Music]
so in this video I'm going to talk about
what's the most effective way to trade
the recent biotech Runners and also how
to really manage your risk so no takers
for this video but just going through my
personal observations and the method of
treating them in specifically uh going
to the New Years of 2023 after I
observed the entire year of 2022
so in 2022 especially after August
pretty much all the liquidity started
dropping and we haven't seen a ticker
that has any type of big Edge uh in the
last four months or so so ever since
bbby and amtd no actual tickers that can
trade 200 million volume above you know
five dollars so in this in a boring
period And there's a lot of tickers
that's going either has trading 800
million you know in terms of Dollar Wise
in one day or trading 30 million uh in
one day so there's a massive jump from
how much you can trade in one day so the
data Itself by tracking statistics are
not very stable I've been personally
getting you know a little bit annoyed
with it because well if there's no
stable statistics and every day we're
going you know up 800 million dollar
range to 30 million dollar range then
it's impossible to you know get a 10 of
well sometimes if the stock trades let's
say in average it trades around 600
million then Max which is 800 million
you can kind of get you know the hint of
how to really approach into the best
entries and uh to use that Dollar Wise
to predict how much the stock can go and
where's the momentum is likely to shift
but in this especially in the last four
months it's not like that and when the
data is not stable and when there's not
enough place a lot of people being
feeling really formal and they've been
forcing trades left and right I have
seen tickers I've gone up six thousand
percent in one day and had the offering
the next day people did not catch the
downside and they were forcing trade
going to the next one that's how cosm
happened then they're forcing trades on
kala so you can kind of see a Trader's
Behavior based on
how much fun is being traded and also
the you know the chart actions as well
so in terms of how to really manage your
risk it's pretty the normal way I still
don't Max loss for yourself but I think
the most II and you you can we both can
improve is the timing because I have
noticed that pretty much for all biotech
so when they push especially when they
Gap up and over 50 70 percent when they
push into the uh you know into the upper
range and start consolidate when they
consolidate you know pass you know the 1
pm 2 pm area that's where
um you know stock gets really tricky
sometimes it does a fake down or a fake
cow and it shakes you out left and right
left and right and you'll end up with a
big loss even though the stock didn't
even move at all I would prefer that you
know filter out of the trades if if you
know you're still in a trade passes 1 pm
you just you know cut it uh no stop
trading it I think that's the best and
most effective way to trade biotechs
especially when they form consolidations
like that and also in terms of tracking
statistics I'm seeing that uh technology
sector and biotech sector they have
completely different fading percentages
in in the same pattern so in the future
I would recommend for you guys to build
a separate spreadsheets for biotech
sectors alone to be able to you know get
the average statistics or how much you
can push how much you can fade on
intraday level typically biotechs are
not suitable to hold for a week
typically when you ever you're shooting
a technology stocks they can just fade
all the way down 75 from the top and
there's no Pedic about it but sometimes
biotechs can come all the way back slow
grind break the day high and you have no
idea how to trade that in the future
build your own separate statistics
sheets for biotechs and I think it's
going to be really helpful I think it's
personally helped me for in the last
couple months so I think it would be
helpful for you and that'll be into this

hello guys steven dux here welcome to
this video today we're going to
talk about some of the tickers that
happened this week
and i also experienced some of the very
strange actions from the market
so while i selected in total of four
takers and i'm going to talk about some
of the common factors that i shared
during this week so we will be able to
figure out a potential edge
or how to really react without taking
multiple losses
in a row so before i get into this video
make sure to click the like button
and subscribe and i will appreciate that
and let's get into the video
so out of those four takers i'm going to
point now some of the
easy factors for you to recognize
especially during the morning so you
will be able to
prevent all those mistakes from
happening especially in the first
30 minutes after market open um let's
look at
evk lizi and hgsh
ppsi all of those four tickers traded
over 10 million shares
in the pre-market and some of it traded
over 20 million shares in the pre-market
we talked about this volume estimation
before
that you are using the pre-market volume
times 10 to estimate the entire day
volume
and that's how you really predict and to
see if the stock is going to get crowded
or not
during the day for ppsi hgsh
all those stickers they traded over 10
million
and i think liz i traded over 20 million
so this one's the most crowded
let's start with the first one uvk this
is
after our gapper went from two to seven
it opened around
six and let's look at the entire
yearly chart we have resistance close to
120 million
around six but if we look at the
intruder chart
there's no consolidations it's just a
pure parabolic
resistance then infinite dump chart when
you can't find
a consolidation for it to risk off it's
going to be a little dangerous
especially you're shooting into a
massive resistance
in this case first taker i didn't get
shares to shore but if i
did the gestures to shore i think i
could take
a decent loss on this one because uh for
me 100 million resistance
is a solid amount of resistance if i
sure risking
the 6.7 and i will probably take a loss
once it breaks through the six thirty
dollar area
but after that i consolidated it traded
over 100 million throughout the day
then eventually broke it down one of the
thing that i noticed
is for these type of very crowded ticker
and after the morning squeeze they don't
usually drop the average percentage
that i expect them to so in this case
ebk dropped it only 50 percent but you
see
that normal gap up short drops over 75
or lower than that so when you were
looking at the chart
that the stock didn't really fade the
ideal point
that you expected it's a potential to
short into the next day
so for evk i was looking for a little
push and potentially get to
the low six or the mid six to short into
but turns out didn't really give me the
push
in the morning so i kind of just let
that one go
but usually when you see this type of
crowded ticker
this is the only one sample that i saw
out of hundreds of samples
that they produce the squeeze like that
so that was a really strange morning
spike
and how to really manage your risk i
would say
that if you're using the resistance if
you're really close to the resistance
as a risk to short into then i would
definitely risk where you entered so
that you can avoid
this type of loss or you can keep it to
the minimum so in the next sticker i'm
going to talk about li zi
this one traded over 20 million shares
in the pre-market
and i already noticed that in the
pre-market i
also showed it around 4.7
which i kind of broke my rule because i
tend to avoid
this type of very crowded ticker that
trades over 200 million shares
a day but if you look at another 100
million resistance very similar to
uh evk but it's more
crowded compared to that ticker so
you can see pretty much every single
ticker that trades over 20 million
shares or 10 million shares
they always produce some very
unpredictable squeeze
especially during the consolidation so
ebk
did a squeeze l-i-z-i did another
squeeze and slow grinded
forced people to bite the breakout and
dumped after the breakout so that was a
long trap as well
then hgsh this one also traded
tons of mile in the pre-market weird
squeeze after open
ppsi same thing very solid resistance
back in the days almost 300 million but
still he did multiple squeeze during the
day
so all of those four tickers the
conclusion will be that
when you are trying to shore into this
type of heavy resistance
if the stock gets really crowded always
wait until
after 10 30. i would recommend for that
especially that for the crowded tickers
it is not ideal to short
at open even though when you are very
close to the resistance
so the second factor that they commonly
share for those four tickers
is three out of four tickers they faded
in the afternoon only
four liz-i dumped and faded into the
next day
ppsi dumped well this one didn't produce
enough range so it dumped you lose
75 percent from the high but for l i z
i evk as i said majority of these type
of ganners
they drop 75 percent from the high so
let's
point it outwards the 75 percent is so
if you look at
uh the 75 reward will be
so this is the high drop 75 percent will
be anywhere
between 3.5 into this consolidation
same thing with uh li zi 75 percent if
we zoom out the chart
right about here this is how you really
figured out
if the stock has a potential opportunity
to shorten to into the next day
if they didn't fade to the maximum
reward so in this case evk lici
does have potentials into the next day
but hgsh
and ppsi doesn't so this is how you
figure out
if there is a decent amount of reward
into the next day and also when you are
looking at the chart action
you can see that there are some of the
factors they
share most of the time and also i should
give you a decent idea
where you should sizing in and at what
time there's sometimes you have to avoid
especially for the first
20 minutes to 30 minutes so that will be
all the details that i figured out in
this week
trying to adapt to the market personally
for me it's not a great week
i should definitely cut well majority of
those
opportunities but turns out i got two
rushed into the entry
and took some losses and made some small
gains
hopefully that i will be ready in the
next week so
no matter how many years we're in the
market you're always trying to adapt
so for you guys uh please don't forget
to check out the details on the stocks
and that will be end of this video thank
you very much for watching and i'll see
you guys in the next one

what's up guys given dr. welcome to the
new video lessons of the week and today
we're going to talk about some huge
market caps and how to exactly trade
them and what's the difference between
large cap and small cap in a more
detailed way and we're gonna also talk
about some volume analysis for some
tickers that people are really confused
about how to differentiate between bound
Shore and solid consolidating and
becomes not a bad show anymore so
alright let's get into my sweet time
Friday treat about 20 million shares and
you can see my seed never traded that
many shares for the past couple month
and when they trade them about how many
shares they always finish really weak
they finish red and as you can see now
in the morning when you see the spike
you can treat it as a potential puncture
but when they start consolidating for
hours and hours and for an entire day
that that stop becomes a bouncer it
becomes the stepper pattern and all the
separate patterns they can really easily
gap up and because they treat about 20
min ensured all those 1.2 open for area
can become a solid support then it's
really hard to shut it down
even though it has this 70 minute
resistance in you know $3 each area so
for me on Monday and Wesley it's a
potential long and stuff but I know
short and as long as they can get you
the three area I'm still a little bit
long bias because I'm gonna break that
1.3 1.4 area to go potential long
instead of potato short now it's my
opinion and why is V
CRO and now people are really confused
about how to build a swing short build a
swing sure it's really difficult because
you can take days and days to build a
decent position can take a month for
their start to drop and you can see the
entire area of the resistance in 12 and
I don't think it's going to get out
there anymore my expectations probably
on three back to a maybe can break this
support go back to $7 it just takes time
because all the time we're on a hype
it's gonna be it's gonna be a go away
anytime soon especially with the
fundamentals that are not really really
good
tl are why people I see people took a
decent loss on this one because they're
looking at sure this over an extended
gap down I'm bigger market caps all
those patterns that don't really work
that well because they have larger
market cap and it's a very similar to
crowded trades when the stuff looks like
it's crowded or just patterned don't
seem to work that often with an IO as
well but I'm bigger market you have
their resistance and their support works
a lot better than small caps on some
both have sometimes you can see they can
cross straight out of your support level
you're Rick stone then you don't even
have time to cut your losses because he
dropped so quick now I'm bigger market
cap especially on Friday and Thursday
you can see there's a clear support
around this nine dollar area and with
with this massive pullback of this large
market cap although support there always
hold that you can set in huge on those
type of pattern and you can make decent
twenty to thirty percent gain of this
area and also on this $13 resistance
zone you had this morning push throw it
back this 13 act as the resistance so
it's really hard to go through the
resistance because it's really a big
market cap so you fit all the way back
to ten and I'm looking for more fade
Monday probably goes back you eight
dollars iPhone 5 you trade a massive
amount of volume so there is a whole lot
of resistance everywhere I don't
expecting this one to go over 13 if it
bounces I will be shorting to bounce so
let's jump into conclusions with higher
market cap there
resistance and support tends to hold
really well on the current day but small
caps they don't sometimes they don't
hold that well unless they treat massive
amount of volume also huge market cap
they drop really really slow and they
were not really really slow so don't
treat it like day trading if you want to
swing these patterns you have to be
patient you have to be real position
several time in several days don't get
in to rush into one day I see people are
to rushing or getting to see ROA in that
tent in the 1980s and you went all the
way to 11 so break your positions in two
parts to size in to you I think that's
the best way to do it I think now will
be all for today and thanks for watching
the lessons I hope it's helpful and I
will see you guys next time

SOURCE VIDEO: How to avoid blowing up in recent runners ｜ Dux Analysis [G3USDdhIRko].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's for that student observe today's
video we're gonna talk about multi-day
runners that happened in the past week
there's so many runners up being
happening for the last couple weeks P&amp;G
obv VT VT P I am I'm so sorry I have to
put well I push back the statistics 101
for you guys since I get a lot of press
for that so we're gonna go over specific
patterns and specific how does the buyer
and seller think when the stock gets
into a critical point so the first thing
I want to talk about is SES this thing
went from almost one to thirty dollars
and the first day we're all the squeezed
it started which is at right around this
point so when you see when the stock
tends to crack multiple day lows and you
saw it right around ten million you
crack through this area but it didn't
really break and slowly grinding up and
crack the game so the stock already
shows you where the top is and when the
stock decides to break its top it's time
for you to copy or short we are shorting
especially SES on the first green day
and for the past couple months where as
so many tickers that didn't really break
through the day highs their own end up
on the first quinta actually all day so
a lot of short sales gets really
aggressive and start shooting SES since
it's the first play we haven't had for a
while when you see a boring market for a
while there's always short sellers
getting really hungry for shares too
short
when I guess you're sure they want to
use it we want to use it it gets super
aggressive because they haven't get a
play for a long time and especially on
SES this when the start decided to crack
the streak our area attempted and
squeezed back up to the day high up
around 358 around this point I really
wanted to go along but I didn't because
afternoon perk it tends to fail most
most of the time a lot of people burn on
congrats and if you were not on SS on
the first green day you can sail up into
the morning spike that will only really
hold up all the way to $26 so this is
only where you can trade it one of the
long patterns that really works is you
haven't seen your play for a long time
especially for about two months or three
months then there's one play popped up
everybody's has our eyes on to it
everybody has eyes on it and the stock
is trading 20 million 30 million shares
super crowded it because when the stock
tends to trade a lot of shares
it means it's taking out of the supply
means their stock has a really high
demand
if the stock has a really high demand
and really low supply the South tends to
spike also when there's Crowley short
sellers the spike tends to be even
harder so especially on SES went from 3
to almost 9 in the after-hour
now coming to the next day SES it faded
in the morning and hit the support after
or pre market support now just in case
if you guys think that after our pre
market support are the real support
level the answer is wrong is because
never try to use pre market after our
support so in this case stock shows you
where the support is and wait until the
stock 20 to break its own high first so
in this case the only long point you can
do is once I show you the depth then by
probably long into this consulting area
when Sutton's to break through around 10
a.m. and after that you can write it
through it for me I'm not a really a
long person so I just said it through
for the entire day into the next day
then when you see that there's really
low pretty market bond it means that
starts unlikely trade how many shares
which means decided likely to drop so
the star opened around 16 now when you
want to shore into this type of taker
you want to look for any type of
hardcore resistance in this case the
studied really consolidate for that long
since from starting from 1 p.m. to 3
p.m. that's the only consolation you
have and the closest consolidation you
have is $20 so I can't really sure at 16
because there is no any not any strand
no push
against our $20 if I show around 16 I'm
risking $20,000 per share with that
bigger risk range I can't really take
any positions so I assess I said alone I
focused on Pia in my sympathy play you
can see SES and BIA my the same sector
there are all energy sectors now be a
nice the different situations compared
SES because since SES ran for multiple
days PMI only round for one day and you
know be IMI is following the SES action
when you see SES is about to drop which
means be I am much going to follow and
also for BMI the risk management part it
will be so much better compared to SES
and women see there is a pre market
consolidation around $12 and the stock
special our SES start losing momentum
that it will show you that SS is likely
to lose momentum so when a stock goes
red especially on these type of multi
tier runners going in red for a ticker
it's pretty dirty for the stock so when
you start tempted to lose than $9 area
that's where issues IV into and cover
back into the sector area how's that
sound
it's your film so personally on the
library I showed it around $12 each
channel webinar and they're added into
in this breakdown so I covered five
tower area I made about fifty thousand
dollars so in this specific tickers I
waited for so many days just wait for
the back side I'm not really good at
long side especially on P I M is
training really thin volume so you never
know it's going to get squeezed your
numerator is going to lose its momentum
any type of volume because when the
stock is trading really low volume if
you took a look of the one-minute chart
its trading about 50k 100 K 20 200 K
that's concerning pretty low for the
stock running up 500%
so in this case I would highly suggest
avoid on the long side
I'm sure psy was pretty predictable so
that's for SES
BM b IMI so after SES and beyond i in
the stock and the stock market is not
down yet there's a lot of stock running
back and forth and we after that we
followed with the iv'e now this ticker
it did have some type of resistance
before right around October first but
it's really really same so in this case
you can only be able to trade as a gap
up short now in most cases if the market
is not that hot and when you start
losing seventy-five percent of its own
of its entire gang the stock has a
really low chance to come back all the
way from the bottom and to the day high
especially when they come back it's
likely an ad or potential short so bi ve
I didn't get shares too short but if I
could get shares - sure we'll probably
am around $9 area and covered by the end
of the day it's still dropping after
hours so that's could be considering as
50% again be NGO the sticker is
extremely weird weird so from the
statistic I'm tracking when a stock
tends to form its resistance in the in
the free market the chance of the stock
coming back to the pre market high is
really really low since the stock went
from 1 to 3 it's 40 cents to 3 then 3 to
1 then 1 to 5 so that's a huge
volatility back and forth so not really
recommended trading especially when the
stock keeps halting for 50 percent in
times of the day never try to trade when
the stock is in a massive hole for so
long so that's for B NGO now there's a
lot of tickers I haven't covered yet is
because that the stock didn't really
trade you enough volume and they don't
really meet any technical analysis so
when you are in really hot market I
would really suggest that to be
extremely careful on the long side on
the short side is because stock can't
drop from three to one and one to five
and each side move is up and down about
75 percent from the day high or moves
about 200 percent of from the day low so
if you cannot control your risk your can
will be easily blown up especially our
SES people lost a lot of money
the trend are trying to shore at the
front side and the side one found one to
26 and people are losing hundreds of
percent on our side if you win it for
SES backside you can short around 16 and
cover around 9 7 8 and we are being
patient you can't make about other 50%
75% in the hot market we are seeing
there is 10 20 tops and gainers on the
left side and each of them straining 10
million 20 million volume you know the
hot market is already here and for what
you need to do is you just need to wait
to wait for the right opportunity to
come is because if you are being too
rushed you will be the guy that sure the
SES at the front side and lose their
entire account so that's my analysis for
all the runners that happen for the last
week make sure to click the like button
for the video also leave a comment we
don't have any questions about any
technical analysis that I did for all
the runners and last be patient wait for
the right setup and don't get FOMO
because there's always opportunities
coming to the next day so that'd be the
end of this video thank you very much
and I will see you guys next time

alright what's up guys welcome to the
new video lessons of the weekend today
we've now talked about the entire week
what happened and some important tickers
are important the multi day runners
shooting to momentum breakdowns other
stickers were going to talk together so
let's start with tik tik is uh I believe
was we were split no it was it wasn't it
does have some resistance at five forty
years and into this push now the first I
saw his first push fails again push felt
again as I think at this point was dead
and it turns out I was squeezed again I
thought it's gonna get more volume by
turns I didn't failure through the
entire day I screwed up on this trade
but I could have done a lot better
shooting to this moment and breakdown by
it feels like chasing so I feel like the
chart is going to get chopped in the
midday and I don't risk that because
when I showed it here I'm risking my
daughter area so it's a little bit too
far from me and I didn't touch this one
and turns out thirty all day I even if I
surely in the four point five is
occurring reading
much profit from so STI K it's a micro
flow and we're treating my microphone
recently either their own birth splits
or either they're getting up in the
pre-market under all those morning spike
micro flow pre market gap they're really
dangerous because you don't know where
they can go especially when you don't
have enough resistance now for the next
month at will try to stay away from
micro flow morning spike with our
resistance because those are pretty
difficult to deal with AD IL this one
was a weird chart because now the
morning push to fit it back and try to
keep pushing through this faster area
but I couldn't so afraid it was done all
day and when it broke down and didn't
really panic that much it had its
selling pressure and random gap in the
midday and finally lost all its cans and
end of the day since this one doesn't
have any previous resistance I just
completely skipped through but if you
can recognize the momentum you can use
this fact our area or four point six is
a risk to shorting to now personally in
the mid day there's all of those weird
perks if you watch the ticker through
the entire day I figure it's not worth
it
I didn't touch this one at 10k to shore
one time and the cover for a 20 cent
loss so all the stickers if they're on
the front side don't try to trade into
the crowded trades because when the
volume is there and it's on the front
side there's no resistance you have
nothing to risk into and the charts
getting choppy it's really hard to know
where the sun's going to go sometimes
maybe alright guess the moment
but sometimes they are wrong then you
can lose a couple thousand ten thousand
fifty thousand really quick so don't try
to trade those on the very crowded from
side that's for ad IL now al QA this one
was little bit different because this
one morning GATT it pushed about a
hundred percent because this is not a
really gapped up Shore this is about pre
market breakout and I mention in my DVD
it was twenty to fifty percent gap and
accumulate volume and broke alikum
there's a potential break up by here in
the two point eighty you can take profit
in the five dollars now right around
here when this massive panic over this
fake breakout when you're tempted in the
mid day failed once it broke through
this momentum I shorted it and to profit
by the end of the day so this one I made
around fifty thousand his ticker I
didn't do a really good job really
control what should have been trading
because I'm trading all those micro flow
with our resistance reverse split with
our resistance even though you have they
have warrants and it will still affect
your decisions because on a fresh chart
even though with words don't try to rush
in because there's always volume can
push through the Warrens not the company
have the right to choose if they want to
sell or not so if they choose not to
sell you can get Briony squeezed that
you don't even know okay what's coming
out so their shares it's all directed by
the char so use the chart and figure out
where's the chart resistance how much
violence being cumulated
back or is there or there will be to
choose either you wanna go long or short
so don't really get judged by whirring
sound fresh chart that's a very
important thing now next thing is a s
and yes now people want to buy the
breakout another thing gets a multi-day
breakout and they bought it
we treat a multi-day breakout you're not
trade like it's a break on what's their
breakout because any action intraday
shouldn't really shake you out because
you are treating the multi-day breakout
now the stock is going parabolic in the
more deeper account that it's a really
really bad odds defying the parabolics
because in the key support level when
the stock breaks out he should hold
consistently for the entire day and you
should slow grind not parabolic because
when is parabolic script is going to
pull back and we pulls back will cause a
fake out cuz another chain reaction
people selling and this is exactly what
happened is and yes especially on Friday
that's why I didn't trade it because
when I start going parabot breaking
through the resistance it's a really
really difficult one to really buy or
dip by so I tend to stay away from these
I tracked all those more today breakout
on spreadsheets we're never going pair
but there's really really bad all too
fine on the breakout level so if you
don't track that
go ahead but my statistics it tells me
to stay away from those trades now the
next thing is obviously a gap down now
when people wants to use oversteering
gap down they tends to use the yesterday
close but some of Duberstein gap down
does have a different scenario because
if they don't have a consolidation
resistance or on the top of the it's a
four point four six and there's not much
voluntary
there if there's not much voluntary
there then there's not enough backwards
batterers and it's really easy to break
through this 4.4 if it has volume now on
this specific day since here doesn't
really have that much resistance so the
chart had a it's a random spike in in
the morning and actually squeezed a
bunch of people now treating all those
different types of virus being out down
make sure to choose the right one the
one does have consolidation resistance
now on this one you actually want
parabolic so don't rate that much volume
the force and this is what you get when
you are shooting everything gap down can
get to some random spike and can't
really shake you out so don't trade the
setup that's not perfect don't trade not
anything was up make sure to stick to
correct criteria don't trade micro flow
that has no resistance
make sure observe the chart not
accumulate enough volume to be able to
go along or cue me enough violent
breakdowns and all those break up items
backwards then bigger decisions for sure
always keep the risk reward ratio
correct and that's how you really can
gain a profit from I did make couple
mistakes I think I was up around 30,000
includes burrow fees and some small
losses that be the total weekly cap

[Music]
[Applause]
what's up guys doing dog Syria
welcome to this week's YouTube videos
and today I'm going to talk about our
last week performance and as long as
this week thing last week there was not
many trade think I made around 20,000
and Monday which is yesterday I made
around 43,000 and today I did not make a
single trade so I'm going to talk about
any and the ticker that I've made 43,000
years about the chicory oh okay yeah
sorry yeah now listen you have a lot of
reverse split tickers that they
basically kept out in the morning or
with a really really thin Flo micro flow
some of them end up with Tim or
sometimes with a couple hundred k flow
so on those things have to be really
careful because when the flow changes
the resistance changes as well because
let's say the verse reverse splits one
two a so you have to use the resistance
times to eight equal in central around
five dollars and when the stock spikes
victory is timed and close to that $5
you have to use the reverse rate ratio
to time the resistance and because of
the flow changes and different floor
rotations will affect the resistance so
that's a little bit more difficult to
play the long or the short today since
haer didn't have a lot of power
yesterday it's a lot of people feel like
they missed out shorting the hives and
stuff and today and here we have any
that one from two to six in one day a
lot of people shooting this into the
four into this crack and risking the
couple days with distance so I'm
microprobe it is really dangerous if the
flow start rotating start rotation
because it's not a bigger flow and if
there's a lot of demand or tiny supply
price will go up and people who are
shorting it when they saw the breaker
they freak out and especially on the
micro flow the ask is always super super
thing so it's really easy you have a
large one I share is to push to stop out
and when short-sword start penning to
cover all their shares to be short
servers a lot of shares at ten thousand
five thousand three thousand and they
actually push the stock away above the
breaker level and people who are late
have to panic again then the startup
squeezes to all the way ridiculously and
if you not quick calving losses you will
be down with a huge loss
so the reason why I didn't sure any is
now for my criteria of the strategy
called Bonjour Bonjour has to be the
sock over fifty percent now
I'm Michael especially on micro floor if
the stock is not even up fifty percent
it's not even worth it to short on
microphone because there's not enough
for risk award and you have to use that
to be able be able to apply into those
religion dangerous stocks because if you
are feeling of missing now and you will
fall into those traps every single time
the most crucial things on trading is to
help yourself be disciplined have a
really good habit never get controlled
by your emotion now I'm happy
any spiking and we have a Spiker what we
all know to their honor
throughout the wake in the holidays and
will probably bring up a lot of simple
stay plays on the low flow so we will
see tomorrow hopefully we'll have a
decent week try to live record trade any
I think we have a market close on
Thursday a market close early on Friday
so hopefully we can get a decent actions
in this holidays but just make sure when
the stock doesn't meet your criteria
don't touch it when the stock is a micro
flow always be really really careful
always pay attention to style while it's
going on and for sure but it doesn't
make equity I don't even try to touch it
and the volume so one of the things is
if the stock is trading a lot of bombing
is trading 10 times its flow rotations
getting really close to the resistance
volume which is from
I found history and it starts to get too
close I typically get out of the start
because when stock is crowded of you
always Lin's favor to the long side to
people who are buying now the reason why
you want to buy all those micro flow
starts because they're not the reason
they want to do a reverse spread this
number one they did too many offerings
and try to grease money stock goes below
one and they didn't fit the Nasdaq
requirements then they have dual reverse
way to get the stuff above one when the
stock is micro flow people tends to
manipulate it and trap the shorts make
the circle really high and dump it all
those retail sellers trading on those
things is very very difficult because
they're designed then to trap retail
buyers and sellers so always try to
focus on the protection try to be super
careful every single trade you make has
to have a maximum off it has to have a
decent risk reward especially under the
micro macro flow now you can see the
stock is going breaking down again push
it to 70 tomorrow hopefully kappa desync
about to ten or twelve maybe something
ridiculous and we'll probably see a dump
tomorrow because people want to get rid
of their shares in the holidays we'll
see tomorrow anyways guys happy holidays

yourself and we're also doing a special
Thanksgiving sell our tier 1 year

lots of gasoline that sir welcome to the
new week of the YouTube video lessons
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
and today I'm gonna talk about my weekly
performance and some of the training
habits that a lot of people are really
confused about something a little bit
I'm going to talk about a little bit of
details about Bound sure how to really
use the bombing prediction to be able to
avoid mistakes let's start with M V L n
so this ticker was trading yesterday a
lot of people are shorting me but the
way you can go long or short it's really
unpredictable in my opinion because
first Green Day she took a look at the
long-term chart there's no resistance
whatsoever so stocking actually
respected five six seven if you are not
really prepared from if you're not
really prepared for floor rotations and
it turns out a dump in the afternoon and
other people shooting me at 2:30 but for
me I used to show those kind of plays
but there are 50/50 so either it dumped
in the afternoon or they squeezed in at
the hour so it's really difficult
because we are trading all those bad
habits it will create more emotional
entries because once you fail and you
want to make your money back then you
start over trading they start making
more mistakes
so the more the more the most important
thing about trading is you want to try
to fail less so you want to make you
less emotional and make less mistakes
because yes there's profits I rather
miss it then give myself a bad habit so
for today yesterday violent becomes more
reliable for predicting today's move so
let's say a lot of people are stuck
going along the one ninety so you use
that level to be able to short in two
and it turns out he act really weird and
you chopped around through the whole day
one of the factor is about volume so if
the volume you start
increasing and start hitting really
close to the yesterday volume then
today's can really act as a squeeze or
get chopped around and not it will start
fighting a stock either they got
squeezed again and the stock goes up
ending the chase squeeze panic and it
chase again so all those small offices
will add up and end of the day you'll
realize you made so many small mistakes
and all those small mistakes as Abba
turns out to be a big loss so that's why
when I failed or will not fail too short
a stock and stock goes against me I hope
I will often announcement I often ask
myself where did I do wrong
and why is the talk why is the stock
behaving weird then I jump into a
conclusion so in this case the stocks
supposed to be under 1.8 area because
it's the most consulting when I was
shorting to you I turns out it broken
broke the one point lay so nothing about
this way because people aren't shorting
it and here is a pullback so lot of
people didn't get it out because they
didn't get out and when the stock falls
back they would like to cover to make it
even that's why that becomes choppy and
when it gets choppy and a lot of buyers
are less errors then it becomes crowded
once it gets crowded and it becomes
unpredictable so there's a series of
chain reaction involved in video and so
number one thing when bottom start
getting close to the yesterday volume
don't short it it's going to get choppy
and don't try to get don't over trade if
the stock did not behave what are you
expecting so don't try don't try it
twice if you've made a mistake move on
to the next there's always better play
in the future no need to get stuck in
one stocks you're going with odds and
you didn't go to your way you move on to
the next and just keep executing and we
made a mistakes
you had your risk level and take a small
ass I'm just ignore throughout the whole
day
I think that's a better way to avoid
overtraining because a lot of people
tends to get married on one ticket
another thing I wanna talk about is
parabolic short so one of the key
lessons about a run short is stock has
to meet about 50% on daily spike and if
there is no resistance there's going to
be difficult to predict actions and
since we don't have a lot of play in
this week a lot of people like to sure
something that it didn't debary made it
barely missed criteria and if the start
to not go their way they would like to
add so when you start gonna perform the
quarter you are wanted and you're so
desperately want money from the market
then the market is definitely a go to
opposite way that you're expecting don't
try to take her that didn't meet the
criteria you're expecting because
especially in November and December
we're going to get a lot of hype lot of
supernovas going on so once you trade
all those back with your pattern and you
will give you a very bad happen there is
going to be one day that stock just blow
through up your mind and you you're
gonna end up taking a huge loss well
don't trade something that didn't meet
your criteria perfectly especially in
November and December and once the stock
is having a lot more volume and compared
to yesterday resistance then don't trip
something like that as well because we
will start get patted madder than that I
think I did pretty good this week I
think I made talked about that 17,000 on
Tuesday last 2009 Wednesday didn't trade
on Thursday and lasts about 3000 today
because I last 3000m bln if here's me
two years ago I would just keep finding
us up because there's a lot of
resistance and we'll get chopped around
taking small losses here or there that's
what I used to do now I have learned
many mistakes and the bomb start is
choppy
avoid as much as possible for those
tickers and because they really can
screw you emotionally and giving a
really bad habit so that be the video
lessons for all and the market is coming
back a little bit it's better than last
week hopefully you guys had a great week

================================================

Kind: captions

you
[Music]
what's up guys team doctor welcome back
to another youtube series and today i'm
gonna talk about two important concepts
that i developed that for beginners -
how to really recognize and you know
what's the most useful patterns out
there
and other people with are inventing
patterns and some of their skin some of
an areal and as a beginner I know that
confusions of you know you don't know
which one is real which one is fake I
don't know we're trying to study because
you don't always times on a fake ones I
know something most don't
so today I'll give you two concepts that
could help you recognize those patterns
much easier to really figure it out know
which one can be profitable which one's
not so I'm gonna introduce the first one
it is changeable factor
so changeable factors are people who are
inventing factors that it's already out
there so what does that mean that means
like something like double top cup a
hand oh a lot of well-known pattern like
moving averages RSI those are very basic
standard knowledge that I have to know
I'm still getting to stock market you
know what it's market cap but in terms
of indicators that RSI moving average
VWAP then double top double Balan and
those type of indicators that everybody
knows we're trying to learn how to
really find the correct pattern to
charity if you put this concept into
ninety percent people lose one in stock
market ten percent people make money in
stock market you can kind of notice that
a lot of people trying to learn the same
thing which is all those indicators out
there that is in the books and
everybody's talking about because of
those indicators they're not very stable
there are changeable factors in it that
means if there's a lot of people using
it and it can turn to the opposite ways
the fundamental thing about stock market
is let's say we have 10 people then we
have this one trend going back and forth
it's a fresh chart and nobody has
touched it yet before and you now some
type of news and everybody is using the
same pattern so nine people are using
the same pattern and nine people are
doing the opposite now the results will
be that one person will Wayne pretty
much win all the money from all those
nine people and those time people will
likely to lose money if you put this
concept and correlating with what I just
talked about that everybody is trying to
learn the same thing same indicators to
be doubled ap moving averages and RSI so
the reason why all those indicators that
only work about 30 or 40 percent of the
time is because all those concept that
existed behind it which is nine people
lose money when people win money and
that's the fundamental of the stock
market if you're not trying to be
profitable you I think outside the box
now let's talk about how changeable
factors and now there's two things that
you cannot be changeable especially when
the stock already formed its own pattern
where it's already form its own history
that's why a lot of people talk about
history tends to repeat again and again
that somehow right and somehow around so
today I'm going to give you like how-to
recognize you know some history do
repeat some time - history doesn't
repeat let's go into from the very
basics so we are now offering warrants
and financing those are the three things
that can be you know really mess with
the technical analysis and when I start
decides to do offer an ad such that your
warrants stop instant drops about 70 to
75 percent of the time in one candle so
you can't really exit out of that
position and when you're going long into
stock you're pretty much going to lose
all your money
now that's a unchangeable factor it's
because think about like this way so if
there's only certain amount of shirts
for you to be able to trade that let's
say it's a simple supply demand question
let's say if you only have ten shirts to
trade and there's 10 people you trade
this stock and that can be you know
bouncing back normally because those 10
people are buying and selling
now suddenly in one day and the supply
instantly count 100 there's too many
shirts for 10 people to buy in that
specific day volume then supply demand
if supply goes up demand goes down or
stay the same
suddenly stocks drop smash agree that's
the very basic things about no supply
and demand now let's talk about opposite
things
so unchangeable factors can be also
applying to the opposite way now when
the star decides to do a reverse way
they will increase the stock price and
reduce its float now that's how small
caps tends to survive in the overall
market they are trying to reduce the
entire you know flow size which is how
measures are available for an investor
to trade or retail people to buy the
reduce about you know 20 times 50 times
an answer need 20 million shares
becoming two measures or like two
hundred caters when they reduce the flow
that means they're reducing the supply
now if that specific intraday is
generating a lot of volume that means
there's a lot of demand plus really low
supply that means the stock exactly to
go up that's why I smoke absence to go a
thousand two thousand three thousand
percent of the time now those are
unchangeable factors that means that if
stock decides to do that and you can't
really change the outcome but you can
take advantage of that outcome so
hopefully you guys understand all the
concept
that's a Bobby there's too many people
using the same strategy it tends to fail
if that's a changeable factor
unchangeable factories start decides to
do something that everybody can see it
that increase in the flow sides or
reducing the flow size let's say a
massive event already happened and
outcome is already there now you can
take advantage of the outcome that's
where note the patience comes in other
people are talking about you know you
need to have massive patience patience
always wins and you need to know how to
really use that patience to take
advantage of people already mass
spawning and tend to make better money
to use their psychology to benefit your
trading odds so let me give you example
so let's talk about history tends to
repeat again there's two unchangeable
factors that be that can exist out there
one it will be a warrant and offering
reverse split can reduce or increase its
full size so amount of supply can be
changed within a day now let's give you
a really good example about Bitcoin so
back in two years Bitcoin increased to
almost $20,000 at that time everybody's
talking about Bitcoin and how good
Bighorn is and suddenly a Bitcoin
drought from you know to twenty thousand
to four thousand or three thousand in
drop almost ninety percent of its own
again
now the reason after that is when you're
trying to guess how high Bitcoin can go
was you know pushing to that twenty
thousand you never know because you
don't know why we're having a future
now once the Bitcoin failed from that
20,000 and you formed a chart already
you becomes outcome the big coin went
parabolic so 20,000 it cans back down
wind up a little bit and consolidating a
fifteen thousand dollar area for like a
couple months then boom dropped it into
a ten thousand and it's six thousand
three thousand so this is one of the
unchangeable factor about the big points
so if Bitcoin tends to keep going flat
for two years and it tends to spike into
that $15,000 area again you won't know
there's a lot of people trying to sell
because they're popping corn at 15
and they have no idea by becoming works
and how Bitcoin works when the Bitcoin
tends to go back to the same level were
they bad they're likely to sell so that
is an unchangeable factor and also is a
human nature so those two concepts
should answer Alba Casas question what's
the difference between the market
conditions on no 2018-2019 and wide
overall market is changing you know a
lot of people are learning the same
fundamental thing that a lot of people
are trying to learn at the same time
it's all the indicators that are using
that doesn't really work because there's
too many people using it and you don't
really know the psychology behind it or
how it works
what's the human injury behind RSI
what's the human nature behind you know
double-top I will say 90% people don't
really know what's the psychology behind
it and also what's the human nature
behind moving averages as well if you
don't understand it do not learn that
type of indicator because it will not
work trying to find a pattern that also
involves human nature I think this type
of method works in every single market
doesn't really matters options futures
and Forex you need to find a pattern
that involves human nature involves
history now the third thing you need is
data which I always talk about so once
you find a pattern it's a beginner you
will be very easy for you to stay very
consistent profitable because you only
need to find one pattern and you just
trade that one pattern for a while in
the meantime you can research further
patterns as well so personally I tend to
look for that type of no three
conditions at the same time to find to
create new patterns to find new patterns
I know we will be a little bit confusing
I know at the counter and the concept
will be to be confusing I'll try to go
back at the beginning to the video and

hello guys demondux here welcome to this
youtube videos and today we're going to
many focus on how to find
a pattern to trade in 2021 so right here
i'm going to give you two categories
that is
worth for you to trade and to stay
consistent
as i talked about how to use swing trade
to be consistent and don't have to worry
about intraday trades
and also the very safe trades that you
can place on today as well
so the first point i want to recommend
to you guys to do will be
track the similar behaviors that you
want to track
and you want to track at least 150
samples to find
an average winning percentage for this
specific action
now you can't really call it a pattern
yet because a pattern
needs consistency in the last at least
two to three years to be profitable and
have
at least 15 percent reward from that
pattern
so due to the 2020 volatilities we do
have a lot of samples
and also a lot of outliers so personally
for me
according to my performance in 2020 i do
want to go into all those low floats and
to see
okay is it really worth it to place all
these trades on the low float
in the course of a year to see if i'm
actually profitable or not
because of the low flow that is
considered very dangerous to trade
stocks can move 20 in one candle that's
very dangerous for beginners to really
get hands on that
so for future recommendations if you
want to trade low floats
i would recommend that you will track
for the entire year
to see if you actually have a positive
net profit
of that specific pattern so going into
2021 i would category all of the
patterns in different spreadsheets
to see well for this specific pattern
it's performing very well for this
specific pattern
the only performance well seasonally so
some of the pattern what i noticed in
works in the early of the year but it
doesn't really work later of the year
because of that you can't really judge
your pattern actually has a consistency
or no
here will be the method of how you can
track all the patterns to see if you're
actually working details or not
so first of all what i will do is i will
separate low flow
mid float and higher float which will be
flow between 0 to 2 million 2 million to
10 million and 10 million or above
those are the three general sections
that we trade in this day training
industry
second thing i will do is i will
separate different patterns
under each different float to see okay
under what flow condition the stock
works the best or your pattern works the
best
and i will select the highest winning
percentage pattern
to put into a different spreadsheets for
me to keep my consistency
in the course of the year and the next
thing i will do
is i will separate all the patterns into
very detailed
factors because every single stock is
different you kind of have to categorize
them with similar cap
similar float and some interaction also
with
similar volume so after you build this
tree of statistics
and also to filter out what factors is
not very viable
for this pattern my patterns is very
crucial for its pattern as well
then you will be able to produce a very
profitable pattern based on on the
condition
of what flow you should choose what cap
you should choose
and under what factors to make the
pattern has the highest winning
percentage also
include with very high reward going into
2021 we do have a lot of volatility
we're going to get a lot of samples
so it's very easy for beginners to track
all these statistics
all together to find a very easy edge
back in 2016 2015 there's not enough
samples
you kind of have to go back into uh
two to three years before to find the
correct data
for you to be able to find a consistent
pattern
but for 2021 i think will be great for
traders
for you to gather your data and it's
much easier to find
a pattern for you to trade and also it's
much quicker for you to be profitable as
well
so that will be all of the
recommendations i want to give you guys
especially if you are just in the first
six months of trading
if you have any questions please leave a
comment below
thank you very much for watching and i
will see you guys in the next one

SOURCE VIDEO: How to find the correct entry on Micro-Float Stocks (Dux's Runner Analysis) [Nn6VL1BcJbc].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
a BLT both of castamere oxy today's
topic will be a BL and D F F n this is
probably the first low flow that's been
happening for the past two months today
we're gonna talk about how to really
traded and there's some of the details I
should be careful with now when you find
the spot that stock does have an edge or
sometimes it doesn't have an edge let's
get into it so APL super low flow as you
can see under 1 million and for any
floats under 1 million is considered to
be a micro flow or ember one they have a
really high volatility number two it's
really hard to get a very accurate entry
point because the spirit is typically
really high the range is pretty big and
we can see even from 5 to 20 at the
first day now most people think ok what
stock went over 100% when it's time to
shore now just for experience because I
track statistics on those micro flows I
try to figure out when is the time to
place the right Shore and when it's time
to cover typically for micro flow stock
likely to spike over a hundred percent
if a micro flows spikes only over a
hundred percent
barely over a hundred percent that's
constantly really low because average
micro flow if they tend to spike over
first day or second green day and the
first green day if they trades about
fifteen or twenty times of its pro
rotation typically goes over two hundred
three hundred percent but first he
actually traded about think goes around
two million shares so that spike in
percentage considered to be really low
for micro flow stocks now people are so
eager to really sizing those place
because for the last month we didn't
really have any place to really size
into so when people are so eager to make
a play they don't care about what
they're so eager to make money when that
kind of thoughts get into your head
you're likely to lose because you're
driven by emotion in this specific
situations people who shorted on May 1st
of course they got squeezed in the pre
market and who also bought a break as
well
and now on this day on the second Green
Day and now shortly on the second green
day is much better than actually in the
first Green Day so for microflora and
the first Green Day is an ever and for a
second birthday
maybe because now for second Green that
he needs to form its resistance on this
one entry in the morning it's a
completely gamble because you don't know
the sagas gonna spike higher and
typically on the second Green Day gap up
it's really hard for the statical red
since he gapped up eighty percent so for
a pil to go red he needs to draw over
fifty percent on the current day which
is really unlikely to do you can see
drop from 20 to 12 is still 20% up in
green so now that's why I didn't really
short on a gap up into a second Green
Day activity to a pristine gap down
because he need the statical read first
then push through the resistance then
surely into that for second winded gap
up I typically don't short into that and
I think was right at around 7:00 a.m. I
woke up and there were shirts too short
but no matter what you do there's no
edge if the stop break through the
resistance it's pretty much again but
assuring you that into into the second
Green Day now if the stock gaps down the
stocks only up over a hundred percent if
you use the $13 as resistance you're
into you might not really reach to
thirteen because the consolation area is
between nine to thirteen so you don't
know where to choose the resistance
shoring to and that is the risk for
shorting into micro flow since they have
a large range a risk area now the key
point is always find a consolidation
after the first screen day to shore into
a micro flow stocks because once it
consolidates you have a tighter range
especially on the second green day so
you don't have a resistance around
either 8 to 12 or 8 to 13 that you don't
really know if the resistance at a or 9
or 10 or 11 and that is the risk of
micro flow so hope this video helps if
you want to know more about trading
penny stocks click the link real the new
DVDs coming out soon
you will pretty much give you about how
to really trade in more specific
situations so let me know if it's
helpful I will see you guys next video

SOURCE VIDEO: How to find the right stock to trade？ (For Beginner + Advanced details) [oX-l919U0Vo].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys team that's here sorry uh
this YouTube video is gonna be a little
bit late compared to that way I
typically update every single week so
today we're gonna talk about how to
reduce game for stocks and I see a lot
of people asking well how does teacher
is really trying to find the ticker of
what is supposed to trade on the current
day today I'm gonna give you a cup of
tea Ria's take it and use it it's very
simple so issue help you narrow it down
which stock to trade and to also help
you not to trade that much alright so
the first thing is typically what I do
is that look at top person gainer on
your platform this couple platform I
command that there's a trade pearl there
is in fact a broker there's trade 0
platform there's all kinds of platform -
trader platform you can choose whatever
you want equity feed and all that once
you find that and you basically want to
select either Nasdaq or New York
exchange to find out what is the top is
% gainers and you cannot find anywhere
between around 20% more above sometimes
you can see there is the stocker up
around ten thousand percent twenty
thousand percent but no volume and you
can kind of instant realize that to
start get a reverse split we're gonna
get into a little bit later because
that's gonna be a little bit longer to
explain tell you what I scan for is any
the stock is under two hundred percent
or above twenty percent in that range
you wanna find a stock that fits your
pattern and and also meet your criteria
as well to be able to place a trade so
the first thing is pre market volume
super-important anywhere above a hundred
thousand because if the volume is too
low in the free market the stock gets
really saying and you don't really have
the idea how much volume is going to
trade right up to open most of the time
the stocks come to trading symbol under
phormium which is very very difficult to
execute trades second
so the flow flow is very important in
supply and demand we all know that all
over the supply the higher demand the
higher to supply the role the demand and
that will affect the stock price and if
there's too much demand and there is
only the member of supply the stock will
go up
if there's too much supply and demand
will go down that will decrease the
stock price so that's why I can see
sometimes low flow will increase
significantly compared to higher flow
there is a specific range of flow that I
typically don't trade is between zero to
two million
so if the flows are two million is very
easy to manipulate that's number one
number two it's most of the time when
there are low flow the price the
volatility jumps back and forth with
really big range compared to other
stocks that have a little bit bigger
flow and it's really hard to execute
trades and you find the your ideal entry
let's say you want to execute a 7.5 and
on those lower flow we can probably get
secured at 7.30 so that's 20 cents a
difference compared to what you want to
execute in a higher flow especially when
you're using market orders now I'm 3/8
the market cap we all know if the market
caps too big it's a it's a 1 billionth
our market cap it's not going to go over
a thousand percent because they need so
much money to really move the 1 billion
dollar market cap now if it the stock is
under let's say 100 million 200 million
then it has a chance to go up 100
percent because there is a possibility
that's that will bring monger meeting to
200 media into the market cap or on the
current day you don't really see that
often so most of the time the stock
jumps around 200 percent 10 percent is
anywhere between 0 to 100 million that's
where you consider into like a mid cap
or small cap zone you can't trade a
comfortable range is around I would say
0 to 200 million and anywhere above that
I don't really feel comfortable to trade
especially on parabolic now also there's
crowded trades as I talked about if the
trades gets super low volume and it's
not basically not really treatable but
there's another scenario that if the
stock trades too much volume and you
will get crowded one stock gets crowded
think about like this way so if there's
industry and there's so many people
trying to go and make money there's too
many people getting at the same time you
will increase the competition
and once you increase that competition
is really hard for you to make money so
if the stock is super crowded it's the
same idea it's very difficult to make
money so that's why when the stock is
super Katya tends to stay away
that will be the three criteria for
today and hopefully you find this
helpful take some notes and thank you
very much for watching this video and
I'll see you guys next week

hello guys steven doctor welcome to this
new youtube episode today we're going to
talk about
risk management and how to do this game
for the right stocks to trade
so before i start this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
and also i'm going to tell you a little
bit about myself
and how did i really start to develop a
method of finding the correct stock for
me
that's fitting my own strategy
so back in 2016 i was taught that pretty
much all stocks under 10
is called a penny stocks so every
morning anytime between eight to 9 30
i will scan for the stocks that is under
10 and
which is over 70 or 100 percent
i will find the stock list over 70 that
will look at the stock price
at that time i wasn't very careful with
the stock price itself
so i was sizing in about same amount of
shares in
stock around one dollar stocks around
two dollars or even seven dollars
i don't really realize that i'm sizing
in completely different size in
different stocks
what i usually learned about penny
stocks is
the lower the price is the more volatile
it is
and that's completely wrong because when
you are looking at
a five dollar stock sometimes and the
flow is around
let's say 300k or 500k the stocks can
jump
around 20 30 percent in one candle and
that can be have equal volatility or
more volatility compared to the stock is
around 50
cents it's all dependent on the flow and
how much demand for that stock
at that time so never look at stock
prices and try to decide how much
money you should size into it's all
based on the volume
and the flow so that's a number one
mistake i usually made
when i was a beginner now the second
mistake i usually made
is when i trade about five to seven
dollar stock if i'm losing around 40
cents 50 cents
and if i'm trading that type of stock
for a while you kind of have to
develop a i would say a habit and you
are so used to that 40 to 50 cents risk
in your head as soon as you go back and
trade that
one dollar two dollar stock or even
under one then that forty to fifty cents
can equal fifty percent of your risk
so for fifty cents on a five dollar
stock is about ten percent risk
but fifty cents for fifty cent stocks is
above 100 percent
so that's completely different they're
not aware of the stock prices can affect
their risk
a large amount so that will be the two
things you should be able to notice
when you're treating a stock and it's
really important for beginners
very easy mistakes to make so that will
be my
two i would say most important my own
beginner mistakes i don't know
if you guys are having some more
troubles with different risk management
so i will be covering risk management
for the next section of this video
but if you have any questions other than
risk management and you have trouble to
go through as a beginner make sure to
leave a comment below i will be
able to respond to you and find a
solution for you so
next part risk management it is also
very important for beginners as
well as i talked about 50 cents for five
dollar stock 50 cents for 50 cent stocks
is a completely different risk
management so after i
found that type of mistakes i tend to
try to shrink my criterias
so i will try to look for stocks around
three to ten because i don't really like
stocks under three
so i'm dealing with 50 cents on five
dollar stock
and 50 cents on three dollar stock it's
much easier to calculate
and when the trades come in really
really fast
i can still be able to follow the trade
and reading the level twos and
calculating my risk in my head
but if the trade comes really quick i'm
jumping from five dollar to 50 cents
and also delays my entry time so that
would be something that
i don't really like about and i stopped
trading stocks under three completely
for the last two to three years and it
actually increased my winning percentage
also my trade looks much cleaner i'm not
trading you know 100 000 shares and 300
000 shares
in in my trade because when the stock is
really
low priced and you have to trade a lot
of shares to make some type of profit
and some of the brokerage just charge
way too much borrow fees
all together so for beginners not really
recommended
i would like to stay anywhere between
you know
three dollars or above so that will be
my personal suggestions for
how to really scan in terms of price
range and let's talk about
how to really scan for upper bench
stocks after about one or two years when
you are looking at stocks
i tend to see that some of the stocks
can go over ten dollars
in one day so let's say we have a two
dollar ticker
and in the next morning he gapped over
to 15 so he was up
700 percent and as i said people don't
really trade
stocks above 10 because it doesn't
really consider as a pending stock no
more
a lot of people tend to avoid that but
those type of pattern
or ticker that's about 15 in one day
it's actually tradable if it creates its
own range
now what do i mean by that because the
stock went from two to fifteen dollar
it increased about 700 percent it
created range for you to shorten
to and if the initial cap is really low
which starts anywhere between 100
million market cap
or under and it's viable for you to
trade
and what's the thoughts behind why
if the market cap is under 100 million
and it's viable to trade if the stock
goes over than 10.
so think about like this way if the
stock is starting around two dollars
and the market cap is under 100 million
as we
normally see that pretty much all
company
lands in penny stock industry 99 of them
are garbage company which has a really
bad fundamentals pretty much all
volatility was created on that stocks
will eventually go to zero when you are
looking at in terms of
penny stocks you have to look at in
terms of initial market cap range
which that's not very much beginner tend
to look at
market cap range if it stays under 100
million no matter how far it spikes
to 20 to 30 dollars it is a still
garbage stocks
and you will still go back to zero and
this is one i said to my scanner from
two to fifty dollars
is to scan for stocks that have some
type of exceptions
that can go from two to twenty in one
day
and especially in pre-market so those
are a method i use to scan for stocks
there's a couple recommendations
let me just put them all together first
one will be
central voice stock starts under three
and
also tend to avoid stocks using otc
market
and if you are really good with your
executions and you're confident with it
you can do it but
for most of the beginners you can't
really catch the top
it's really difficult to get your
execution really good
so that would be something that i
personally experienced and also
if the initial market cap starts under
100 million
and it goes over 10 it is still
considered as a pending stock and still
lands in the print stock industry
including all that method that'll be all
my method for
my current scanners for now and i also
talked about all the concepts behind it
so if you have any opinions please leave
a comment below and thank you for

hello guys steven dux here since the
market is being really slow it's time to
follow up on your own statistics
tracking sheets
and today i will be introducing about
two different methods of how to really
track and use your own statistics
i've been getting a lot of questions
steven well i track a lot of statistics
but i don't really know how to use them
how to use them to benefit from my
actual trading
so today there will be two methods
before i start this video make sure to
click the like button and subscribe
it's going to really help our youtube
channel to give you now more
free content so hit that like button and
let's get started
first thing you want to do is you want
to get a solid winning percentage on
one pattern you need to average about
100 to 150 samples
to be able to support your theory second
thing you want to do
will be the frequency of the pattern you
want to track how many times happens per
year
so you can get an idea of okay this is
about a pattern that can happen
around 70 to 80 times per year the third
thing will be the reward
that fully depends on your own entry and
your own exit to get the average reward
each time when you trade it so the third
thing i want to talk about will be the
reward
now when you are entering into a stock
and exit into a stock each time
you will be able to generate the average
reward once you find that
then you will know okay so first friday
average reward will be 15
in the first half an hour or in the
first an hour then after 10 you will
slowly reduce its own reward
by tracking that you will be able to
find the right time to exit your stocks
and the right time to enter the stock
so be able to track the winning
percentage the frequency of the pattern
and the reward of the pattern you will
be able to generate a simulation of how
much money you can make
per year in that way when you are live
trading you won't be too nervous about
it because you have a massive database
to back you up
to give you more confidence when you're
actually placing a trade
so the second method i want to talk
about which is the main point on the
cover
is how to really separate a pattern into
multiple different sections
to be able to generate the better entry
and better winning percentage
and that's something is going to be a
little bit difficult to understand but
let me give you this concept first
so when you have a small account and you
want to grow your account
in this day trading industry when you
are looking at the market you want to
look at the market in different
perspective
so let's assume the average dollar can
be traded in a day of all day traders
add together
will be 500 million and let's also
assume the maximum dollar can be traded
of all day traders add together will be
1.5 billion so the average 500 million
the maximum 1.5 billion so to be able to
generate a high reward strategy you need
to focus on the market caps
that is under 100 million 500 million
dollars can make 100 million stocks
spike 500
but 500 million can only make 10 billion
dollar stocks back only 5
when you are tracking your own pattern
you want to split them into different
market cap sections
0 to 100 million will be one section 100
to 200 million will be in our section
200 to 300
will be another one and each pattern is
supposed to have about anywhere between
three to five sections or even more so
let me give you an example
overextend gap down is a very famous
pattern but when i track statistics
if the market cap exceeds 500 million
overextend the gap down pattern does not
work that well
that is very important for you to track
specific market cap zones
to be able to select okay so if the
market can exceed
at this point the pattern will not work
because the pattern is specifically
designed for back orders
amount of volumes being traded and how
much market cap there is
once you can filter out all of the
unnecessary criterias and you should
have a
much better winning percentage in terms
of trading this one pattern and the last
thing i want to talk about is level two
to be able to read
level two that takes a lot of market
experience it's something that's
hard to explain because when you're
looking at level twos different market
caps
offers different level twos let me give
example so
10 000 shares is a lot if the flow is
only one
million now 10 000 shares is nothing if
the flow is over
100 million so to be able to read in
different market cap zones that takes a
lot of
market experience for you to trade one
pattern
for at least 100 times then you should
be able to
have some type of idea of for one
million flow
50 000 shares is a lot then for 100
million flow
10 million shares in one order that's a
lot and that's something takes a lot of
screen time but
at the beginning level two doesn't
really matter when you know about level
two that can potentially
give you a better entry and exit and
level two will not affect the overall
picture
in terms of reward so just be patient
and
try to read level twos or record the
level twos to be able to review it each
time if you don't understand something
and that will be of the three things i
want to talk about today
and hopefully it's helpful and make sure
to leave a comment below if you have any
questions
and the market is fairly slow for now so
make sure to track your own statistics
remember the longer you trade the better
you are so that will be end of this
video thank you very much for watching

hello guys dux here welcome to these
videos and today's main topic will be
how to grow a small account in 2021
since there's a lot of stuff has been
changed in the last few years
there's higher volume casting there's
different resistance
and there's different sector for us to
trade too before i start this video make
sure to click the like button and
subscribe
let's get into the video so to grow a
small account what i consider
is anywhere between three thousand to
ten thousand dollars
and i do understand a lot of people
wants to have a decent method
because we have a small account it is
relatively challenging
to grow a three thousand dollar account
into thirty thousand
and potentially into a hundred thousand
but uh there is a way to do it
so i'm today i'm going to give you the
most efficient and most effective
way to grow three thousand dollar
account
exponentially to a higher amount so
overall
there is a three structures or three
discipline that i follow
so first one will be you need to find a
clear edge
which means that you have to find one
type of pattern
that can give you over 85 winning
percentage
for you to consistently grow your
account without
having a hiccup in the middle and you
can't really focus on too many patterns
at once because
you don't really have the equity to do
it so that would be
one of the mistakes that beginners tend
to make in their early stage of trading
career
the second discipline i follow is that
once you find the edge you have to
relatively increase your
trading size because when you only have
a 500
account or a thousand dollar account
it's really hard
to make a hundred dollar a trade or a
a trade because at the very beginning
you want to start make some money that's
relative to the account size let's say
that you have a three thousand dollar
account and you're only making twenty
dollars thirty dollar per trade that
will take you a very long time
to um be consistent profitable and get
used to the size
that you want to start making relatively
decent money
so uh you will need to have a decent
risk management of how much you want the
risk at
where you want to cover and to be really
good with your entry and exit and to
find
what's your average cover point what is
your average entry point
just in a broad area making 10 to 20
dollars per trade
is a decent practice to get the rhythm
of the market
but you will have to start going into a
bigger size to really
have a basic understanding of what's a
real risk management and how to really
manage your account size
by trading multiple times in a week so
the third discipline that i use
is you have to be consistently making
money without making many mistakes
but we're beginners will still have tons
of mistakes to make in the future
so uh i made this plan to protect me
from blowing up in the future that i
don't really
have a second chance to trade in this
market no more
so what i do is i will have a 3 000
account
i will grow it into six thousand and
nine thousand
i will have two three thousand dollar
backup account
if i tend to make a mistake in the
future and i blew up my first account i
will still have a second chance
for me to um still follow my path and
also to learn from my mistakes so i
won't make the mistakes again
a lot of beginners tend to put their
money in one basket
and that's where they tend to make our
biggest mistakes
and they will never have a second chance
to trade again
so those are the three discipline that i
follow up today i wish i know those
three disciplines earlier in my trading
career
but hopefully you guys can take this tip
as
you're trading otherwise and let's dive
into
a little bit more detail about risk
management
so um as i said that when you have a
smaller account you want to sizing
a little bit more than people that have
a 30 000
account or up to a million dollar
account there's two different
risk management for you to really
understand uh how to really manage
different account size
i understand a lot of you guys don't
have a bigger account in general
of a basic understanding that if you
have a smaller account
you want a sizing based on percentages
with a bigger account you want to sizing
in based on how much dollar you want to
put in
into this specific ticker so for example
when you have a three thousand dollar
account you want to size in fifteen
percent to twenty percent of your equity
into this specific trade now for me
i split my patterns into three different
sections
so section one will be the pattern that
has
over eighty percent winning percentage
which will be first red day bounce short
oversting gap down second section will
be pre-market breakout
panic dip buy and when i see
that a pattern has a 85 winning
percentage i tend to
sizing anywhere between 20 to 25
of my equity you can choose how much you
want to size a name based on the
pattern's winning percentage
which will give you a decent risk reward
ratio and
also um you can prevent big losses
because the lower winning percentage
pattern are not very consistent so you
can avoid
losses basically by sizing in smaller
now for bigger accounts when you have
anywhere between one million to two
million you want a thousand
uh 800 900 000 in one taker
that's where it gets a little bit tricky
because when you have a huge account
and in this small cap industries
that they can only accept 300k maybe
400k in one taker because there's only
limit amount of flow
only the amount of people are trading it
so there is a limit to
how much money you can make when the
flow is only three million to five
million and market cap is under 100
million
and that's where you have to be really
careful once you hit the cap you can
only season in
certain amount of money into one trade
so
that's one of the problems for bigger
accounts but for smaller accounts all
you have to care about
is how to manage your risk correctly and
don't have to worry about liquidity
issues and that's where
you can grow your account much faster
and
people have a bigger account in terms of
percentage gains
for all these disciplines let me repeat
myself again first one
will be you have to have a good winning
percentage pattern
doesn't have to be more than two if you
have one that's the best
that you have to keep consistently
tracking your statistics to find your
edge
second one once you have many patterns
you can build a risk management system
on different patterns
as i said that you can sizing much
bigger into a ticker that has 85 percent
winning percentage you can size in
smaller into a pattern that only have 60
winning percentage the last one is
that you have to protect yourself all
times and if you tend to make your
mistakes
it's okay many people make mistakes the
problem
is that you have to make sure you can
keep consistently trading this market to
gain experience
in the future so um make sure that you
have either
one or two backup accounts to support
your trading career
and that should be really helpful for
you to be consistent profitable in the
future
alright guys that will be end of this
video uh let me know if you have any
more questions
or any topics you want me to cover make
sure leave a comment
below and don't forget to drop that like

what's up guys welcome to the new video
lessons of the week so today I'm gonna
go over couple trades that I did I think
I made around think close to 60,000 to
70,000
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so today I'm gonna go over a couple
trades I did I think I made around think
close to 60,000 to 70,000 anywhere
between in I thinking around this week
plus Friday so um oh let's get into it
so I think let's see the way I posted I
lost 4,000 the October 4th made 26,000
October 5th made 10,000 October 8th I
think up to a nine that posted I think
was 5,000 then 2023 extra 23,000 October
10th and today I didn't try anything so
I think the key thing is do not try
anything you don't know because if you
are trading anything you don't know your
period again Pony wants your start
Gamboni you are getting to that once you
take a loss you will get into that how
to win back circle then you start all
over trading or what your needs
now of course anybody know it's the
wrong action to do when you are training
the stock will give you more losses
sometimes can pull up your account so
now let's get into the tickers we're
gonna talk about so VT VT and GTX I the
reason why we track trades is because we
want the average spiking percentage you
that we're shooting something without
resistance something like gap how short
typically they push about a little bit
between twenty to thirty one percent now
sometimes the function is a little bit
now there's a lot of more details coding
to evolving exhaustion's
and how to actually figure out people's
mentality now cap I'm sure is a little
bit difficult because sometimes can go
straight Buster risk and you have to be
really careful because you don't have
any resistance to your risk into only
intraday and that's something you have
to be a little bit more practicing and I
don't really suggest for beginners to
short into it once you get see this
pattern a lot start getting used to it
then go for
those gap up short now for loans people
asking me how to dip I dip buying is a
very tricky thing so correlation behind
all the mentality because large recaps
are harder to draw because they actually
have fundamental into it so once you see
a massive drop in this training massive
amount of value until they bounce back
so shorting into massive panic on a
large recap it's not very good now about
the dip buying big panic on a larger cap
then shorting into it now as I mentioned
in my training technique about the
fundamentals or the psychology behind
gap up short on short all those things
are a must learn because once you figure
it out majority people psychology you
can use the psychology to counter
different strategies sometimes it
doesn't work now there is always about
that 10 to 15% and the stock goes
irrational stock is not behaving when
expecting love then cut your losses
and once the stock comes back down then
he falls back to resistance then showed
it again because people thought was a
breakout turns out to be a failure
so on V T V DS stock had a master run in
the October 3rd and there's many many
Belfort comes back in 1 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 now
for all those highest people are looking
to get into the front side and
especially on sector have sex happens is
really dangerous to get into the found
side because now for for the psychology
of it once you survive this hype you
don't short into massive run-up and all
those plays found short comes in later
will be a lot more predictable than just
hammering the front side with maximum
volume because if volume comes in and
something like 50 million hundred
million shares every day the stock
becomes irrational it becomes very
crowded and it's really hard to predict
once it's hard to predict it's hard to
get our profit out of it so all you need
to do just wait and
till the start already form its own
resistance and you can use a resistance
to either shore or go along to play
different amount of strategies because
once you're shorting into something that
doesn't have a history then you don't
know what's going to happen because
history tends to repeat but history
tends to repeat a lot more times in a
South Market but if you don't have a
history what are you going to expect
because right you are trading just by
using intraday candlesticks just by
using trade or just by using intraday
level-2 all the stuff doesn't have
history can be easily manipulated a lot
of shares been trading people don't know
what they're doing and it's really hard
so ITC MBE v VT VT all those heavy
volume traded stocks just wait until all
those hype is over then either you can
swing for it either you can use the
bounce or whatever you want to do and
it's much more predictable than shorting
into the front side so GTX I that's all
day fader they actually get a massive
stopping that those three 30 years area
that the reason to track gap up short
they really track trades is to figure
out where is your entries supposed to be
sometimes cap up short does not push
they face straight back and you feel
like you're missed opportunity and you
want to chase into it all those things
that you shouldn't do because if the
stuff doesn't meet the perfect criteria
don't ever get into a stop because
that's where the mistake comes from if
you're showing something without or
without the support without resistance
it's gonna be even more dangerous so
training the market difference between
gamble and trading the market is you
have an edge in the market you have a 1%
you have in the market you know what
school you are you have to know what
you're expecting if the stock doesn't
behave or you're respecting then while
it's gonna be the results so you know
exactly what
to a plan in gamble we don't know what's
going to happen so this is the
difference between the market you need
an edge to be able to become consistent
profitable in this market because for
now mark has slowed down for a little
bit and all those three sectors already
died they formed around 100 million
resistance sometimes even 50 70 million
resistance so for now play off the
resistance is the safest thing to do now
let's get into tomorrow's play xai is
trading small on a volume and hopefully
can stay a little bit tomorrow now I
don't have a plan on this because it
doesn't really have a history so that's
for 8880 xi4 all those heavy won't
really ticker hopefully they can offer
some bounce into it and it's talked
about defying some of the tickers as I
mentioned the pipe strategy works better
than heavy volume with big market cap so
let's get into now right around here the
stock move from 6 to 14 now starts
trading 100 million volume on that day
once the stocks are panicking it's
really easy for sake hold still and
started breaking out again because
there's a larger caps as I said dip
buying into your larger cap has high
winning percentage also on the breakout
as well and since the stock is trading
over 100 million shares that's even more
profitable on something like an al so
next time you see the same thing panic
they always bounce really hard packed
always bounce really hard and especially
on larger caps over 1 billion dollar
market cap now once you start forming
resistance then it becomes a short and
since every day every bounce is failing
and start down training down trending
down trending so don't do buy into
something that has a history of a big
resistance but you can do buy something
straight
masamune volume doesn't have a history
staff has a larger cap than we used to
trade it is over 1 billion and all those
morning or midday parabolic panic they
are easier to hold and that's one of the
really highway 472 pipe higher that'll
be my thoughts for all the place that I
did this week hopefully you learn
something from this video lessons and I
will see you guys in the next video

wait I didn't recorder I just
recorded it's really what's up guys I'm
not sure so in today's video we're going
to go over some of the volume analysis
and some of the new method that I came
up with soon me and this method could
prevent you from taking a lot of
potential losses and also can help you
to figure out where the long and the
short sellers are and why are currently
thinking especially during the live
market and this method is based on the
current market conditions now different
years are very different I'm going to
give you a decent idea about the market
back in 2016 2017 and now 2020 I'm going
to mention that later on in the video
[Music]
so volume myth simply go over flow
rotations now I have mentioned flow
rotations many times back in the few
videos that I made basically is if the
stock is trading 30 million volume on
current day and the flow is 3 million
you are using the current day volume
divided by the flow so 30 million
divided by 3 the stock rotated about 10
times and I also talked about volume
predictions now one prediction is you
are using the first hour of volume and
by using certain formulas by tracking
enough statistics you should know how
much long is going to trade throughout
the entire day and you are estimating
volume divided by the flow then you
should know ok by the end of the day the
stock should rotate anywhere between
eight and ten times or eight to 12 times
you have that range in your head now
that should help you a lot especially we
are shooting our stock and we're going
along on stock you want to know there if
there's enough demand you want to know
ok if the stock is too crowded
I should stay away from the stock and
these things are the basic volume
analysis based on the flow and the third
method I want to talk about it's called
volume disruptions and I basically made
up a name for it if you want to call it
whatever you want to call it but let's
introduce how it works you can use this
especially during crowded stocks and
also you can use this volume analysis
and also if you want to make more profit
let's say you have a general big
account you want to maximum your profit
and you don't really know how because
skill in painting stocks are generally
really difficult is because when there's
not enough liquidities and you're
shooting a huge amount of shares and
basically you are playing with yourself
and that typically ends up a really bad
losses and also same thing if you're
going along for long way two measures
and you are not feeling the current
market conditions or the quality then
it's going to turn into a really bad
loss as well let's get into this method
and hopefully you guys can learn
something new so market conditions
now generally we're facing a back in
2017 to 2019 the general volume can be
anywhere between forty million to 100
million maximum can be topped out around
150 million to 120 million and that's
the general maximum volume we're seeing
in the last few years now average Vaughn
can be traded a day is anywhere between
20 million to 50 million and that's
where like comfort zones nowadays well
we're having 200 million shares a day
three hundred miniatures a day and
people are very confused I don't really
know how to really trade that type of
crowded stocks for beginners this is I
want to talk to you about when you are
just getting into this industries
especially when you're looking at a very
crowded stocks I understand you want to
be part of it but to be consistent
profitable you need to be patient to
wait until the start performing pounds
now this can be used in many different
scenarios for huge resistance bound
short and that method can slowly grow
your account and don't really worry
about the first green day by using this
method you can rationally tell yourself
today's trade is not ready for me also
to help you understand what's going on
the level two and what's going on in the
short sellers mind so this is the
example that I select it's Koji and yi
the flow is relatively high 13 million I
think is in between 10 to 13 million the
market cap is under 100 million you want
to look at the historical resistance how
much volume it got what were individual
resistance and where is the
system resistance for gnu specifically
you can't look within a year there's
about 70 million resistance at for
daughter you can see the stock one from
two to ten now since you know the
resistance is at four to five you want
to look at intraday chart when the stock
is trading close to around 11:00 a.m. is
slowly hitting that $4 to $5 resistance
zones so Jionni is already trading 80
million shares in the first two hours
and the total market ours is nine hours
and we have seven hours left so we know
in the back of our head that stock is
going to trade 200 million shares
because we're using the first two hours
to try to estimate the entirety volume
most we know it's going to trade
anywhere between two hundred million
shares to 500 million shares of the day
and we're looking back over that four to
five resistance zone and to think about
it if the stock is trading that much
volume it will definitely overwhelm the
resistance volume if the stock stream
way too much volume it's pretty much ten
or twenty times the volume compared to
the resistance you have to treat the
stock as a fresh chart so you have to
ignore the resistance in this case
people are don't really know how to
really use resistance they got
completely destroyed so when you're
looking at G and Yi the stock one
parabolic from 2.6 to almost selling
daughter and there's not big pullback
for short start to get out so we are
shorting a stock that is based on four
to five resistance you have to short
around 4.2 4.5 or 4.8 and the stock
didn't really give any pull backs you
kept parabolic on to seven in this case
the stock actually pulled back from
seven to five now when people don't
really have time where they don't have a
pullback to cover their shares they're
waiting for large pullback so they have
to take their losses around five because
it broke through the resistance of that
four to five dollar resistance then that
$45 become the ultimate support and also
to show
will become supported too because
they're covering their shares to
potentially get out for smaller loss
that's exactly why the stock held a $5
win almost to 10 when the stock hit 10
is trading almost 300 million shares to
400 million shares and this is where
bond disruption comes in that once you
know okay the Stockman parabolic the
short sir did not get out they want to
get out around 5:00 and they held the
support around five and shorter got
really nervous they covered their shares
and it's completely fresh chart the bond
is hitting the top of average Wang has
been traded in 2020 giving all those
conditions and criterias during the
night market you will be able to
analysis that okay what and the next day
the stock will unlikely to get 300 to
400 million shares in one day or above
that so the liquidity on next day is not
going to support today's liquidity or
breakouts for the stock to break out to
make a new high he needs to gain more
volume compared to the yesterday which
is already trading 300-400 million
volume now that's pretty much impossible
so that's well when the smart buyers buy
the stock and they no impact their head
heavy volume are unlikely to support
yesterday's equality this is why the
stock dumped from 10 to almost a 5 now
it's halted probably on t 12 and we
opened probably open around anywhere
between 1 or 2 dollars so in conclusions
there are several things that go into it
first of all we want to know what shorts
are thinking I also you want to know
okay is the bombing overwhelming the
resistance third you also wants to know
okay how much volume is trading is they
hitting the top average volume in one
day and just by knowing all those three
conditions will help you potentially
avoid a lot of losses and also that you
will know which support is going to hold
by using short sellers mindset that they
want to take a smaller losses that you
can use them as a support keeping figure
along strategies that will be able to
points on cover today thank you very
much for watching if you have me
questions please leave a comment below I
would love to answer it stay safe be
patient and don't rush into a trade make
sure to keep your risk reward under
control and now be the end of this video
thank you very much for watching and I
will see you guys in the next one

hello guys steven doctor welcome to this
new youtube video and i'm going to talk
about
some of the tickers that happened this
week or the week before
i noticed recently we've been getting
extreme volume especially
some takers can trade around 300 million
shares in a day some tickers can trade
even 400 million shares in a day as well
we're actually going back to the month
that was around march to
june pretty much all the tickers are
trading that type of volume range
so a lot of patterns are kind of
changing so i selected a few tickers
that stands out and also showed some of
the difference
compared to the pattern that we traded
one month or two months before so before
i start this video we have a conference
coming up
it's virtual conference you will be
hosted between
november 14th to november 16th if you
are a trader
and if you are interested in trading i
think will be a great opportunity for
you
guys to attend if you want to find where
to attend i will place a link below make
sure you click that that's where you can
register
for the conference and we'll be
including a lot of technical analysis
and data analysis
because we have been getting a tons of
data especially in 2020 lots of actions
so i think it will be worth it for you
to attend and learn
different perspective or different way
to think
and how to really become a better trader
so
let's get into the video today we're
going to talk about four tickers i will
place those four tickers into different
categories
so it will be much clearer for you guys
to see it and to be able to recognize
the pattern in the future
so let's start with su and w this one
will be shorting to resistance pattern
a g e p psi it will be i will say gap up
short slash
first green day shorty and the wwr will
be shorting into
multi-day runners and potential buying
multi-day breakouts
so let's start with s1w this will be
short into resistance pattern
and you can see that the resistance
there will be
total three levels so first level will
be 850 second level will be
553 to 5 which will be the longest
consolidation
and most ideal resistance you can risk
off the third level will be
the four dollar area for the most volume
that's been traded
in the three resistance first one will
be 850 second one will be
550 but the last one because the stock
is already being sold out
and it's drying volume and it's losing
liquidity
so that will not let in stock trading
that much volume especially during
the late of the day so ideal resistance
850 and 5 to 550. for september
24th we have a spike from 330 to five
in total expected about 50 to 70 percent
i think 70 is the maximum so for
shorting into resistance
i don't really recommend showing
anything that is below 70
is because in 2020 we have been getting
a lot of tickers that can push extremely
hard
in the open and normally their extension
will be much
stronger compared to the last couple
years so for my personal preferences
i rather choose something that is over
100 percent
than something that is below 70 percent
for shorting to resistance pattern
so in this case sunw i didn't really
place a trade on it because i was
expecting that more pushing percentage
can come after
open and the ticker expected from four
to five
and which i talked about the first two
layer of resistance will be five
to 550 and you can use that resistance
level to risk off
and personally i didn't really shorten
to it because i was looking for more
pushing percentage right at the open it
turns out it didn't really
give me the sufficient volume so didn't
really short into it because we are
looking at
in terms of risk reward the first
layer of support will be 3 20 to 340 so
you kind of have to cover
before the support area and
which will be around 360 to 370 area
when you are trying to get the maximum
reward from the pattern
you want to get the top which is 470
bottom will be 370. so in total
maximum about 15 percent to 20
reward normally you can't really top
take and balance take the stock
so in average about fifteen to ten
percent
reward which is not very good for a
decent pattern
so that will be all for su w let's go
ahead and talk about a ge and ppsi
hge and ppsi and there's more taker that
happened
last week and it's pretty much gap up
about 70 to 80 percent the massive push
so many people that trying to buy the
breakouts uh same thing with age
they both extended over 300 percent the
first few candles
two to four about 100 percent ppsi went
from
three to almost 10. when the stock does
produce
that much extension i do not recommend
to short into the morning spike now how
they already figured out
if the stock will extend that far when
you are looking at
the pre-market volume if the volume
exceed over 10 to 15 million or more
then that indicates a factor to tell you
that do not try to show in the first
30 minutes because most of the time that
stock is trading mass amount of volume
in pre-market you will generate 10 times
the four times more after market open
throughout the entire day and that type
of action especially when the stock is
going parabolic
you will be extremely hard to short into
parabolic
because they're just way too much volume
and you are likely to get
overwhelmed with the volume and you
can't really top take the stock
and also you're risking way too much you
don't know where to risk off because
there's no actual statistics
that can back you up with shorting into
morning spike
so the last sticker i want to talk about
will be wwr this
is i would say the most frequent pattern
that i talked about
a lot of people want to find a long
strategy
and i think this will be a decent
strategy to go along for
you can see the historical chart first
layer of resistance will be
450 second layer will be 930 to 950
so when the stock starts to spike and
break through
the 4 area i don't really recommend a
potential
shorting into resistance and also a
potential multi-day breakout because
there's too many conflict factors
first of all you have a breakout second
of all you have a massive resistance at
nine
and when the stock is turning about 60
million bonds with
40 million volume you don't really know
the stock is likely to break
the 850 to 950 dollar area so wwr will
be
not recommended for buying into
multi-day breakout as a pattern
so let's look at short intermodular
breakouts and
potentially find the top of the stock
and how to really recognize the
potential for spread day is coming
so let's go into the intraday chart
first of all we have a 18 as pre-market
resistance then we have a morning
pushing
into 14.5 ish so when you're
shorting at 14 risking 18 i think the
risk is way too wide
personally not recommended that then we
have
this really choppy action throughout the
day
and basically made the stock not
treatable multi-day runners
when we're looking to find the potential
first red day
we want to see the highest amount of
volume that can be traded in a day
normally will be
anywhere between 200 million to 400
million
then the stock didn't really give us
that type of volume
it was very choppy in two days and from
this
wide consolidations between 10 to 14. so
you can't really find
a potential risk you can risk off and
that is the most dangerous factor
you cannot risk off so the only way that
i can think of trading wwr will be
showing around
14 risking 18 which will be really small
positions because the risk is way too
wide
and i will probably cover into this
weird spike
around 10 11 to 12-ish so
making about maybe five percent return
and minus the borrower fee
pretty much zero and you can see the
stock is fading uh
two or three days after from my personal
perspective i think you should
completely skip
this type of ticker like wwr if you
can't really catch the top
or the risk is way too wide so that will
be
for wwr so for the last weeks we have
tons of tickers it was trading
hundreds and millions of volume but
there's no actual
pattern that was happening in those
takers
and a lot of people are feeling fomo
because the stock is going hundred
and five hundred percent personally this
is not a normal
market action and i don't think you
should chase into those strengths or
weaknesses
and be able to place a short position
right at the open
or chase a 200 rounder and you finally
become a consistent and profitable
trader
so first you will need a very tight risk
second you need the perfect risk-reward
ratio and also
last you need something to back you up
either
a solid statistics winning percentage or
something that you have been tracking
for a while and you see there is
repeatable results so that will be of
the analysis
for those two tickers and always keep
this in your mind
that the more volume is being traded in
one day the more competitive the stock
will be
the more competitive it is the harder
for you to make money
so that will be up to this video thank
you very much for watching i will see
you guys in the next one

all right guess we'll come to the new
video of the YouTube of this week and
today we're gonna talk about a lot of
runners that happen recently
so recently will have a bunch of week
sector that is hyping up CBD drinks and
a lot of violence been trading this
market and we have been seeing 100
minimum on daily basis so the way to
handle this because the starts getting
really crowded so I'm gonna give some
new tips and some traps and can spot
early on so before getting stuck in the
stock so let's get into it
um i GC and then BB o GN as well
PT IE so yesterday there's a lot of
people actually got on the water by
shorting ITC in the 11:58 and there's
incredible balance and almost took the
day high that basically squeezed all the
shorts and today probably cap down
tomorrow again first thing um
the stock is very strange a lot of
people lost money for me I made a
mistake this morning I think I'm not
shooting the 950 covering at 10:20 and
fortune took a small loss but I did not
get into those crowded trades I don't
try to guess the front side and if you
are trying to get the front side and
this is one of the stock italic my pure
your instant same thing with MBV this
ticker is a really messy and choppy
really didn't track my 650 area support
bounced up again Alison couple days you
might took that they hide because of the
price is kind of neutralized in this
seven or eight area just be really
careful surely not into this things
because they do have a lot of support
where formed and on the fundamentals
they're all bad but in this hype is
supposed to be a little bit different so
just be extra patient wait until the
stock firms in sanam re resistant then
shorting Durham for swing positions but
all those receptor are
potential top potential short-swing OGN
same thing he came all the way back with
that panic and took that day high and
the cap down 40% so there's a lot of
short traps and non traps back and forth
back and forth you can really get easy
to get trapped on the both side so
getting trapped on both side if you're
over trading and that's one of the thing
you have to be avoid so for me I will be
eyeballing the oldest place for a while
especially on this week wait until the
start actually form resistance then I
use really tight risks with I use really
tight risk to minimize my loss and that
should give me that should keep me safe
from its market the market has a lot of
volatility yes you can make a lot of
money but also you can lose a lot of
money if you don't know how to control
risk you can turn small losses into big
loss you can turn smoking into big gains
but just be careful with your risk
management those risk management are the
key factor for you to be consistent and
profitable in this market especially in
this I mean this week a lot of people
lost their accounts a lot of people do
know what they're doing and something
they're done 30 40 percent on what
they're doing so PT ie
potential I will say short tomorrow but
this one doesn't have return Saarinen
resistance or consortium area for me to
risk - so if it gaps on tomorrow maybe
become a bursting gap down for VT VT I
will say another up extinct gapped and
today I would say push into major
consulting area then fade so key factor
is avoiding traps by looking at the
bombing of the ones over trading 10 100
million just completely avoid it on the
front side sit out wait until the stock
forms resistance then going and for it
to go along just make sure your risk you
have very specific risk to set
and once the start panic you will have
your risk and you are not holding
through your risk and not cutting your
losses cutting losses is really
important and make sure don't go into
the really crowded front side and that
will be the key of the lesson if I don't
know about how I analyze all those
stickers I will put in below that bit
for today thank you very much and I will
see you guys next week

SOURCE VIDEO: How to start SHORT selling Penny Stocks. (What you NEED to know as a beginner) [ibQgW6L5w2s].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys Stephen Knox here today
we're gonna talk about short settings a
lot of people are asking me well if
you're a beginner how to start short
sell at the beginning of my career as I
get into the stock market or as long and
it's short there's two ways to do the
market going on the maximum can lose is
a hundred percent so if you bought a
stop in South close to zero then you
know twenty percent the first short sale
is completely different
let's say short at one dollar and stuff
went to a hundred and you're instantly
down ten thousand percent of your
original position there is a potential
risk that you might blow up your entire
account or you may be Oh brokerage money
lot of people probably heard about you
will blubber entire account if we get
scared about it but as a beginner if you
wanted to learn short sale you have to
focus on risk management as priority
especially in pinyin and orphan in stock
market now the second thing we're gonna
talk about short selling simply you have
to focus on risk reward either is 1 to 2
or 1 2 3 baby your risk in 30 cents to
make a tower you're making 40 cents to
make 1.2 powder if you're going on
investments also important as well but
I'm short sell you cannot let your
losses to infinitely wrong because
eventually it has more risk and long
that's why I live you are scared of
short selling but if you have to correct
mismanagement I think there's more edge
in short sell you my personal opinion in
short sale than going on because I've
tracked multiple patterns
long also works short also works but I
think short works better for me I think
has a little bit more edge there's more
things to be careful about impending end
there is going to be a lot of hypes 2016
was we 2017 was Bitcoin 2018 was Bitcoin
and 2019 was another biotech all those
things are ran by low flows they have a
really low supply and the demand is
really high so when there is overwhelm
of demand o problem to supply then the
price range will jump significantly in
short amount of time and that's how low
flow works and low flow is very
dangerous for short sell a lot of people
trying to make that big money on short
sell into micro floats and that if you
don't have enough experience
if you don't have good risk of an engine
it's really really easy to prepare yeah
if you started short-selling never try
to shorten to a micro flow unless at
least you watch 50 examples and that
already happened and you can try to find
some color pattern in there but most of
the time there's first quizzes like
Arcadia VP th and D ro is those tickers
if you screw up once and you let the
boss is wrong then you go through your
entire career the merit now in short you
need to figure out the psychology behind
long and short because you need to
manipulate the other side to be able to
get your risk reward for example so
let's say the Styles been consolidated
into our area and once the two dollar
cracks most of the long will panic and
you can really short into that crack and
you expecting more panic that's one of
the psychology now you can learn from
the loans and going short you can also
see ok well short sizing this area as I
maybe know the risk level of the shorts
if that level specifically broke the
engines start going on then shorts
cruiser will come so learning null and
short make sure learn the psychology of
both sides you will give you a
significant advantage trading the market
here's some brokers that recommend for
short settings so copra trade 0 center
point sure sugar sometimes has borrows
as well and speed traders different
brokers have different advantage so go
ahead and do your research different
broker they have different fees as well
so make sure we show in fits with the
best so the Ducks Turner DVD will be
ending the pretty sell in the next month
so mixture grabber opportunities and
that will be the video of today and I
will see you guys next week

hello guys david next here welcome to
this youtube videos and today we're
going to
talk about how to collect the right
market data you can
use it to gain high winning percentage
in your pattern and have a decent
understanding
in the general market and in different
market cap zones
as i talked about in the previous couple
videos there's one concept
that i talked about many times is the
higher the market cap
the more difficult for the stock to
create more range
in that specific day so for example
let's say that we have a 100 million
market cap
you want it to go up 100 you only have
to input
another 100 million into the ticker for
it to go up 100
right but if you have 1 billion then the
stock requires one billion
to be input into the stock for it to
spec
100 but that's much more money compared
to
uh 100 million so uh the higher it goes
it requires more money and more money
that's one of the main reasons
higher market cap tends to gain smaller
percentages compared to
a market cap that's under 500 million so
there's many ways to collect market data
today i'm going to give you the most
efficient way and the way that i
personally use for myself
so first of all you have to track market
cap
flow stock price by itself and how much
is up by the end of the day
and also what's the maximum gaining
percentage
during that specific day so once you
have those five terms tracked up
you will need to spread them into three
different sections
so first section will be that the market
cap is under
100 million second section will be 100
million to 500 medium uh the last
section will be 500 million to one
billion
there's a fourth section but normally i
don't use at all
is a market cap over one billion so same
thing goes into the flow
zero to one is considered to be a nano
flow 1 million
to 3 million is considered to be a very
low flow 3 million to 5 million
is low flow and 5 to 10 is a decent flow
and 10 million or above
it's a bigger flow in terms of flow you
have much more sections
compared to market caps but once you
combine them together
then you will have a decent
understanding of within each
condition that if the market cap is
under 100 million
the flow is between zero to one you know
what's the maximum spiking percentage
can happen in one day so once you've
tracked enough
you have 100 samples to 150 samples then
if you see a stock
that lends into the market cap between
100 million to 500 million
the flow is 10 million to 20 million you
will have a general idea
that in this specific day according to
how much volume is trading the
pre-market
you will be able to predict how much you
can spike in terms of
gaining percentage in a day so for
example we have btx here we have a
flow uh around 20 to 40 million then we
have a market cap under 1 billion
and you can see that expect over 60 so
once you track the data for this
specific taker
and you want to filter out in this
specific zone
that the market cap and float is in this
specific condition
what's the maximum specking percentage
can happen
in this flow and market cap zones now
for btx
i will be instantly know that today if
it decides to guess volume the maximum
gaining percentage will be
100 to 200 percent right now for gme
this is completely different market cap
and flow uh the photo is around 40
million
he did a couple offerings so it's around
70 million now and there is much higher
market cap
almost 10 times higher than btx in this
way
the spiking percentage will be much
lower compared to a bt
x in average once i attract enough
samples i will know that gme average
spiking percentage will
land anywhere between 20 to 40 percent
and by tracking the correct market data
you will be able to understand that
how much you can spike how much you can
drop and also you can use that to
benefit your risk management method
to be able to have a very good risk
controls especially when you are taking
and level 2 entry
so in conclusion how to really track
market data most important part you have
to track market cap
flow and how much volume is currently be
trading
how much percentage you gain by the end
of the day and
what's the highest percentage can spec
during that day
so once you have those five components
and make sure
separate them into multiple different
sections
let's say flow between zero to one and
market cap between zero to one hundred
can be section one
then flow between three to five million
and
market cap is around zero to 100 million
can be section two
so there's going to be a lot of sections
but once you get enough work
uh you will be able to have a great
understanding of how to really
measure the percentages and also to know
how much you can drop
for this specific market cap and flow so
one thing that can be useful
is to find a credit source that normally
std is not very accurate
so for example let's say we want to look
at the flow for vxrt you can see that
the flow is
around 108 million um archicad is
739 but normally i will use a different
source to compare if the flow
and market cap is actually accurate i
would use the apple finance
and film list to compare if they are the
same number
i fear not i will go into sse to check
20f
or 10q to see if they're actually filed
any offerings and to actually state
what's the flow for this specific ticker
by the way we have our platform
starcraft coming up
i should be coming out waiting uh two
months
and we are providing much more
accurate market cap and flow and also
you can build your own strategy
in the platform so you will be able to
generate your equity
curve based on your own strategy that
you created so
overall that'll be the end of this video
thank you very much for watching
i will put a link below if you want to
register for
the upcoming platform and other than
that i will see you guys in the next

if there's two days are around about
same volume then it's really difficult
to break that I don't know how this I
don't know how to explain this
that's what I've seen Dexter so Tristan
I've been getting another question from
beginners if I have a 500 dollar camel
or thousand dollar account and that
couldn't really apply for a margin and
County B up to short how do I really
trade one specific patterns to slowly
grow my account so today I'm going to
list couple criterias and conditions
that could help you avoid getting picked
out and be able to get the massive risk
reward so let's get into the lessons
so recently we do have a really hot
month and overall we did have a couple
moody breakout and couple failure as
well a lot of people are really confused
about well in what type of condition
should I really try to buy the break now
buying the breakout is without any type
of analysis arm flow market caps and
news
so those three conditions should give
you a decent idea if the stock is
bullish or bearish you're on current day
let me give you example so a I am first
I'm going to look at multi day breakout
first the thing I'm going to look at
will be the flow and market caps the
bigger the flow the more supplier of B
and if there's not that high demand the
stock won't really move that much second
I'm going to look at will be market caps
now the bigger market cap is the hard
for it to move as well as I introduced
the concept couple videos before if you
have a hundred million dollars and you
can make a hundred million dollar stock
move up a hundred percent but you can't
really make a 1 billion dollar market
cap starts to move a hundred percent
unless you have a 1 billion dollar cash
in hand so those two conditions are the
priority I'm going to look at before I
even consider to really trade on the
chart now thirdly you want to look at
the price condition so in penny stock
areas the more expensive the stock is
the harder for you to try to break down
now many people have that much money in
to really buy really expensive stocks
especially when the stock is around 10
20 and 30 dollars per share I don't like
AI n it's around $1 per share a lot of
people love to trade this episode first
it's cheap secondly they can buy a lot
of shares third if it really tends to
spike you can get a lot of risk award
and they have a good upside potential
once you finish looking at the flow
and market caps you want to take a look
at your recharge now whatever resistant
does they have it doesn't have a heavy
resistance is they that consistent down
train charts and all those are plays
into the factor of this type of multi
taper account now first of all when the
charts
consistent in downtrend dean for a while
for a couple years
the first green day is extremely bullish
once gets high amount of volume this is
considered as a first green day trade
about almost 14 million shares so
typically when you're trying to
anticipate the first screen day you can
go long because there's you know there
is going to be a high demand and the
flow is tiny you can get a decent
whisker from it but when you're trying
to long overnight well first you are
trying to Rick's that potential
overnight offering secondly you are
trying to risk of tomorrow is going
definitely going to trade more Vaughn
compared to the previous day now
40-million violence consider a decent
amount of volume there is about only
twenty to thirty percent chance that
will train more bond in the next day a
comparative for a miniature trader now I
am today when I look at the volume if
the volume is extremely high over fifty
million 60 million then tomorrow's
unlikely to trade more than 50 million
or 60 million because for a start to go
up in the next day needs to trade more
volume compared to the previous stay so
if there's only about twenty to thirty
percent chance that we'll get more
volume compared to today then we'll
definitely not try the whole overnight
because even if the stock is factory to
trade more volume tomorrow and there's
still a potential offering on pending
stocks and these type of offering are
dirty on pending stocks if you are
trying to hold overnight you can drop
about sixty seventy percent in one day
so in conclusion about this taker
overall first of all you want to look at
the markup and float secondly you want
to look at the long-term chart if it's
consistent down trending and the first
day getting a decent amount of volume
it's extremely bullish it's our likely
to drop now secondly we are trying to
look at a multi-day breakout into a
different type of chart something like
this right when you are seeing the
charge truly mass amount of volume in
the last couple days and the first day
trying to break out of this tip right
around 360 dollar area in this case you
want to go into the intraday chart like
what is going on in to all those volume
traded on
that specific day go back to the
boundary charts you can see not every
time when you're trying to break this $4
area 350 H trying to break out a gap
down trying to break out
gap down again trying to break out gap
down the more try to test a more
backward able form and it's harder to
really for the start to try to break out
of that area now as you see every single
afternoon there was a huge spike but
every single morning after that
afternoon it gaps down so when you're
trying to trade on this specific day and
you see there's a potential afternoon
break how it broke every single
resistance and the chart behavior
already told you three times do not hold
overnight because there will be a
potential gap down at the market open he
did gap down Charlie behavior is really
important factor for you to try to look
at the long-term chart trying to make a
judgment call from all those following I
traded that for the previous couple
month a I am and sealed DX star a
completely different mo today runners
and they're completely different booty
day breakouts this case studying
charting behavior were trying to prevent
you from getting effect out I'm trying
to help you not taking that indicative
twenty percent gap down to the next day
so nasty let's look at an NBC the
sticker has been running for the last I
will say overall a month it's running
around Corona bars a base down study
indexing and this ticker they announced
the multiple vaccine news for the last
couple years and tried to help up the
stock and in order to do all potential
offering in this case he did offering
once overall the hype is still really
strong and the multi-day breakout really
happened from very round very round here
so he did an offering and the stock
slowly comes back and start breaking
into this resistance now first of all we
are looking at witchetty runners first
one will be market cap and flow it does
meet the criteria it's a decent flow and
relatively small market caps when you
look at into the breakout the break a
bond has to be much higher compared to
the previous day take a look at this
volume trader the first day traded about
10 million second Detroit about 30
so this day volume is larger than the
previous day
now on the third day trading about the
same amount of volume compared to the
previous state this case it tells you
that well stock is trying to get more
volume but really couldn't break the
previous day so potential gap down would
actually happen on the fourth day so we
are turning into multi day runners
always take a look at the volumes
together and what day by day because if
there's two days are around about same
volume then it's really difficult to
break the I don't know how this I don't
know how to explain this so by looking
at this type of motor owners on VC first
green day traded about four million
second five million I did a potential
offering so that doesn't count and you
can see the violence getting more and
more compared to previous day and in
this state it should it barely amount
the same type of volume On January 24th
so it's unlikely to trade more volume
than 30 million because on this day
didn't really break the previous day
volume and the stock already tells you
that I started to show witnesses so in
this case if I'm trying to go short I
don't really want to sure into a massive
amount of volume day I want to try to
shore on the day after that has less
amount of volume but also as a long
trader you don't want to really hold
overnight if the stock is reaching
maximum volume if it starts to losing
volume compared to the previous day then
that's where he tells you you should
start exit the stock because the stock
is already reaching the maximum
potential and so overall all those three
tickers they have a different types of
multi-day breakout IIM was a consistent
in downtrend chart and holding around
that one daughter it's pretty much the
really ideal multi-day breakout compared
to Co Dax and BC and BC is relatively
expensive Co Dax has too many Faycal for
the past couple month and for me to be
selective and what I want to trade I
will be selecting I am not really
considering fundamentals
just by looking at the chart I am is
probably the most ideal tray that you
can make as a long trader so that's
pretty much it that's all over all the
three conclusions for multi-day breakout
as a beginner don't always rush into the
breakouts because if you buy and hope
and don't really
other conditions you were likely to
perform a fake hell and you will likely
to do it's more money because that's
where noobs trying to battle break out
and they feel more emotional because
they did a fake out and everybody tried
to sell at the same time you don't want
to be that type of person I don't want
to be that type of people making the
same mistakes always zoom out for the
bigger picture that'll be it for this
video thank you very much I will see you
guys in the next one

what Sebastian Dexter welcome to the
YouTube video lessons and this week with
a lot of crowded trades some thinking
doing a recap all the Carla trades AEL
QA and ADL now I'm gonna talk about the
difference between the resistance area
and it's getting into it al QA if you
took a look to mountain to resistance we
had some resistance in the 5 and look at
the recent volume it's pretty heavy it's
40 million mines 10 million and if you
took a look at ad IL the resistance are
not that much and if the volume is
trading over in the resistance volume it
is really difficult for the stock to
break down and down yesterday ad IL
let's put a line right here the breakout
level is right around $3 area and test
is $3 for multiple times and finally and
had a short squeeze you know like day
and second a gap down by entering gap
through the 3 so when the stock gaps
down it's really hard to overstate in
gap down pattern because if you sure
that for your cover point and all that
error becomes a support so you don't
know where it's gonna end you might end
in 2.3 meant in 2.5 the only percentage
canmake's about 10 percent or maybe 15
percent maximum and that requires the
perfect entry and exit so it's really
hard for already squeezed stock that to
come back down if they get down into the
major consolidation level
so using overstating gap during this
situation it's not very ideal and today
that's why I couldn't touch it now next
time you see these kind of situations I
wouldn't suggest to short it
because you would take days to break
this to read our support now sometimes
we can squeeze over the folder area then
we have another supernova or motive
owner
witchetty runner again now a olq way
today consolidated in the $3.00 area so
nobody knows you will actually break
this through our area
now eventually after impact down and
here it becomes me to resist the level
so in the next week hopefully this one
can bounce but the range is not that
much 3.26 262 $3.00 that's 40 cents even
though they come back to 260 you still
only came back 40 cents that's like
about 20% and I acquired requires
perfect entry and exit
so wouldn't suggest shorting that as
well and crowded trades means that if
the volume trading intraday is created
over 30 million volume in considered to
be really crowded since we're hitting
into hard decisions a lot of people
wants to make a bunch of money and go
spending time with their family on
Christmas so we'll have a lot of
irrational trades and motive relations
crowded trades when you see the violence
going to trade 30 million shares per day
then just forget forget about it don't
even touch this ticker wait under the
ticker shows the witness then or wait
until the ticker shows the victims into
the next day then go for it
because all those carla trades is really
difficult and all those short squeezes
you can't really exit this one from 3 to
360 in one candle and that's 60 cents
you don't really have a ask to cover
your share so you're instantly down 20
plus percent and that's really not good
to short into correct trades and you
can't really buy into breakouts because
when bought into the spiracles and in
turn you just say you got it here and
you couldn't really make that much here
the only thing you probably make you
scalp and the stock comes back down
testing 3 looks like it's gonna fade
back down but it didn't and it's really
difficult to long it's really difficult
to short so Crowley trades
wouldn't be suggesting
into the next coming weeks still away
from all the straights as much as
possible and a oqa
the same thing if the volume is there
and if the volume is too much now it
doesn't matter if it - or gap up short
it is going to trade for the meaning or
sometimes 70 million shares on the day
then forget about it
we're going to the next day it's much
safer nobody to fight in Jakarta trades
if you fire into it you were likely to
consistently taking losses on the
sticker for multiple times so that's why
I always tends to stay away from
strategies if I make one or two trades
and it's not going the way I wanted to
and I already created this ticker
probably two or three times then I would
straight take the day off and come back
fresh next day so here's my thoughts on
al Q&amp;A di l and so hopefully we can have
some more profitable tickers into the
next coming weeks and since we're
heading into Christmas seasons we're
giving a special holiday sale and what
there will be discounting are tier 1
tier 2 if you're interested learning all
those strategies click the link below it
will take you direct to the page and not
be the end of the video so hopefully you
guys learn something today and I will
see you guys next video

SOURCE VIDEO: How to trade on the First Green Day by Steven Dux (Weekly Recap) [rM5kmFb19ns].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
so thank you right so what's up guys do
me luck sir today we're gonna talk about
solo and sky's those two tickers that
happened for the last week and it's been
running for one or two days and it's
probably the hardest occurring event in
sorry in February let's do a quick recap
about those two tickers and today I'm
going to explain some of the little
details about the first Green Day and
how to really trade them and how to
really avoid the consolidation breakout
and later support and those are really
crucial to short sellers and you can
also really manipulate them into a
buying strategy or wrong strategies so
I'll make sure pay a little bit
attention so as you can see I'm s
and you can see there's a little bit
pushing a pretty mark you see when you
see there's no bomb in the free market
you can't really judge or to do or a
bond estimate through an entire day so
you can't really predict the entire day
volume but with this late day spikes
typically wouldn't stop pulls back and
start breaking now and for pro Tata
pretty much a high the pre-market high
becomes the support now when it brokes
out not like people like to shorting the
spikes
especially when the stock do this curve
spikes it's really hard for the parabola
to come back down that's why I typically
don't short into those spikes away from
to do the consolidations now now those
are the typical first green day pattern
that happens the most and they pulls
back great breakout and consolidate for
the entire day and track a little bit
after 2:30 when they crack a little bit
too dirty you can never tell you very
gonna cap down or cap up in the second
day because it's about 30 to 50 so now
you can look at over a chart first
support that about 90 cents second
support around $1 ish now as a penny
stock ticker for most of the company
they would love to make their stock hood
$1 because he meets the last at
requirements I would say insiders are
trying to hold the stock over one now
those are the key crucial areas and can
send the chart there's two layers of
poor weather
one one an 80s ends one at one for the
static track one dollar will be a little
bit difficult so if you're shorting
overnight and holding well Monday
doesn't hope Monday market doesn't open
so you're holding to Tuesday you will be
a bearish word there's a support around
one when it cracks you don't know if
it's gonna get up or cap down if that
sticker gets more volume than the first
screen that it's say gets about 15
medium volume on the second day and
start breaking out this 150 area you
will be a position along and sure
definitely for me that's for s KY s not
so low this ticker was spiking based
around 15 million market cap so when a
stock is around 150 200 300 million
market cap it's really difficult for
them to come back down and four it's
really it's also really difficult for
them to drop really quickly as you can
see only into the front side morning
spikes the volatility is there but after
that the authority is not there anymore
the range is bouncing back and forth
really tight now if you're shorting out
the first green day let's say you're
shooting based on the previous
resistance because you trade about a lot
of volume on Thursday and look at the
fading amount of percentage you went
from let's say used to be shorter at the
top it's a 508 and you are holding to
440 that's about sixty cents and that's
not good enough percentage to really
shore up the first green day if you
track the average doing a percentage on
first screen first red day I tend to
avoid all those takers that above 150
million or 200 meter their base level
needs to be a lot lower so they're for
solo expect from 50 million and I'm
looking more around 20 million ish
that's like massively I'm a lower flow
so when this lower flow Noro cap we can
spike to that high to the 115 million
cap they drop typically really really
quick and for solo that's the difference
between all the
cap stocks the higher demand cap is the
Lord of volatility and the tidal range
duo crayon the current day not much
going on in February
hope you guys are great trading I think
I'm a ride around 300,000 in January and
February after end of a February awawa
post my calcium's hope you guys have a
really good February I started with tips
I can give to you for this week it
should be a little bit helpful for your
future trading that we ended up the
video thank you very much for tuning in

SOURCE VIDEO: How to use stats to generate profit in 2019 Market. (With Beginner Template) [uLDCGRhlH-Y].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let's go guys doing the up Serena today
we're gonna talk about our statistics so
I get a lot of inquiry about people in
the comments below than they're saying
how about you show us that one of your
template of how to really track
statistics and today I'm going to give a
very entry level of continuity track
statistics and and the concept of
statistics and why we're tracking it
number one
tracking statistics can give you massive
confidence for you to be able to place a
trading stock market you will know how
much you will way and it's laid out and
we can go into a trail you all know you
were wearing this is the 80% chance you
can when they spread to any person of
chance we can lose out this trader so
it's very obvious and we're getting to
your trade then you're seeing your
unrealized going up and down negative or
positive sometimes even give you a
really emotional decisions let's say if
you place the trade and it berry hits
your maximum last late didn't really hit
your maximum loss on statistics you
didn't really tell you that you should
cut your losses by your emotion you said
okay I'm fear of taking this class and
you might go bigger so I will just cut
it right now as soon as you cut it and
the stock just went straight down we're
straight up goes the direction of what
are you expected and you will get more
emotional since after that you will make
emotional pretty much like chain
reactions that you'll make mistakes
again and again that is the original
reason why I checked statistics also by
checking statistics you can invent a
couple new different details and adding
to a pattern and I can significantly
increase the pattern when you percentage
like the layer resistance that will get
into the top all the complicated stuff
in our DVD that was invented by tracking
massive statistics so if you're a
beginner you have nothing to know about
statistics this is a really good video
for you to get into it and hopefully you
guys can enjoy this and here I'm going
to give us some simple concept I already
track statistics how people really
invent your statistics and how I can use
statistics to apply into our certain
strategy so let's give a very simple
example so breakout strategy lot of
people are heard of this name breakout
is basically not stock are stuck in at
the same level and let's say for two
months and one day the star decides to
break
through this large consolidation and we
call that a breakout so when you see
this type of pattern comes up then a lot
of people tends to buy and they want to
sell at a higher price so basically you
buy into what as soon as they break
through this consolidation right here
and you sell when the stock goes to a
certain price and whatever your target
is that's how breakout strategy works
now let's apply into very simple
statistics into it so number one let's
say I want to track okay where I can
enter because let's say when the stock
breaks out at certain time so I want to
see when did it break out so I can track
that stats now secondly I want to track
how far did it break out so sometimes
when you buy a stock let's say as a
beginner we all bought a stock before
and let's say I bought a two and the
stock went to three and that's sold at
two point two
all right and the stock keeps going
going to three actually FOMO I feel I'm
missing now something because I missed
out all that 70 cents or what if the
stock goes to ten you will feel like you
missed eight dollars and you will think
about well how much money did I actually
miss and you will feel more emotional
you will place emotional trades that's
how you really take a loss so now second
you want to track how far so in average
let's say you track 1020 samples and the
average they go up about 20% now as soon
as you track one let's say most of
breakout happens in the morning and it
happens on your lemon o'clock so next
time we're going to your market you
won't know okay so I will need to pay
attention and look for 11 o'clock and as
soon as the stock breaks out I'm looking
for 20 percent from this original level
so to say - and I'm looking at this the
average is 20 percent so two times zero
point two plus two so I'm looking for
zero point four and I'm looking to exit
the stock so in this way you are looking
at the statistics because out of 20
samples that all the average men's
around 20 percent even though you missed
let's say 3 4 5
you will be still feel comfortable
because you're using statistics pattern
was invented by people and the people
are trading in the market they're tuning
for so long they will see some type of
reactions that can happen multiple times
then they can see a certain actions that
does the same thing over and over again
so we call that reputations and
repetitions is basically stock performs
the same way over and over again so the
longer you practice the longer you get
into stock market you will know okay I
will know the certain patterns and they
will know what they generally dropped
you what they're generally spiked to you
if we track statistics let's say our
official entry will be at 2:00 and as a
human wearing were we're humans so we're
not that perfect we're not machines and
our entry will be let's say one point
eight we are 20 cents from let's say the
computer generated the entry and we're
0.2 away from that so next time we can
say okay I typically size in 0.2 or
under the artificial entry I'm going to
improve myself I'm going to try the
sizing at 1.9 getting closer to that to
what I want to exit the start is I want
to exit at 5 as human typically we only
get around 4.2 so after tracking enough
statistics you will find that I will get
closer to this 5 because that's where
the perfect exit is after impact so many
times your entry and exit will get
slightly better and better and better
that means that you can maximum your
reward so when you are improving your
entry when you are proving your exit you
can see a large difference at beginning
you won't see as much a very beginning
of my career I don't really track
statistics after tracking my reward
increased about 15% per trade so that's
a significantly different and let's get
into how to form Excel sheets let's see
we have our large excel sheet now I'm
going to give a simple one not a super
complicated one you can use this to
start how to really track statistics and
how to really track a certain pattern so
we're gonna have certain roles just very
very beginner level
so first I want to check the perfect
entry second I want to track what is my
average entry so yourself
then I want to track the perfect is it I
want to track yourself exit average exit
so yourself again and entry it's a
perfect entry will beat you you will be
1.5 exit will be say 3 you will be 2.2
you can't use 2-1 point 5 divided by 1
put in PI we can find that you are
certain percentage away from the perfect
entry now you can use 3 minus 2 point 2
divided by 2 point 2 you can find your
certain percentage from the perfect exit
so once you find a certain percentage
you can use this percentage to apply
into any type of stocks that you are
trading this specific pattern to be able
to get the best risk reward so next what
we're on track is so it will say here
will be samples and this is how many
tickers it has tickers let's say APCD
BCD this row will be the tickers and
once the pattern performs do you have
win or loss so if it's a 1 you put a W
if you're Selassie pull a loss
once you have let's say in the stock
market for a pattern to be reliable you
need at least 100 samples out of 110
samples 80 of them 120 of the mast once
you have that you can calculate ok award
winning percentage is 80 percent so once
you track different patterns different
pattern will have different winning
percentage some of them have 75 percent
some of them have 90 percent now when
you want to increase your size let's say
you want to build your account where you
wanna make more money more aggressively
in the stock market and you can use
these based winning percentage to
increase your position size now what I
mean by that now for higher winning
percentage you can size it and it's a
average sizing will be $1,000 you want
so if the stock can win nine out of ten
times you can size in $5,000 as long as
you have a certain maximum losses for
myself
the higher the winning percentage the
pattern
I was adding more based on the winning
percentage so that's how I really use
statistics that you really help me build
a system that can give me a really
specific sizing method so the reason why
people keep losing money in the stock
market are thinking stock market is a
scam they go in and they think all type
of different market our skin once you
track statistics you will know exactly
how much you will win how much you will
lose what is the maximum reward so do
your own research and start tracking all
different type of stocks and you will
know by yourself does this market is
actually a scam or not is it any other
mentors out there is other scam or not
because you can go in and test their
patterns to see if they work so if it
doesn't work then to scam me it works
then to guru and it's very simple now
let's get into people why keep losing
money in the stock market we have
different market cap zones so let's say
we have a ten minute market cap market
means stock basically worth ten million
in the stock market for this stocks to
increase a hundred percent we need
another ten million for 10 million
starts to increase 100 percent but what
if we have 1 billion then we need 1
billion to add in this ticker to make
the stock increase another 100 percent
now when I see people treating all
different market caps that are trading
like a 10 million market jobs are
trading 200 million market cap sometimes
we are treating a 10 billion market cap
and you will know each of the ticker or
each stocks will react differently
because there is certain money can pour
it into to take it let's say 10 meeting
gets pour into a 200 million market cap
you only got it's not gonna expect that
much only comes back five percent ten
million pour into a ten billion market
cap spike less than 1% 10min important
to attend me America you will spike 100
percent so now people are just getting
to a stock market they're realizing okay
level two what is level two how to
really read level 2 let me just give you
the straight up certain market cap will
have completely different level to their
size would be different reaction will be
will be different ten thousand
shares in the level two on the bed will
be much different when it's a ten
billion dollar market cap if there's ten
billion then ten thousand doesn't mean
anything like it's just a small size
they first a ten thousand bid on a ten
million market cap it's considered a
decent size so level two will be
different when you are trading multiple
market caps and we're treating all
different types of stocks out there if
you are trading all different caps and
you don't have statistics on each
different market caps then you will lose
because you don't know react what's the
reaction behind all these type of
tickers thank you for watching this
video hopefully you guys enjoy this

also guys Stephen Dexter so today's
topic we don't talk about a lot of the
math that you need to use when stuck in
the hot season and right now we're in
November and December those two months
are the hottest four starts to being up
a thousand percent two thousand percent
three thousand percent and some of the
strategy needs to be changing a little
bit and also had to be really selective
make sure you are picking the right
stocks and sometimes it'd be super
patient especially we are using
different patterns so right now I do
have a couple examples to show you how
to really adjust your strategies and we
forget to this video make sure to click
the like button and subscribe and let's
get into it so overall I would you'll
have a lot of tickers and I don't want
to go over every single one of them and
I'm going to pick all the tickers that
stand out
the first one is VI ve and this ticker
it was rounding about two month ago and
the form some resistance and today when
you see a stock is getting up in the
morning now when you are hour long bias
trader and you are seeing a stock Capra
knob that's a good sign for you second
you want to look for the treatment news
which there's no legitimate news and
stock is burning up for no reason and
you had to be really careful for
intraday offering so especially by the
end of the year company are looking for
more funds just be really careful
intraday offering are very likely to be
able to happen without the stock having
any type of news and this is the perfect
example VI ve so if you are long
thinking the start won't be able to drop
lower and 2.42 and to cut but this is
the stock dropped in are 56% from where
yesterday closed so Biv one of the very
good examples to show you do not buy a
stock guides up for no reason especially
with a really low flow and speed knowing
of the reverse split again and again
after your offering then make the stock
drops to one daughter can't qualify the
Nasdaq standard then you cannot do the
entire cycle so Revere split offering
again that's four we have you eat now
it's photo with another ticker and we
had the two of them now one of them is
be NGO another one is ASL and now as you
can see the stock two of those tickers
did the very similar behavior be NGO did
pretty much the same flow and market cap
AES Ln had the same flaw in market cap
there those two are very similar and
they did exactly the same type of
actions in the morning
parabolic hotel parabolic halted when
you are trading into these photo stocks
just be really careful when the stock is
holiday that means to spread and ask my
students they open is it going to be
huge when the spread is huge that's
where you have to be really careful when
you are buying you can't get a really
bad execution so when you're shorting
also going to get really bad executions
the work you trade this is if you want
to really make an entry you have to use
it in orders so in this case you cannot
use market orders you for using my
orders it's gonna be really bad for you
now for the stock is up five thousand
percent or four thousand percent when
the stock is up that much people are
thinking much differently since the
stock is irrational people will think
very irrational and all those panic and
parabolic is going to be harder than
usual the most odds you can really trade
into this type of ticker is when you
when the star tends to parabolic I would
really recommend shorting to that but
once the stop finished parabolic and it
drops into about 50 percent of where the
entire Guinea's so you can see the stock
went from 50 cents to 3 so the entire
game range will give I draw a line from
the street so in the middle of those two
lines there will be anywhere from 180 to
$2 ish
now in this case it's 1 &amp; 2 good reason
to kind of scalp into this table huge
panic when the side drop so much about
one daughter and without any bond traded
you will be a good ass to buy into those
50% holding mine and scalp a little bit
and that's the only way you can trade
this type of hot stocks because their
hottest so many times half of that will
be not pretty much not treatable and I
would just wait until the next time when
it spikes again then you can short into
these two dollars and resistance so
that's for a SLN now followed by the UI
e G so this ticker
premark again and lost a pretty much
always so again regains back
tends to push in the morning and pretty
much fail all day now a lot of people
are thinking okay well this looks very
similar than and sys happened in the
last couple weeks
stop pushed gapped up pushed then faded
all the way back look very similar to
this now the thing is when the stock is
training sufficient volume the free
market that that indicates there's going
to be volume coming in after market open
now unless Y is as soon as the market
open you pushed about 50 cents 60 cents
and ey eg as soon as they opened it did
not push 20% for beginners I don't want
to recommend how to use this type of
pattern in real time is because when you
don't have enough statistics you don't
know if your starts going to push you
don't know if the starts going to do a
5% bushings straight dump and it's why
is there a 30% push so if your are
sizing any where between that 5% to 20%
that's too big of range that means
there's too much risk if you are not
very good controlling your risk just
talking easy to shake you out and that's
the problem of trying to show into these
cappers cappers are very dangerous
especially in October November and
December because people are so active
when people wants to make money in
before holidays and everybody knows that
that's why people are doing emotional
stuff and you will never know the stock
is going up against 20% or is going to
dump not 10% since the market open and I
will just wait until the stock form the
actual resistance and then come right
after there's one of the very famous
call that the more patient you are the
more money you will make is because you
are waiting for the first wave of
eurasian of people get trapped into the
stock then you're using their psychology
to develop a strategy to be able to use
their psychology to make money from so
that is a back-end psychology for how to
really trick a pers another thing I want
to talk about is a lot of people asking
what is four rotations and a lot of
people are confused about it so let me
give you a couple examples example one
if there's a stock that has a
five million flow now throat means the
maximum you can vial will be five
million shares so if the stock is
trading ten million shares a day that
means it's twice as much compared to the
flow that means the stock is rotating
twice and that's called
two tonnes of flow rotation if the stock
has about it's a 50 million flow and the
stock is treating 15 million shares a
day that means the size only rotated at
one time and full rotations do matter
especially when you're trading really
low flow because the more of the flow
rotates the higher the stock can go so
you can kind of build statistical sheets
to track okay so let's say the stock
rotate about anywhere between two or
three times is there Bowler issues it's
a bearish let's say the style rotate
about 20 times 30 times did it drop it
into the day or did it push since the
market open so you can use those flow
rotation and frequency to really help
you to know if the stock is bullish in a
day or inspirational day and that's for
pro rotations so you have any more
questions please leave a comment below

it's the same point AC Stephen was in a
trade okay he's in the trade doing his
normal thing but he's sitting up at a
podium and there's a hundred and twenty
people in the audience and he could see
his his stt up on the huge screen right
well every time the stock starts going
up he's like okay we were definitely
quiet
we were just rooting for you
laughs you were looking at
[Music]
so uh what do you guys think about the
question I mean I think it's a good
environment interactively other traders
that have similar focus in terms of
strategy and technique and also going
through some of the same learning pains
and challenges right so you hear other
people's experience it gives you a
little bit more
you know there's there's a certain path
to endgame everybody I really like how
massive mine you kind of get that like
closer smaller group it's almost similar
to like a one-on-one session and you get
a little more attention and if you have
more detailed questions than you might
be to answer and it's not like I mean
the tier 3 challenge is already provides
a lot lots of information but as a
mastermind it gives you a chance to
answer some questions that sometimes you
might not be able to ask as detail in
the tier 3 challenge just because
there's so many details behind it's
really hard to explain yeah just to
piggyback on what he was saying you had
first of all you get a lot of
intelligent questions because you're in
a group of people that are very serious
about learning this craft and then you
have the opportunity to to ask Steven to
repeat or dig deeper on the subtle
details of the patterns that he trades
and you know learn just a much higher
level
what do you don't
it's only two days
[Music]
we need another date to short I wouldn't
necessarily say it's too short but it's
it's kind of like a timing thing in the
sense that you've got to come preparing
it first right so you know you can ask
the right questions but then also at the
same time you know getting that light
light exposure to watch Steve trading
you know also depends on what's going on
and the market that during the period
that you hear right so it's kind of like
a hit and miss from that standpoint yep
got ya
what do you think
no I think the idea that I'm something
right there that for example we're going
over the questions once we go once we
get here
so maybe good idea just to will be just
two before getting here asked with an
email
why are possible questions that get time
to even to read the your hand compare
and then he will focus on those
questions this doesn't mean that we
cannot do it these cool questions but at
least it will flow better for him
yeah because sometimes we're kind of
thinking of next question but if we can
think about those questions before
intended before the time I think that
will give him more time to prepare yeah
that's a good point
yeah from improvement from my
perspective oh it's actually better
prepared coming into the next mastermind
now that I have an idea of how it works
I can prepare myself better and from
your perspective I think the only thing
I might say is we could slow you down a
little bit in the explanations although
it's no problem to ask you to repeat it
what you did many times mostly for me
but yeah just slowing down on the more
advanced concepts
so it's really great for us to provide
two questions before but we don't know
what we don't know as well so based on
an expense for students maybe you can
even highlight some areas before the
meeting excited tossing it hey guys
which one of these do you think you
should you know dig deeper in our
section what did you do my thing was
what you just talked about today about
resistance how in the situation where
overwhelming volume is still crack down
yeah which I didn't know about as a
particular ticker that recently happened
that was about short I kind of stopped
out of it this aside the waters being
overwhelming some resistance
yeah but but you traded it and I never
really understand why until you just
explained it cuz of you know the
previous volume and simulation yeah yeah
exactly so something like yeah I knew
double a resistance but that details the
details great
that's the only thing nobody has any out
on so many boxes well we got sort of
good we got some good detailed
information on statistics and just
intricacies of the patterns I have a ton
of notes that I need to review
so it's hard to just regurgitate
everything but I have a framework of
notes that's going to improve my my
trading and improve my questions to
bring next Bachelor
yeah and I think one of the great points
of coming to this maximize the network
the network is crisis network is even
with David with all the different people
in here just putting his face behind the
name in the chat room he is worth these
more than me mugs meaning silver for the
first time I was like oh you're so
pretty you know it's okay but now I know
that we got the network to make those
questions to each other and get closer
this is one man's game right here in
your house by yourself train myself
having more people in the network to
roam questions or something like that I
think that's a great value that you get
in here - yes socially there are a
couple people that I'm very close to
that I have never met in person that I
met in the room here so that was amazing
it was great just to learning not only
from ducks but from each other
especially like some of the new tools
they used and they're heard of and just
hearing everybody's story kind of with
their own experience really kind of you
know inspires and
morally supports you to keep going
especially hearing him loss this makes
my lots would seem like nothing so now
that believes you what a bad trade Ram
may I agree with that - I mean I love
hearing everybody's stories and how they
got where they are in the same mistakes
that you know everyone else makes that
I've also made myself and it's almost
like you know when you're trading by
yourself and run the computers it's like
it's a lonely career you're always by
yourself and sometimes you feel down
because the patterns are just constantly
failing but that's just how the
statistics plays out sometimes and when
you listen to other people that they
also sometimes make seven mistakes then
you can just bounce off of each other
and learn from their mistakes as well
more mistakes are there anymore

making better trades after better trades
after better
trades and then it turns out it was this
guy named Stephen ducks and I was like
what the hell is
this so what was it during those times
that allowed you to gain such
consistency what did you do in the
beginning and then when you figured that
out how did you stick to
it um so the one I think the timing I
finally clicked it was you know I went
back and looked all through all my
trades and I was be able to distinguish

there's actually a launch mode that if
you if you click it you hit the launch
mode and you have to hit the gas and the
break at the same time and once you let
the brake goes and the car just shoot
straight up to 6
about like 2.9 seconds or 2.8 seconds
and it's really quick I don't want to
die so
well here's the
uh
steering wheel uh the car has about well
almost about like 300 miles now but I I
got it open it or I only have like about
100 mile it's brand new uh
very very cool looking and
how's driving this car and let's go
[Music]
so Steven that's here um
basically my story uh I came to United
States about three yeah three years ago
and I came here
um I don't really know how to speak
English and
I don't know how to communicate I don't
even know how to take classes so the
main problem for me is the language
barrier to learn how to actually gain
the Financial Freedom
um
[Music]
and first I looked into what I thought
it was a scam and at the end
I learned a bunch of Knowledge from his
students and him and other mentors
and I put them put the strategies
together and make my own that's why my
success it's so much faster
compared to them
and for to for me to stand in here today
I have to thank them for guiding me
through how to uh
actually gain the skills in the stock
market in stock market you can lose
money really easy and it was also you
can get money easy as well but there's
greater risk and there is greater risk
in the stock market if you don't know
how to control your risk you can you're
risking with all your money so the
strategy is basically about your risk
management
how much are you willing to lose how
much are you
before how much are you will introduced
before how much you will get so those
are the mentalities that
puts your emotion I was at the stock
market and you just can't trade by the
odds we're all humans we all make
mistakes we're all emotional but at the
end of the day if you're going to the
stock market and your your intention is
not to make money by your intentions and
me on the odds then that will give you
uh
a rational mind to put the strategy into
the stock market to make enough money
so my point is if you work hard enough
and you have enough dedications even
though English is not your first
language and you can do the things I did
I thought was pretty easy but it took me
about 6 pounds to be consistently
profitable in the stock market and I've
been learning every single day every
single strategies and you sometimes you
can't just listen to your Mentor or you
have to figure it out by your own like
what's the weakness of this strategy
when you encounter different situations
while you will do and all those things
you have to figure out by yourself so I
basically create a spreadsheet
that uh records different patterns to
uh to calculate different patterns 20
percentage and according by the 20
percentage I
uh I put bigger positions into the uh
bigger winning percentage pattern and
smaller positions into lower percentage
work but into the lower 20 percentage
pattern so that will give me the maximum
gains and
the minimum losses for my strategy if
you want to learn about the stock market
and my personal strategies you can
subscribe to my YouTube channel or you
can email me on Instagram so I will
respond I will respond to you as soon as
possible and I like to help people I
like to give back
and
if you're interested let me know
when I was trading in the first six
months I wasn't consistently profitable
and I took a lot of losses I think at
the very first trade I won about a
hundred thousand dollars
um
bye bye luck by going on and I lost
almost half of my town because I think I
don't have
a really good risk management and
I'm not very familiar with the patterns
so
I got into
reviewing all the strategies again to
use a few spreadsheets ml
but then I started getting better and
better the thing about stock market and
everything you don't get a success you
don't get respect you have to be
experienced and
like and improve on your mistakes
because we're all human and why people
make so much money
because they
they fail they know where they get
around and they improve their mistakes
they get up where they sell that's why
they got so good now either in stock
market or releasing if you're one of one
of myself three years ago
you are struggling on the bills
struggling on the rent uh
I suggest you uh find something else
that you like that you love to do and or
something like me even English is not my
first language I can still
came through
the difficult and
I can still be myself today and give my
dream cars driving everywhere in the
town and that and that feeling makes you
very very good and it also makes you
want to give back to people to help
people work
I am three years ago you feel a nerve
about the stock market you can come to
my channels and I post a lot of videos
for beginners and different patterns for
you guys doing her but if you want to
learn more if you have any questions you
can comment below or email me on
Instagram I will be more on Instagram uh

what's up guys Steven duck sir welcome
to my new youtube videos and today we're
going to talk about two main place that
happened today
bo iron and M TSL there's another one
happened s T a second so those two plays
that happened a couple days and there's
a lot of spiders with me so the key is
to catch where the moment and ship
because everything is overextended and
they extend so much you don't need to
catch the top to make thirty forty
percent of your gains so last year F I
missed it was a clear break out up in
the tree - level I didn't size it into a
missed a huge play and kind of pissed
and uh well I was lucky as I am and I
think I was lucky I didn't get shares
too sure on this one I would be totally
trapped when this one breaks down into
three toleration squeezed into the sixth
order in after hour by the gears today
it didn't take it short because italics
can expect a little bit more and missed
at 30% drop that was that was bad
well there's always opportunities so
it's see if we can catch the x1 and be
like I did catch this one and I did get
kicked out many many times on this one
and was very very confusing when the
candlestick was developing there's so
many manipulations and trading 40
million shares today 2 million flow
stocks so the morning opens and dropped
2.5 I think I took a short at 2.9 -
that's how it's gonna keep coming and I
turned inside squeezed on me I cut
losses at 3.05 took a small loss on that
take was a thousand bucks and squeezed
on me and took ashore into this massive
can break down into three thirty years
and you look sexagon squeeze against our
curry and 363 and and what right after
Khalid it dropped back to down to 310 so
I was kind of waiting for the
confirmation that when I can be opening
short this so I'm gonna start shifting
once you start breaking three as I read
read I didn't catch the top and I think
you're covering the 2.3 ish and average
from average was 3.08 to think three
point oh eight and I think I had 20,000
shares already and I realized you can
see is only 1100 because supposed to be
5,000 I think I took like three callosum
and the previous fake-outs
and I think I'm a decent LP and then
made around 10,000 so I do make mistakes
and I don't like to short first Green
Day and it reminds me of showing on the
first screen they always give you so
much stress and I'm training you don't
want that much stress even though you
won you just make you more emotional
when I'm making stupid trades and over
over trade so that will these to your
disaster for me I personally up almost
all the time so I try to keep my trading
as simple as possible try to remind self
what pattern I'm trading before I going
to apply and I'm Bo iron I did it poorly
because I this one doesn't fit my
pattern no in the morning it fits like
gap up short right after you start
consolidating you shouldn't be feeling
like a pop show anymore
so I will be looking to improve myself
in the future and I think that's all for
the to display and we're getting into
the end of this holiday sell of the
chatroom and what 0 and 0 to 3 or 3 so
if you're interested make sure to grab
it now I think the sale will be ending 2
so I think that will be it for today I
didn't make around 10,000 and of the day
we're getting into the late summer so
we're going to have a lot of play
recently just to just to make sure focus
on the moment and what's my Minister's
shifting or we can spot before the
moment that happens like STF going wrong
on the three and selling to the five
that's almost 100 percent gains 60
percent again
so I think that will be the lesson for
today thank you very much and you get a
three

because of all the shorts covered and
there's not enough what's up guys is
your voice even tux here welcome to my
new video lesson of the week today we're
gonna talk about a W of X there's very
nothing much going on for the last
couple days being really really boring
and the only play that I'm interested
which is aw X now it's performing this
really weird chart and I'm going to
explain the exact opposites and how the
chart acts really really weird now start
from the pre-market now you can see I
still remember there is about 50,000
shares on a bit and keep getting
executed and with them huge morning push
and stuffed now typically not many
people have that bigger shirts getting
executed during the pre market so that's
strange to narrow one when you see that
pre market huge soak and you see this
massive morning panic you know something
is going around and when you see this
$3.00 double pollen and start perking
into this 336 area I would rather go
wrong instead of kosher now I can see
this huge squeeze out of nowhere from
3.4 to that point four ish and kind of
fit down to three point six now probably
right here a trapped bunch of shorts
right around three point six each level
and squeeze them backed up
there's final squeeze to the four point
four again because of all the shorts
covered so there's not enough bid when
the stock come backs down now that's why
the stock dropped all the way from 4.4
to - porn a dish and kind of getting
really really choppy and close the
editor you're high into the end so when
the stock acting strange just be super
super careful especially we're showing
into weakness especially when we are
buying into strength you can easily get
trapped and lose ton of money so I
didn't trade a WX today as I mentioned
in my charm there's no ideal play for
today and this thing I only got about
eight percent the balancing in 2005
percent range so when the stock market
is really boring
people are looking to trade into the
market and that's where they start
getting nervous already start getting
emotional because they don't have stuff
to trade they want to make money now
what happens when they see potential
opportunities but it's not that good
opportunity people will still go in now
when they go in they're not treating the
right pattern they're now having the
right mindset this is where they lose
ton of money by random mistakes so when
you go into your trade ask yourself are
you trading a pattern or these pattern
at this specific ticker meets this
specific scenario for this pattern and
when they all fits then you can trade so
before you trade into this boring market
ask yourself I are trading the pattern
if you're not skip and that's exactly
the mentality of trading in the stock
market as I'm looking for tomorrow which
is I'm looking for a WX continuation
probably goes to five six maybe a decent
gap down can use to overextending Kapton
pattern since the stock is little bit
extended it's not that overextended so I
won't be sizing in too much since
there's not enough volume so when the
stock is not treating not much wrong it
doesn't leave a whole lot of back odors
so when the stock doesn't have enough
bad odors it can be really easy
manipulated that's the key one because
there's now enough volume which means
there's not enough money traded into the
stock and people with huge money can
still manipulate the stock and but if
the volume is really big something like
a 100 million 200 meetings and for
people who have big account key can be
really really hard to manipulate that
and the big boys knows if they make
mistakes and the odds are not on their
side they will easily take a huge loss
so that's why they don't want risk for
there was really really thin stocks
very very low flow choppy actions we
just wait until the start to start
trading decent money volume figure out
where the consolidating risk level is
then go Henry I think that is the right
decision to make and in our hand we're
releasing private teaching all over the
United States
we'll be in Los Angeles New York Miami
maybe in Washington when Chicago haven't
decided yet but if you're interested in
our private agent program will be only

what's up guys Steven upstairs so today
I'm gonna talk about my 2019 count
statements I was going to talk about
yearly and how the pattern adjusted and
how the pattern will the frequency of
the pattern having changed a little bit
this year so overall I'm going to talk
about patterning performances what have
stayed the same what have changed a
little bit and what we should adjust so
overall I'm also going to address some
issues or a lot of people are asking
well Steven you gonna fake all these
statements or whatever they want to say
and today I'm going to show you exactly
well my daily performances and account
statements and trades oh just changed
their website and they don't have the
PDF version anymore so I can I can show
you will be I think before the updated
version so will be before February where
I have all the monthly statements for
each individual month how much have it
profited it how much it did I loss and
hopefully after this video there will be
no more haters and stuff like that I
understand people are skeptical
like that I understand people are
skeptical about the huge performances
and people asking why if you're
performing this good why don't you start
a hedge fund why not become a hedge fund
manager I'm telling you this and for
penny stocks there's only specific
amount of volume which means there's
only let me monitor clearly you can
trade so we've tried to scale up into
millions of dollars and billions of
dollars
there will be no duty for you anymore
that means there's only maximum amount
of money can take for trade which is
correlated to how much violence being
trade on that intraday so because I do
have enough equities to trade to make
the maximum dollar per day or per trade
hopefully that makes sense and let's get
you this yearly statements and hopefully
can take something away after this video
so right now we're at trade zero which
is a broker and we're in the live chat
we're pulling out account statements
right here and so as you can see let me
close this live chat real quick this is
not a screenshot make sure I can roll
back and forth and this is trades or
website um generally first gross profit
will be 240,000 and net profit would be
two hundred forty three thousand I have
three through eight month I'm Marge this
month was a little bit big about actual
net loss I think is around seventy
thousand one of the trade because only
tracer hashers I have the Box the shares
for that specific trade and follow on
that I didn't really box any type of
shares so I have 125 thousand or 156
thousand miles other that's pretty much
all great amount and there's a couple
months I did really bad job only I
should make a lot more based on my
account size and on December I'm gonna
make ten thousand because I took pretty
much two weeks vacation to Hawaii
overall I think I did pretty good
there's still tons of mistakes to be
need to be adjusted and majorly patterns
I was focused on with bounce shorts gap
up short first right there sure and of
listening gap down now I want to talk
about this year performances because of
this year specifically we don't really
see OTC farm and dump
more adaptable patterns Durden first red
day has happened pretty much less than
10 times this year with multi-day
runners multi runners kind of died for a
while especially in 2019 by DT runners
doesn't really happen that often anymore
now follow after that we have openings
team captain I'm seeing gap down same
plane doesn't really happen that often
anymore because we've been getting a lot
of volume recently a lot of very
condensed heavy intraday volume was
being traded especially on the first day
it doesn't really perform any type of
overstating gap down either he just died
straight off and gap down and drop after
market open also if it gaps up then just
push hugely and the second green day
then squeezed everybody
I've been tracking that type of
statistics on the second Green Day I
think it's very beneficial for you to
track as well as a beginner also you
have to be able to you know correlating
and adjust your strategy according to
the market condition so this is the
yearly account statements overall made
about seven hundred ninety five thousand
so I started this account back in 2018
on April and I started with seventy-five
thousand divided by 3 so it's
twenty-five thousand on each account
size make sure well if I just lose on
one pattern five times in a row because
I'm a hitting that 10% or 20% chance to
lose then I have to back up of pounds
which total will be 75,000 but each
individual count will be twenty five
thousand have used that type of method
to make sure I don't really run into
change ten times in a row and blow up on
my account so I have a to backup pounds
to protect me from doing that then as
slowly and steadily grows account up to
I think last year was around five
hundred thousand just six hundred
thousand ish and this year was 795,000
soap us together
I've grown seventy five thousand 1.3
million to 4 million ish overall it's I
think is over a thousand percentage only
by using about three to four strategies
that's pretty much it this type of
performance tells you don't really have
to focus on ten pattern 20 patterns in a
row to be able to make this type of
gains only thing of the be war in two
way is you have to be
- no except that Palin doesn't really
come to you every single day you have to
be willing to wait for a setup to come
to you for you to be able to execute the
trade a lot of people in this general
market they really tried to chase the
money instead of trying to chase the
setups and that's why 90% people just by
looking at the money and they're so
obsessed with that how much they're
gaining per you know per trade and I
don't know if you guys have this type of
feeling before as a beginner and when I
was making a trade if I was up about
let's say nine hundred ninety dollars at
that point by statistically you should
take your profits right but you kind of
want to wait until well it's $990 I
don't know wait until you hit a thousand
dollars so I can take that $1,000 by
profits then now it makes me feel better
now that's where you are focused on the
money is that your focus the trade you
can find that type of you know habits
pretty much everywhere as a beginner
it's very very difficult to overcome
that type of psychology of thinking make
sure as a beginner focus on the setups
and focus on what pattern you're looking
for focus on the maximum risk reward and
that will give you a pretty good general
understanding of how to really make a
good trade how to execute it better how
do you become India to hide your
unrealized profit when you're in your
trade so that's my suggestion for it and
now that's addressing the haters a
little bit now a lot of people say okay
this can be Photoshop the wall this can
be whatever can be do for a brokerage or
like an auditing firm it's illegal to
lie about somebody's performances
brokerage typically make millions of
dollars they don't really care about an
individual client if they are you know
because if they lie about I do they will
lose their entire business millions of
lives will be lost and only making about
a one point three four million
Perceval with a small town and it's not
worth it for them to do that type of
thing - it's not worth it to match the
risk of order let's put it that way
that's number one reason they wouldn't
really lie about account statements and
plus our auto confirm so all of them for
a lot of people are saying okay
from bahama and it's a little bit
skeptical now let's show you a brokerage
statements that were back in twenty
eighteen and nineteen there will be a
very clear trade and how much volume
happy bought and be sold in a specific
day let's look at 2018 November so open
up this PDF well it's a trade 0 it's
either campaign and registers logo and
also we can see that account opening on
this day will be April 3rd 2018 so I
start this account on April and that's
my name and I have to block man can
never on the movement first I did not
make a trade or a second did not make a
trade and I made three thousand last ten
thousand make sixteen thousand not four
thousand last 2000 may ten thousand may
twenty eight thousand made ten thousand
four thousand then make forty three
thousand last twelve thousand May 2009
overall I made about one hundred thirty
one thousand on a month now for always
and it's due December 2018 see scroll
down net profit did you scroll down from
this and will be two hundred fifty five
thousand for that month now let's go to
January PDF and same thing
net profit I do I lose I lose when I'm
trading I'm not getting every CID on
this day I lost seventy six thousand
right so but following that day I made
one hundred thirty five thousand but
overall profit and made two hundred
forty three thousand on January I'm just
going these statements Monte Belmonte
and you can see how many shares IV I
traded it how much value about it how
much violence so this is a legitimate
account statements to show you and alas
seventy six tiles on this day and may
sir eighty seven dollars on this day
last thirteen thousand estimates 37,000
that day and overall profit on February
20 19 beginning February first ending
February 28th and that mountain made a
wonderfully to six thousand now since
trades are do the update so I can only
follow with statements right here which
is the new updated trade 0 website
version of
women's fall with March negative 143,000
that's my yearly performances I think
the beginning value of the count as I
said it will be 75,000 total spreading
into 25,000 each we're around 75,000 1.3
1.4 million in course of one year and
eight months
so overall 20 miles in total and a lot
of people I be asking me for shooting
games you see it getting harder to shore
I don't think so is a lot of people are
very eager to get into this game and
there's a cycle about Investors so
people are so eager to getting into this
industries and they're impatient there
wants to make money it's just a beginner
passion about the stock market I already
understand that because you're dealing
with real money and you want to you know
make a change of your life but this is
like a long role for you to really get
good at being consistent profitable will
take you a solid amount of time before
you can do that so as a beginner don't
rush into this industry and there's a
lot of people are more experienced than
me they can make more money than me and
I have to competing with people are
better than me so I had to stay
extremely disciplined now same thing up
to you when you're in a stock market
you're competing somebody like me that's
where you have to stay more discipline
than me for you to be able to you know
beat me in your trade and or be my
performances so that's the thing I want
you remind you beginners don't rush into
this industry study first tractor
statistics find your edge I also want to
talk about you know overall patterns
that it's been changing a little bit I
don't think I'm gonna do another DVD
soon because tuck senator has been the
most updated version for my strategies I
don't think anything has changed
Donnell Brock has been changed and also
you know first Fred day overstating gap
down OTC do pie pattern hosting double
pump and dump all those four strikes are
kind of outdated now we're sorry getting
into you know mid cap and sorry marked
large cap we're been treating these type
of patterns for a little bit of why I'm
tracking statistics um you know make
happen large cap I'm still learning
about large cap I have no idea how it
works I'm beating our caps or trying to
find
John that you always have to learn
always stuff to you know improve
facedown which I've learned I'm not a
complete you know trader so I still have
flaws and and the same to you
so the results I'll be showing you I've
been already practicing for almost four
years
it took me or large amount of study time
to really get hand of this and this is a
results if you put enough time enough
work I think you can do it as well so I
pretty much showed every legitimate
things about you know chance events at
how much money I made in the course of
twenty mile starting with seventy-five
does in our account or twenty five
thousand each
so that'd be the end of this video hope
you guys liked it leave a comment about
what do you think about twenty nineteen

Sebastian guys today I'm here with my
son Alex and he started with me on tier
3 probably a year ago now he is very
profitable and you guys want to give you
this task hey Steven are you doing guys
yes I would like to let you know a
little bit more about my career trading
as a business owner too because I run a
business sometimes I'm really really
really busy doing my other stuff here
and that thing also helped me a lot not
to over train which is super important
because I just watched the market for an
hour after an hour I have meanings and
have things to do and then I check it
back in the afternoon but it's not that
I'm in front of the computer the whole
thing you know I'm in front of the
computer to in my things but not trading
things and I know you understand what
I'm what I'm saying so that's that's
that's one of the things but I don't
know if you asked me what do you guys
want to know that you're interviewing me
so think about all right Tier three for
me has been a really amazing I could say
a highly recommend tier 3 one of the
best things was to be patient and I
learned every Sarah possible because we
have a few patterns right I first thing
about your DVD then I joined the chat
the third one I bought master as my mine
okay we bought the masterminds and after
the mastermind I decided to join to your
free they value and the content you
provided me the first time that we met I
think it was an Manhattan Beach in
California it was last year back in 2018
I remember that was in August you
started breaking everything down we
broke down the patterns we broke down
volume resistance so I started to have
great information in nomina I'm not
gonna lie but I was this the first month
I started with you I started
in that just that month I make good
money on that month then I started my my
account I started it with 30 K that's
how I started trading with 30,000 on my
account and we started with the broker
and which is a Tier three also the
webinars are amazing I'm not going to
lie the first things that I review the
webinars are posted on on the website
you can review them you can check
sometimes am bc i am not able to join
the webinars so I have to I can review
them later and take my notes and I have
like a mini encyclopedia of notes about
every webinar that it's been presented
and I think I learned also on tier 3 to
be a dependable trainer I don't need to
be listening while you are on tier 3 or
telling I think that's your main goal
that's your main goal you want us you
want everyone not to depend on you on
what you are doing you want us to be
profitable traders and try to do all the
stuff of our own and discipline yeah
listen we are you are one of them I
guess one of the most disciplined trader
that I have ever seen and that makes me
following steps I think I have my mind
my things you know sometimes I have four
more and stick things like that but I
just tried not to to trade I closed the
computer I shut it down and that's it
but that I think I became a very
disciplined trader - after join your
service and everything
you're not talking and that's a current
situation yeah I didn't talk about much
news video but they also that's all new
tops and basically love it teach is with
nobody tends to start at the market for
holiday for day twenty people thinking
I'm gonna get to school up to the
computer for the entire day about what
we do is stay in the computer for like
an hour 45 minutes and come back and
check in afternoon so you can use your
time together stuff alright thank you
Steve anything super I'm Amy let's go
what's up guys doing that sir I'm here
with my one my tears three students and
he doesn't really want me to review how
much it actually game but he started
with four figures and now he had five
figures even back over with the costume
three-month so let's hear about what he
has to say
so what do you think the politic to go
well well the tears feet was completely
like a game-changer because I was just
walking around so many veterans and so
many ways of trading trying to figure
out am I going long
I was shorting I was going long etc etc
and since I joined the tears reads like
okay you have to follow strategy and
focused on simple not simple penance but
like specific veterans yeah and just go
with it and study them like for the
biggest details you know and the biggest
thing is that you teach how you can
study for yourself
yeah and how you can discover your type
of training style
yeah inside this way so that's like
completely a game changer yeah I think
though I want to make the purpose of my
start the reason why I started teaching
is aa good information more condensed
and I give it to students and they
use that Andersonville to like branch
more into different markets different
strategies you think it's doing it and
about really happy about it yeah exactly
that's like and I started just now like
two months ago starting to discover like
new patterns that are tracking and
studying with your studying maxint
method and it's actually been working
yeah so yeah I mean it's usually it's
amazing

hello guys demdux here welcome to this
youtube videos and today we're going to
go over
some of the tickers that happened last
week and i know the market has been
slowing down
for the last two weeks so uh in the next
month we're probably going to head into
a different season
until uh probably the next stimulus
check comes into the market
and after we have a another two or three
one thousand percent gain then the
market will be back
before that let me uh go over all the
tickers that happened last week and also
in the next couple videos i will be
covering some of the techniques
and concept i have discovered in the
last
i would say a year and a half so uh it
will be a good
time to review of the methods for you to
trade consistently and being profitable
in this market
so before i start this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
let's get into the video alright so for
the last week
gme was the major play and i will go
ring
my entry and exit and also my thought
process as well
and what i learned from it and also what
should you
trade it in the next time so let's go
over the
yearly chart first historical chart
stock went from
20 dollars to 500 there were tons of
volume traded in between
350 to 500 i would say the majority of
the back holders are between 300 or
above
now let's look at the detail in uh the
200 to 300
range so between uh january 28th
to february 1st there is a decent
consolidation you can see that it's
anywhere between
240 to 250 and that's the first
consolidations you can see
the second one will be a 350
area but that's a little bit too high
since the stock faded all the way to 50
a share if the stock drops way too hard
you are normally
using the first layer of resistance for
you to risk off
so when i saw jamie went from 1 50
to 150 in the after hour i was preparing
that
okay where is my risk into the next day
and how should i risk myself because
the price range right now is not very
ideal to the 250
area before the market open i was
looking at the pre-market action
there is a consolidation between 130 to
so it kind of sets a top twice in the
after hour
around the 200 area so after market open
i chose
to short around the 150 after showed a
morning weakness
and covered into the 100 ish
so whenever you are trading a billion
dollar cap normally that
there is going to be a huge bounce right
after a huge panic
because these type of billion dollar
companies do have some type of
fundamentals so they do not drop like 20
stocks
uh like 75 percent in one day so i chose
to cover
half around uh 103
and i reshorted it into the bounds
around 1 30.
so i waited and the second bounce
actually took my risk
around 150 dollar then i covered took a
partial loss
and but the entire trade is still is a
profitable one
so looking into the next trade so the
stock data fake breakout around 170 also
testing the pre-market resistance as
well
so this type of consolidations can be a
shortable
consolidation but normally you want to
use
the major resistance for the risk of so
the major resistance for you to risk off
on the first layer will be 250. so the
second potential entry
can be around anywhere between 150 to
160 risk risking the consolidations
that's where i would shorten to and
going into the next day
as you know that every single gappers
they do normally fade anywhere between
to 75 percent so in this case gme did
fade
around 60 to 65 percent of the entire
game
and pushed into the next day into the
consolidations and faded again
so the difference between a small cap
and a big cap like gme
uh their chart actions and risk reward
they have a little difference
a small cap they do fade anywhere
between 60
to 75 percent and bigger caps if they
tend to squeeze and
head into a huge resistance zone they
normally fade around 50 percent
so personally for gme they are
very overextended and i was planning to
cover
when the stock fades about 50 of the
entire game
but the stock did perform that had more
risk award
so overall i'm satisfied on this trade
there
is one other trade i want to go over the
second ticket i want to talk about will
be riot
i think i missed the entire risk award
when it dropped from 71 to
45 dollar area you can see that normally
when the stock performs the first red
day
there is a second red day and normally
they will fade anywhere between 50 to 60
of the entire game so if you are looking
at
the entire risk award the 50 mark is
anywhere between
30 to 40 area but the chart action did
not perform what i expected
so let's go into the detail of each
day especially on that first red day so
on february 18th
this is the first time the stock went
red and it pushed
up to the pre-market resistance so i was
using that as
my risk to shorten to overall i covered
into the panic
uh pretty much with my full size i left
a little bit wanted to add around 71.
normally i do want to add into this type
of overextended gap down
but if it's a billion dollar cap the
bounce
normally bounce back to 75 percent
sometimes even more
so i'm unsure about how much you can
balance and also
my ability to read this type of billion
dollar cap level twos
are sometimes not accurate so my
aim was around 71 but it bounced way too
far
i was looking to short around into the
next day again but it faded
by the end of the day so i waited to see
if it can actually perform the next red
day
i was testing the all-time high again
so i left it alone then the stock did
the 70
consolidations and faded all the way
back to 50. so something to learn from
those two trades
uh when you are trading a billion dollar
cap their maximum dropping percentage is
anywhere between 20 to 26 percent
so they do not drop like 30 40 on the
day like a normal penny stocks
and also they do bounce really hard so
make sure when you take a position
you want to cover into the weaknesses
and also
aim for that 20 to 26 range to cover
your short positions
and also uh whenever you are shorting
into a multi-day runners
have some type of patience because
multi-day runners
do require about anywhere between two to
three days
upholding your short positions all right
so one extra things you guys can track
ever since the stimulus check that came
in each month
there is a huge wave of volume comes
right after that
so after about mid march there is the
next stimulus check coming in
so one thing you guys can track is
you can track all of the volume between
the first one and the second one
to see how much buying power was left
going into different stocks so let's say
that the first wave
i traded about riot
gme and overall traded 30 tickers
and each ticker was trading three
billion dollar so you can add them
together
to figure out what's the total buying
power of
each stimulus check so you will know
there is about 50 to 60
tickers you can play if each ticker is
trading anywhere between 500 million to
1 billion
per ticker so overall to figure out how
much buying power
on each stimulus check will help you to
generate
how many plays you have left and also to
predict
how much dollar amount can be traded on
each ticker so in that way
you'll be much more confident sizing
into this
huge volume and also have a sense of if
the market is slowing down or markets
heating up again at the same time
alright so that will be end of this
video thank you very much for watching
and i'll see you guys in the next one

SOURCE VIDEO: Is Trading Loss Good For You？ [7Ixe09yYem0].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys david dexter welcome to this
new youtube videos and today we're going
to talk about different types of losses
through my trading career i'm sure they
will happen to you as well if you are
into the training industry for about a
year or two and i do
categorize them in three different types
of losses first one will be
over treating loss second will be the
essential losses you have to take if the
pattern does not work
the third one will be the revenge losses
the last losses
will be the biggest losses you have to
experience throughout your trading
journey
so before i start this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
let's get into the video so the first
loss will be over trading laws now this
type of losses normally comes
after you traded about two to three
months
and you kind of know what's the market
condition
look like when you see a repeatable
specific action
every single morning and you tend to
believe that it's
some type of pattern all of the sudden
you're sizing in
into let's say a gap operator that
doesn't qualify as a gap up short
but it worked for the last three to four
times you kind of believe
that today it might work again and you
size in and you take a loss
and of the sudden you kind of don't know
what you're supposed to do and you want
to make the losses back
this is where that you tend to make a
second trade
take a second loss by the end of the day
that you are not sure what pattern you
traded
that's normally where over trading come
from it's normally come right after that
you take the first loss
you don't know what pattern you're
trading on the second loss is called
essential loss
this type of loss you normally take when
you are trading an actual pattern that
has a decent winning percentage
for example let's say i'm trading a
bounce short that has an
average winning percentage of a 70 to 80
percent
but that 20 of chance i'm still likely
to take a loss
then if i take a loss i call that
essential loss
those losses are pretty much unavoidable
and normally you can keep a decent
uh risk management on it so you don't
take
more than seven percent losses on one
trade so unlike any other industries
that
in trading you don't really have that
many chances to really screw up
because if you keep screwing up about
seven eight times
you're going to blow up your account and
don't really have a second chance
to trade again so you have to be really
careful with what you want to trade
and also be very aware of if the stock
it tends to go out of your risk and how
you're supposed to
actually react from that so here i do
recommend
give you guys one method to actually
avoid that type of
blowing up experience is if you made
money
now let's say you grow twenty five
thousand dollar account to fifty
thousand dollar account
you want to withdraw half of it and put
it into
as a backup account so if you're trading
a specific pattern but you
failed about 10 times in a row and each
time
the chance that fails will be 20 that
still has
a chance to happen so if you have a
backup account you can still come back
from that as i said in trading
you don't really have many chance to
screw up so that's why you don't put all
the eggs in one basket
and always keep one or two separate
accounts to support your trading career
so the last point will be revenge losses
don't try it you underestimate my power
these type of losses normally can wipe
out your entire account
now the first point i want to cover is
there's ways to prevent that
so first one you can do is you can call
your brokerage
and set up a max hard stop let's say on
the day you exceeded the 50 000
losses the brokerage will automatically
cover for you so
that's one thing you can do uh it's easy
to set up
but one thing comes in as a disadvantage
is
you cannot place a second trade
sometimes you make the first mistakes
and the second attempt normally be the
right decisions
and you have the potential to make the
losses back this is where
that it's not worth it because if you
are already exceeding your
max loss your second decisions normally
are not very good that means you're not
treating the correct pattern the pattern
doesn't have enough odds
so that's one thing you can do to
prevent max losses
a lot of people doesn't really have that
and that's why i see
people tend to go into the market for
two or three months and
all of a sudden their account is empty
because they hold and hope
so for all the points as i said above
normally
trading losses are very good for your
trading career so i do
recommend that face your losses and
admit your wrong sometimes and also try
to learn from your losses
to see what you can improve in the next
time so that will be all the points i
want to cover today
thank you very much for watching i will
see you guys in the next one

hello guys steo here and welcome to this
video So today we're going to talk about
the plays that happened last week and
what can we focus on um to make some
profits in terms of uh shorting gme MMC
and all other meme stocks and also uh
the general look on the overall Market
of what should we try to be careful with
uh because tons of players are kind of
coting with overall market and what
tickers are not by the way I have our
conference coming in in July uh in
California Iran so if you're interested
and wants to come in and share your
experience in this community or also
want to listen me talking about the
performance that I did all the trades
that I did in the last year uh 2021 I
will leave a link below and uh for you
to register so uh before I start this
video make sure to click the like button
and subscribe let's get into the video
today uh let's go over gme and AMC so
this one will be the main focus next
week take one from 90 150 so overall
it's only about 60% Gish from the bottom
and not enough risk award from shorting
so there's tons of consolidations
between you can see right here between
100 to 1006
during Friday the stock did not uh break
down of this 120 area and you can kind
of tell that if uh there's massive
support around 106 100ish there's only
maybe $10 to drop so maximum drops to
115 overall uh risk world is not that
good uh and the market is uh recovering
pretty strong in terms of uh SP so you
can kind of tell in the last couple
weeks gme is following SPI and q's uh
not until this bare Market rally is over
we won't see um any significant
pullbacks on gme and AMC so let's look
at AMC same thing not as overreacted as
gme only went up uh
40% and uh this is heavily beat down so
um we might see some decent amount of
squeeze up into the 27 or the 25ish that
would be a solid resistance to short
into same thing goes into uh gme I
wouldn't be shorting this until probably
hits into the 170 area which will
be uh right about here you can see
there's tons of volume traded between
180 to
170ish so uh we might have a solid
chance that this could get to the 170s
before you know crazy good shorting
opportunities so we'll see I think if
gme is following the overall market then
there's decent amount of rooms for this
try to continue to bounce into the 430
440 area as soon as this starts to
consolidate that's probably the time of
me starting shorting gme but uh uh
that's for the meme stocks on on those
two tickers I wouldn't be trying to go
long to gain extra 10% 20% so not enough
reward for going into the long position
let's talk about si8 so this is the
monkey pox
uh vaccine company ran up three days and
pulled significantly uh ran up again
into the resistance
around 14 area
but uh normally when you see these type
of tiers that they ran into resistance
but it doesn't have a solid
consolidation so this is where it traps
a lot of people in terms of uh shorting
into
resistance so started bouncing around
eight bounced up to 14 so it's gain
about extra 70
80% not 100% yet and there's no solid
resistance up in that area so this could
definitely uh spike in the next week uh
I would assume that this will be a solid
short if the market cap is around 1
billion this will be a solid short if it
trades around 100 million shares up into
17 to 20 or 20 to 30 area so it needs to
gain another I'll say 100% breakout of
the 17 and
and I mean for solid short so that will
be all the tickers that happened last
week uh not too much going on pretty
much everything is following the market
uh even the meme stocks as well uh
interestingly that I don't know about
Bitcoin that much it's a very highly
speculative play the Bitcoin
surprisingly is not following the market
bounds so I wouldn't be too optimistic
about Bitcoin coming back all the way to
above 40,000 uh I think we're in a
season that the market is trying to
flush out all of the D money in the
market and the retailers so I will be
really careful with even in the market
or L all those potential meme stocks so
these can get destroyed instantly
without even forming any type of
resistance so that will be end of this
video uh if you have any questions
please leave a comment below and other
than that thank you very much for
watching I will see you guys in the next

================================================

what's up guys Steven ducks here I know
you guys are waiting I told you guys our
statistic will be posted on Friday but
we delay until Saturday
sorry we are really busy and we're
trying to get things done so they're
really here it is and here's our monthly
report and I'll be telling you how
exactly I myself building my own
spreadsheets and what do I track and how
to improve your exit how do you improve
your entries and how to maximum and
minimize your losses and maximize your
profit so here it is and here is our
first monthly report and I will be
giving this out kind of freely and will
be improved into the next couple months
so our first report it's gonna be really
easy and working we're going to more
deeply later on so make sure to pay
attention and here's how exactly I track
and my thought process behind it so
here's our logo and this content would
be only for tier 2 and tier 3 members so
if you want to join our tier 2 or tier 3
make sure with our website as Steven
taxied account I will put a link
underneath my youtube and they'll be it
so let's get started and that's our
intro and we should read it and
basically way later on will be divided
stocks into three categories
low flow mid cap and large cap and so
because different caps of stocks they
react differently because the higher the
float is and higher the market cap is
and stock we act slower and they react
differently so we have to split them
into three different category two
forget the really precise data and and
also it's our first step to detonator so
that next page all right so this is
parabolic short and we basically track
this using maximum squeezing percentage
and make sure to calculate what sort of
maximum game person a chapter a pair
about a short now according to this
month statistics and your average return
will be around 25% and if you took look
what's the resistance what's the support
and how we calculate it and if you are
tier 2 member you get to access to that
but YouTube page will be only discuss
what my thought process is so we
basically calculate each tickers and
giving you what's for a maximum gaining
percentage so next time we are shooting
into a pair about sure you get to know
what's your average cover and when you
cover it at that point that's where
typically pair about short bounces so
you get to make the maximum of your
profits in this pattern I will be also
include how far are you from the topic
so what you can improve to improve your
entry point and basically if you today
if you short it one point two and you
are like twelve percent of your topic
and next time you can wait a little bit
longer and hammer into the short basic
based on statistics so after we have
enough data and you will be more
confident to go into a play and cover at
the right point to gain maximum profits
so that's our topic that's our thought
process parabolic short and there's not
more detail going to it so I won't be
going around this but go ahead and
access to the page to r02 member and
you'll be get a hang of it so next
resistance holding so we basically
basically improve my steez thesis on my
DVD and how does statistics support my
thesis and basically this will exactly
tell you when you're deep buying of a
support what's your maximum maximum gain
and what's your what's your what's your
exit supposed to be so this will tell
you exactly average percentage where you
need to take your maximum profits and
number teachers in there as well when we
go over it if you're interested go ahead
review the page support audience well
same as a resistance and the next one
I'll be going over some of my thought
process on maximum short squeeze
percentage so the first thing I'm gonna
go over is okay so if the shorts get
squeezed and how much do they get
squeezed based on their market cap and
float and what's what's the average
squeezing percentage based on three
categories and I just talked about me
cap small cap and large cap and the next
time when you are shooting into a
parabolic short and this specific market
a branch you can figure out where the
top is based on statistics and once we
get enough samples you will be more
confident to go into your play and get
to your maximum profits so to calculate
words the maximum short squeeze you can
also improve your entry so you know
exactly where the top improve your exit
impure improve your entries all the
features are based on my DVD so you have
to go in and study the DVDs are
distracting there and to understand
what's going on in this multi report and
that's one I'm going to talk about some
new strategy I'm looking around so open
volume see this is basically after you
go into the market for so long you
understand
the most value on traded in the morning
right so the more
while I'm treated in the morning that
means that most people went long and
sure into the same place now if this
Kendall gets failed and most people are
going panic because they are losing
their money so you use the open volume
divided by the flow calculate what's the
percentage amount of what's the
percentage in the flow holding at this
specific price and if the percentage are
high enough and the closing price is
lower in an open price we use pass if
the if the closing price is higher than
the open price but use fail so we use
that open volume divided by flow
percentage do you be able to calculate
and using that percentage that say if
the price fail or if the price pass we
can eventually find that percentage and
use and use the statistics to find okay
at this percentage the stock is likely
to close lower than to open price so
that's the basic top process behind that
and that's our open volume and the
pre-market gap percentage so when you
are shorting into something into a gap
up short and you want to know what's the
average gap a percentage after market
open and because when you are shooting
without a resistance most people
typically get emotional to cover their
short or they panic they sell their
positions so this statistics basically
give you the average spike percentage
after open so either you are buying or
either you are surely you know exactly
the average percentage and you know
where you're gonna sell you know where
you're gonna buy so but using the
statistics behind a strategy it's really
reliable and if you have enough samples
and back up directiy this so that's my
thought process I'm cap up short and go
ahead and read the introduction our
report and make sure go over the DVD and
because if you don't go over it won't be
understanding so that's our statistics
report on our monthly report and if you
are tier 2 and tier 3 members I hope you
can understand it I hope this can
improve your exit entry I spend a lot of
time limit so we'll be doing this every
single month and for yearly members will
give you a yearly report after the end
of the year so this is our report I hope
you guys like it enjoy thank you

so I'm going to go through the criteria
so why those takers didn't really work
when they fit I would say 50 to 70
percent of the pattern the market has
definitely shifted into a much lower
range lower range tends to create much
bigger squeezes so that means you have
decided much smaller than before and
make sure I pay attention to the volume
because we're dealing with a really low
liquidity if you sizing much bigger
comparative equality then you are likely
to get squeezed especially with low flow
those are not really fun to deal with I
would recommend in the future avoid the
12 pm bound Shore into the biotechs
especially in this Biotech Industry
brown sugar and GAP upshore their
statistics are a little bit different
compared to the normal Gap option not
sure

hello guys team Luxor welcome to this
video
[Music]
So today we're going to talk about some
of the pattern that didn't really work
in the last couple months the most
recent tickers that we have will be OCA
blph couple pound short and GAP up short
so I'm going to go through the criteria
so why those takers didn't really work
when they fit I would say 50 to 70 of
the pattern by the way we have a new
course that just came out so make sure
to check out the new course it's going
to be really helpful for the new markets
other than that let's get into the video
alright so we have blph right here I as
you can see that we have one individual
resistance right here which happened
around January 5th overall I traded
about 60 medium volume so it's a solid
resistance let's go into the entry chart
generally on the stake and see and
Consolidated around 2.2 highest 3.5
neutralized area 2.2 ish now let's go
into
this day which happened as a balance
Shore uh March 6th so whenever you're
looking at a resistance to shoot Too
Short into typically you want to look
for a consolidation the consolidation is
around 2.26 which is right about here
I can see before 2.26 you didn't really
trade any volume bomb didn't really come
in until around 3.2 that's right at the
resistance area well I'll say at the top
of the resistance so whenever you see
that there's no volume trading when it's
heading into the resistance that
typically means that resistance is
likely to be broken over here you went
through about 60 percent about the
resistance that doesn't really mean the
resistance is not active anymore it just
means that especially when the stock
starts to spike and slow grind and
between midday into the afternoon the
balance Shore winning percentage gets
reduced by 50 percent so for blph
specifically this is a failed balance
short so I would recommend in the future
avoid the 12 pm bound Shore into the
biotechs especially in this Biotech
Industry Bouncer and GAP upshore their
statistics are a little bit different
compared to the normal Gap option
downshore and also I'll go into the
midday and afternoon morning percentage
will get reduced again so uh in the
future I would definitely avoid these
type of tickers especially when the
neutralized area is really high that the
neutralized area is above the
consolidations and doesn't really trade
any volume you will need at least 10
minutes here it needs to be traded
before the ticker is tradable so total
amount of dollar needs to be traded it
needs to be 30 million so if the stock
is around three dollars it needs to
trade 10 mini shares before it's
actually tradable for you to size in
other than that if it's trading a couple
hundredk volume then it's not very ideal
now go into
lunr that happened last week
specifically February 23rd this is the
day I really wanted to short into we can
see we formed
semi-consolidation is around 1 12 120
ish and the gap down to the second day
because the yesterday only traded around
3 million shares and today the overall
I'm not only sure only traded is around
1 million whenever you are looking at
this type of double the entry type
you're looking at a pullback and go
ahead and come back and consolidate test
the resistance around 120 then fade
again but in this market everything it
seemed like pretty weak and the volume
is not there at all now first of all
let's look at the maximum reward the
maximum reward on l u and r on the
consolidation which I think is around
30. so right here 30 to 40. typically
you want to cover right before the
consolidation right if you chased let's
say around 80 70 then your maximum cover
point will be around 60 so that's not a
great reward but there's no actual
strength at the market open so there's
no opportunity to size in because the
highest Candlewood that traded the OU
was 60k in Canada or 40K candle so it's
pretty much impossible to size in and
with size without causing the shirt to
panic if you're sizing a decent amount
you will get a really bad executions so
especially for lurr these type of Trades
are doesn't really happen that often you
dipped under the 40 area support so
going into the balance short March 9th
came all the way back up to the 19 which
there's no actual solid individual
resistance traded between uh 14 to 150
there's no actual volume everyday volume
was around three four and one million on
this stage with about 6 million so
whenever you see this type of ticker
tends to come back in the midday
I would avoid on the first Green Day
when they're trading much more volume
compared to before and only trades these
double bounces into the second day when
they go back and test the resistance
again so right here I took a little bit
size around 19 covered around 14. even
though on these type of Trades the
overall gaining percentage starting from
10 dollars is about 80 percent overall
extensions back in the days we don't
really show anything that's half 80
extensions we're looking at 180 the 200
percent so uh the market has definitely
shifted into a much lower range lower
range tends to create much bigger
squeezes so that means you have to size
it much smaller than before and uh make
sure pay attention to the volume because
we're dealing with really low liquidity
and if you're sizing uh much bigger
compared to the Quality then you are
likely to get squeezed especially with
low flow those are not really fun to
deal with so uh that'll be the recap for
this video and make sure to check out
the link below for the courses and I
will see you guys in the next one

a lot of people who start out trading
they want to see like the flashy pnl the
big profit but you were looking the
opposite you were looking at people's
losses and looking at learning from
their mistakes yeah and also I know that
there's three base factors first of all
is human mistakes that's number one you
have to fix okay number two is patterns
come from psychology because if you're
making money that means other people are

but surprised even ducks here in this
video
I've interviewed some of my master
students and they came to New York and
Turner in person so you hear they will
share some of their and what they took
away from the class this will be helpful
what's the number like we're seeing the
fact that there was no instead of there
were so many trees we would have been
like ok this one and see here you know
we be in it instead we swim our like
like the shoreline I was at home by
myself and I just found all of that
taking account
to make a decision but if I did know
anything about that then a hundred
percent water sugar bag this morning so
the question was actually very different
than that did you like it was maybe we
you explain the things when we have
questions I think that's correct maybe
just having if you could have like this
resumed think about the things you
talked about I don't know
syrups sources yes like a synapses so I
guess I should think like of the the
things you the question is you talked
about oh we can go back and see a ya
know just have its structures like I can
again no idea topics and okay this is
like the falafel part what you need to
focus on what you should never do what
you should do maybe bigger market caps
this is the difference between this and
this you mean like your structure so
what happened is that we talked about
stuff that we had questions but I think
that's the reason it came up that week
is people ask a question explain to
anybody which versus you didn't have
like a set agenda because a lot of what
we went through was based on answering
our questions because basically you
talked about everything but it was based
on when we remember the questions so
instead of it
[Music]
I see the good thing about this is that
it gives you so much content like I've
taken so many seminars and there's so
much content that even if you feel
overwhelmed by a large portion of it if
you get 20% of the stick right and let's
say you do the same thing you can even
sit through the exact same class yet
today and then 20% more sticks pretty
soon enough for five times doing it all
again I've consumed so much information
so you to go back and sort of soak it in
because if I if you tested me on the
content minister I'm not gonna remember
all even if you're new to the fact that
you can keep up and understand a partion
of it that you've grown from where you
work for sure you compare yourself to
who you were you know yesterday know who
someone else is today yeah I've watched
the DVD so many times and every time it
you understand even though you think you
got it like just adding all these little
things like it's just like you always
further up and up and up that's why like
there's not even no question about
joining two three on this it could be
like even a one webinar where it's like
one little thing that you learn it's all
weekend right
yeah webinar I get the notes there and I
do I have big notes of my entries and
eggs that's really good I put the date
and what I actually do is they put the
time of the webinar so if I want to go
back from say transcribe and I can
actually go back
fast forward to that part of the time of
the webinar and he's talking about
insufficiency I've got the notes here
and I can hear him talk about in the
webinar without having the filters the
whole webinar so when I recorded my book
at record the time at 11:15 or 10:15 was
talking about insufficiency and I go
straight to that because I don't want to
waste my time looking through the whole
two hour webinar again I want to go
right to that part and my notes are here
and then my book can see actually yeah
the content of the Tier three is
obviously not what a whole weekend is
but it's two hours of either live
training or if there's not it's teaching
he doesn't just sit there and you know
he answers questions also that I asked
again but if you ask a question give you
a detailed answer that you can apply
right away YouTube videos I watch this
DVD but even here this mastermind
session there's so many things that he
doesn't have to do this for a business
that should slow your mind I mean you
think about the money the way you heard
right he's doing this because he loves
to do this any gives them meaning in his
life and if you were to discourage
others to come to encourage
there's two questions like if you're two
hours late for the contrary I would
encourage people here because a lot of
people put sameness there they need that
hope to make sure that they're not in
that 90% so for the contrary would
encourage hundred percent yeah I think
what what doctor said that he doesn't
have to do this for a business at all
because if you see what he achieved and
then he's giving is teaching everything
that he knows not because he wants to
get money for it I think it says
everything because yeah it's teaching
because wants to teach so you're gonna
learn anyway one thing I ask you a
question what I would discourage someone
from doing this I think he need to watch
the diabetes Pharaohs if you haven't
watched the DVDs at least once don't
even go to this because otherwise you're
gonna be every dollar if you can watch
the once over
I'm not even to be on the channel if you
don't watch the DVD because to
discourage people that just want to get
on
okay fortunately students how using the
class company Minister tier 2 training
for for tier 3 so you understand looks
tier 3 how do you think the class
helping complements the company events
at your 3 training
so just for me how do you think this
combined together with it I think it's I
think it's really because that's what I
was saying to before it's it's just
adding all the details that you need to
really understand this I understand why
the things that he explains on the DVDs
and the webinars work so I think
basically isn't much here if you have a
question I'm guessing yeah what's easy
like you're asking like you just gets on
the board yeah explain the course like
on the webinar debate yeah oh yeah yeah
but I think in terms of quantities like
yeah you explain things so that we
understand why it works because because
it's a midday law we have the
opportunity even if we're gonna trade
probably beginning to write so in tier 3
its 911 we go back to our Darren and the
bulk of tier 3 if there's training and
spent trade but there's nothing that
it's been teaching versus here what it
did for me this week and I've made lots
of questions and I picked up other
people's questions and made connections
that I needed to to integrate the other
things that I had so I would say that
that's the word that I would say this
weekend gives me more of that
tier 3 dozen is it actually gives me the
integration of the base that I've
created in the tiers
learning right so two or three gives me
all the training I guess ideas but here
it actually helps me put it all together
so it's more integration of all those
concepts in expanding the depth there's
a bit more the reason why behind some of
the stuff which you touch in but we
actually go into Morgan's we have the
time I think the best I think the major
mastery is is more users coming to
market so it's more help you do the
adjustments things the gap to resistance
is new within the past month I've been
taken to are lots of notes and that's
something you only talk to go relatively
recently it's happened more recently to
ethnicity so that's it wasn't something
to talk about for bananas there it's of
behaving differently and how do we play
I think that's the key for this and also
being able to understand the psychology
when it comes to trade because a lot of
people including myself was when I first
started I didn't really understand why
the chart played out the way it did and
it took me a while until I took this
course is DVD and study the material and
to really you said rationalized behind
the chart behind the seat why every
taker and why every candlestick and then
based on volume and stuff like that no
it's going up I have no stress about
issues at all no variation
there's no mastermind to are basically
get was better idea
but now he knows because veins you know
thank you
stop supportive as friends that we have
its yeah
but I usually come to like you when I'm
training if I days if I have a question
I clearly false questions for ducks and
then I'm questioned the other three four
questions already go not to mention what
happens on the day but that's that's why
I don't go him to chat because I only go
in there on an off days to see what he's
playing maybe I already have it and
that's what I'd like to because if
you've integrated assimilate enough this
information you're probably already
predicting the same things he's got a
good easy to play so yeah that's what I
got it and then I'm over there because
there's so much noise you know in fact
versus in the tier 3 chat there's not
you know there's there's pure people on
there
specifically at the report yeah it's
director breakfast it's not all right
that should be it thank you very much
and enjoy your day

this one was actually a long
opportunities because it dipped around
the support around one we break the
support right here which is uh September
26 the support was formed around 1.3 so
going long around 1.5 which is a decent
opportunity the re breakout level was
929 so 1.8 going along from 1.8 or even
around two it's not a too bad a choice
and you trade around 100 something
million 120 million shares on this day
gapped up the following day typically
we're looking at a double day
consolidations to form dollar block or
resistance for us to short into if the
stock decide to gap down now we had gap
down on following day gap down to around
20% or 15%

welcome to this new video So today we're
going to be covering what's the
correlation between the overall market
and the painting stocks and also I want
to go over the recent tickers that has
been running and some of the patterns I
discovered so uh by the way we have a
new course that's going to come out in
February make sure to check out that
course it's called Trader's Edge the
pre-sale is going to end up by the end
of this month other than that let's get
into the video so we have one CPI Nike
ml I really push the market
basically the market valued about five
percent uh the reason I want to talk
about the overall Market is what I
noticed is on every single Spike there
were different Runners that's going up
so during this Spike I think was the gme
AMC spike a massive run up into about
short then during this Spike we had a
bbby the meme stock so into this bike we
will probably have something one of the
master Runners going to come up so
opportunities will come during Market
rallies and from my take
um the overall Market the current
conditions for the General market is as
the first there's going to slowing down
the rate hikes but they're not
I would say pausing or cutting the rate
hikes the financial conditions are still
not as great compared to this massive QE
from the third so this rat is probably
going to be temporary and into this
rally uh to the end of the year we're
going to have something to play with
definitely tickers trading tons of
volume and what I noticed in this market
is during each of those rallies volumes
are massively different compared to the
market is going into a downturn so the
volume differences between the market
going down compared to the market going
up is drastically different so make sure
always use the data when the market is
going up and use the data when the
market is going down for example when
the market started writing in July to
August
and the volume is trading anywhere
between 100 million to 200 million so
you have to use
the same data into this Spike as well
and of course going to the opposite of
the market is going to a downturn
um then you want to use the same data
that when the market is down trending uh
this is one of the I would say patterns
that I found out starting of the year so
the statistics that I found out
um specifically
into this year when the market is going
to downtrend the volume is really low
basically it's not really tradable
unless you see a very ideal bounce short
with a massive Bond comparison but when
the market is on the uptrend uh the
average dollar block is around 1.5
billion so if the stock is around 10
you're looking at 150 million European
traded if the stock is around 15 then
you're looking at 100 million shares
going to be traded so I'll do the math
that's pretty easy so what we had this
week we had a d-bike this is the trade
that I placed a couple days ago so uh we
had a girl Pub fade all the way down
then form this neutralized area around
20. this is where I shorted it into the
next day as it gapped down so you
consider it as I'd say not a great
overstating gap down but I waited until
the consolidation to be formed shorted
around I think it was around 20 and
between 26 to 27. and I was going to
write it down but that we respect in the
afternoon
made me cover so I actually lost a very
small amount I think it covered around
20 not anywhere between 27 28. so uh
from my take on this trade is when the
when the stocks neutralize area is
really high so typically a gap up short
Fades 75 from the top so you can see uh
duac fitted about 35 percent uh when
expected to 30. so uh your max reward
will be 21. whenever you are shorting
around 26 27 your recovering Point has
to be above the neutronize area so
you're looking at 23 24 to cover which
uh into this trade there is not much
risk reward so that's the mistakes I
kind of made but it was not much size I
noticed that the neutralized area is
pretty high so that actually destroys my
um risk award especially on taker that
only went up 60 percent
so uh that was a very small house but
going forward into dwac on this respect
again so if this one can push through
the 29 area and this uh dwac might
actually go up to 60 because once it
breaks through the consolidations then
this consolidation area will become a
massive support
uh it traded around 30 million shares
around I'll say 27 28 so you're looking
at
1.5 billion support
uh around
30 dollar area and uh once they break
through the 30 area you have to wait
until the stock doubles from the support
area to be able to consider it it's a
shortable stock so uh be patient on
Divac I think opportunities will be
coming into the next few weeks so for pi
XY uh Master resistance only around the
65-68 area I don't quite remember this
one not that high
uh then we have a following resistance
around
39 around 8 million so typically on a
low volume ticker
when the stock only trades under 1
million shares throughout the day and
also spiked over 50 percent these type
of teachers are very difficult to trade
you have to wait until the volume comes
in especially going into the resistance
and the starting point it has to be the
volume came in around later of the day
around let's say 19. this one has to go
up at at least 100 percent from this
low volume Zone which is called
neutralized area so it has to go up to
38 to 40 before it's considered to be
shortable whenever you see a ticker like
Pixy and HKD these type takers are very
difficult to shortening to so wait until
the volume has to be at least very least
five million shares traded throughout
the day before you place an order other
than that not much going on other than
dwac and pxy so hopefully we'll have
more plays now coming into the next
following weeks that'll be end of this
video thank you very much for watching I
will see you guys in the next one

it's been a very exciting MTH there is
I'll say 20 to 30 plays across the
entire mouth uh ever since we had drug
as the main play there's a lot of
sympathy plays as biotechs technology
and bunch of low FL stocks so in this
hype it's a little bit different
compared to the hype we had in February
the main play was BMR and the flow was a
little bit bigger and it was many AI PL
most of the flow that we traded in
February was around 3 4 million maybe a
little bit higher some some we saw was
10 million float and in this specific
hype pretty much all of them is trading
anywhere between 700k to 1 million and
the majority of them are below 500k so
200k to 300K float which is not really
tradable it's considered to be a nano
float

what's up guys Steven ducks here today I
want to talk about three stocks and one
upcoming conference and MIT so this is
my imitation letters so it's going to be
a 15 April 15 2008 een in MIT in this
stat Stata Center so if you're
interested please come and it's
completely free so if I get to know
about me or get get to know about
harlotry stocks to get some intro
informations this is the rip this is
really good chance to get to know me
I'll put the link below under my youtube
videos so please check it out and you
can register from there and today's talk
I trade it and this PR is ast c and g RN
all of the three stocks has the same
comment they all feel a long-term spikes
all the time and the way to trade it is
to focus on the morning spike as I said
shorting to morning spikes are really
dangerous so you have to be really good
looking at level twos looking at how
much fun it's being traded and what's
the flow was to monkey cap and all of
that so basically it's judge basically
stretched by your market experience to
either choose to short into the morning
spike shorting to strength is always the
best thing to do shorting but sometimes
the stock keeps going so you don't have
enough time to cut your losses so that
will be a significant losses especially
on the first green day
so shorting into one in spike without
any resistance but if you know the stuff
always fell to spikes all the time and
the stock did a reverse split packing
think is February around so it
now they are likely to do offering all
the painting Stockstill x2 do they like
to pump to start in the pre-market and
dump into the morning spike and after
altitude like a offering this is how
they pump the stock and a CST on a STC
it's the same thing but they didn't do
your offering
so you see a gigantic morning spike once
you start filling the morning spike try
to test this 341 double top and start
failing and decided to sure around 2 323
turning yesh and turns out you worked
out so we are surely morning spikes it
doesn't really you don't really know
where it's gonna end to be but you can
start in your positions by writing the
trend so shorting into morning's why you
can't ever go into your full positions
and can't really sizing that much
because on first Green Day chocolate
tends to round tends to holy scans alarm
better than moti dear burner so that's
why I have to be careful with the first
Green Day shorting - morning spike grn
same thing long-term chart if you look
at it around 10 years you always fail it
spikes when they have a significant me
wrong
so back in 2013 back in 2000 back in
right now it's 2018 so they lose this
again almost a hundred percent every
single time so inspecting the stock and
tends to fail it 6.5 area and twice so
that's your indicators to take a short
positions into our strengths so when the
stock and in this stock it doesn't have
really it's not really a small cap
I would say it seeing around mid cap and
the flow is relatively high compared to
an SPR and a STC so be really careful
shooting to two stocks
I think after our had some reference
training investigate about gr and pump
so let's see how item are turns out to
be I would say there's a support area
around for 25 and 407 so let's see if we
can go that to area but right now the
trend is pointing to the downside so be
careful along this kind of stocks when
the moment and start shifting you have
to get in you have to be really careful
and overall market is dropping so I
wouldn't be long at any stocks either
today or tomorrow we'll see how it turns
out to be and that's the lesson for
today thank you very much

that's really inter brilliant brilliant
how did you do on uh did you trade
asns
asns the one yesterday yeah oh yeah yeah
I made 140 no uh 210 210 yeah 210 nice
so what that that's sort of kind of the
explanation that you were talking about
you let top run and then you wait for
those other little ones like you were
saying ml which tries to turn into the
next
top and then for example with asns was
one of those where you know you had
minm and all of those other ones going
wild and you waited for this bounce play
on asns so on these bounce
plays and the lower volume how are you
adapting to that

to fill its own spike of the first spike
yeah
it's really it's highly likely to fail
the third its happy it's highly likely
to throw the balance what's up guys
Steve and Doug here today we're going to
talk about our January and February
monthly recap more about January than
February because we just started
February brittany have made around two
hundred fifty four thousand to February
eighth and most profit came from January
it's being a decent mount MBO t I think
was ek and a couple decent bouncer and
gap offshore it's about around two
hundred forty five thousand if you - the
barrel fee and this is my account
statement that's getting to some of the
tickers that we trade in January and
February so I did a weekly recap button
beauty before so let's talk about Z K
and so in February don't have much going
on and I want to talk about some of the
traits that people are mistaken by
because now that people are trading in
too high price range they are trading
into $20 stock or $30 stock yes
sometimes you might be get lucky with it
sometimes you don't the way you wanna
focus in the market is you want to focus
on odds you wanna focus on the best
setup so you want to trade don't trade
like a gamble you want to reach that
consistency you need to practice that
habits if you don't have the habits you
can really trade that well so on gkin
this one it did a really light value in
the pre-market and we had a huge bonus
spike in the morning becomes just feel
it all the way to really begin about
this trade typically when stocks sacks
huge after the market open which it
doesn't really have or really heavy
volume the pre-market you generally
support them on in spite so most likely
you are going to expecting like a
morning pullback or something here you
really depends on if it does have
historical resistance or not not looking
at as EK in chart it doesn't really have
historical resistance it's a
fresh chart and in the morning it is
really difficult to pick up an entry
because if you don't short at the top
then the risk range will be huge and
when you are trading all those up
short without resistance if you're a
beginner I don't suggest to trade this
kind of setup if you are good with it
and says it if you set incorrectly you
can get a massive amount of risk you can
get a massive amount of risk reward of
this so if you find out it's a little
bit too risky that's okay because if the
stock get around before they will always
do a second or third round afterwards so
you will see couple bounces afterwards
in your next week or two and you will
you want to find the most consolation
areas and the next bounce if it reaches
to about $3 level you will be open in
your short became the volume trade on
the K until about 12 million volume so
it's pretty decent monitoring to you but
not really heavy now let's talk about
some of the higher range price stocks
for really a high range press stocks
something like $20 or $30 or even $10
and you are tuning into a large market
cap zones now for the ideal of penny
stock your idea of mid cap stocks how
they work about the percentage is the
more marketable you have is going to
take more money into increased
percentage gain of this specific ticker
let's say you want to EGA and you spiked
about 100 percent you need the about 300
million market cap you need 300 million
of actually cash to pull in to this
ticker to make this stop spikes over a
hundred percent let's look at micro caps
if the market cap is around 20 to 50
million you only takes about 50 million
to make this aspect 100 percent in that
case you will have a lot more range to
play into all those micro caps because
form a cap it is not a really huge hype
most of the time it takes weeks or
months to make the stock drop about 50
percent or 30 percent 20 percent
I won't suggest it trading into hiring
stocks except you are trading options
and maybe
different stories the next thing goes on
a pay attention values the historical
chart so if you look at all kinds of
heidemarie taps taps and give a little
bit better
Charlie astray so look at the entire
chart history and we'll see a little bit
consistent line including across a
couple years and the volume is not that
great so if the first individual candle
on the intraday is overwhelming all the
candles from history and they sound
first going that is a really dangerous
to shorting to you and it's not very
good to go along with if he's on a
mid-cap or large cap stocks because I
have tested the statistics almost all
large caps if we're over five hundred
million or billion dollar America it's
really hard for them to go over even 50%
if you are a short-term trader it
doesn't really work on the long
strategies I will suggest to focus on
lower caps here is the example is very
similar to Zika and so you see this
wrong TMS are you ran from three to nine
and you fade all the way back and get a
little bit bounce off here in the
february of fifth the barely hits the
resistance and fell back so this will
happen on z ki and as well we're taking
it a bit longer but if you look at the
chart they're super similar to each
other
z CIN first bombing candle fade all the
way back and if it bounces you will fail
now is atin now sorry TMS are
first Kendall with two solid individual
resistance and here is a little bit
bounce and you failed
so although spouses if the volume
doesn't offer warm the previous Kendall
volume its how do you likely to fill the
bounce of the first spike so that would
be the entire general recap for this
video there's nothing much going on in
January and February
I accept MDOT and ZK and and other
little trades there and they're not much
huge runners going back and forth I
remember last 2018 there's a huge
runners in February for a couple times
Arkady a DXR and all that so make sure
pay attention to the February I think
February is a decent season
so for hot season there will be February
during a summer and during the holiday
years so Christmas November October
that's the most active month that I
typically focus on so that'll be it
thank you very much that's the end of
the video and hopefully it's helpful
I'll see you guys next time

I think I made around 1.1 million since
last July what's up guys Steven doctor
will come to my new video lessons of the
week and today we're gonna talk about
recent runners s MIT today and we're
also going to talk about our recent
performance of 2017 July into 2018 in
July let's get into it
ms:i t classic bounce sure if you
haven't know that code review the DVD we
have a huge morning stuff the four point
one age and the four again and not
basically just killed a stop and dropped
almost 30 percent from my entry as
surely right around three point nine ish
my twitter he says yeah three point nine
five now 10,000 shares I think I locked
up pal 5k in his ticker I could be more
patient to make 7k 8k but I'd rather
take my profits with all of the trades
are doing always take partial profits
because it's safer so if the trades goes
against you you already took your
profits so either it goes against you
you can make it even or you lose your
profits that's the key in trading always
lock your profits and if the trades
didn't working and goes against you you
still have a way to go you cut it even
and you are looking for the next
opportunities because when any stock
gets more and more extended the
opportunity gets bigger now it's also
talked about MTS L and PD those two
tickers are super low flow and micro
floats when they try to what I'm
soldering and you don't have volume and
start spiking again
now you can trade that as a balanced
short now when trade them for a couple
times the price start neutralizing this
one specific area which is around two
point six six ish now if the stock
breaks out again it's going to be really
difficult to shorting to because of the
short story stocked and for really low
flow stocks it's not that hard to
manipulate stock goes over the
resistance only about thirty percent so
that's the reason why I don't like to
swing those micro flow except they're
going over 3,000 4,000
even 5,000% so you can sway on PE d for
a couple days but the speedy massive
draw already dropped about 70 percent so
60% that's nuts and they'll go but if
the start already dropped half and goes
over at 4,000 percent we're in 5,000
percent then you can hope for a couple
of days to get extra traffic but
something like this bounce shirts always
be careful when they start the price
tyrannized and you only need about 20 30
% ago with a resistant and that's very
easy to do same thing with mt SL the
mass abdominal was super manipulated and
everybody knows that and the style was
slow grinding to the 6 dumped all the
way to 2.5 not only level you're going
to dip by which it around that $3 each
level and that's it's not even good
injury time massive done because the
stock or lost 70% of its skin when a
stock is falling 70 percent of a skin
it's not a good idea to dip Bank that
stock because there's just too many back
orders something dumped into the next
day I was tempting to dip I'm around
this area but I didn't give me a chance
or it pushed on in the pre-market and
follow with Bonjour price kind of
neutralized in those 2.6 area so same
thing with me Dean around same price
range same flow it's very very easy to
break that 3.66
area so be really careful don't try to
explain on those bound shirts they are
not worth it unless you're super
confident with it because when the stock
already lost 70% of its gain it's not
even worth it is showing there's not
much where you gonna swing for 1.55
that's not even good enough risk award
because your risk is too high now let's
get into some performance that I did for
this year I think I made around 1.1
million since last July there's many
mistakes I didn't trade that well and
there's some tickers that I didn't do
that well something like GRN I think
they put I didn't do well in gbr because
I didn't try to hold end of the day tfbg
and there's other ticker
like Arkady idx are a PIL and get shares
to Chiron Apio but on the major coming
down but did cut a few bucks and later
bounce short so in this year I made many
many mistakes and I'm looking to improve
it I did get caught it was really
crowded trades and didn't really get
caught it's just too much stress yet
when the stocks getting crowded you have
to watch for an entire day your guru on
the computers and that's where you start
getting emotional start over treating
some try to avoid those trades as much
as possible and reason is there just
being out of holiday trades into I
haven't see some kind of clean trades
like today's SMI teach so this year Adam
being figured out there's a lot more
volume not more people getting into this
game every single ticular trading 20
million shares 30 minutes years 40
minutes years 50 million shares but
usually two years ago during trading for
miniatures five miniatures so the
volumes start increasing the strategy
needs to be modified as well so when you
are shorting into your low flow and
stock does have any number resistance
when stock is enrolled waiting for 10
times it is very possible to break that
resistance so that's one thing I've been
noticed this year and another thing is
when I started super crowded even though
it's not a low flow you will have those
really choppy perks that just barely go
through the resistant come right back
down and there is a lot of manipulations
going on and people either boxing their
boxing now so there's so many shares
trading back and forth it's not really
worth it to go in so you have to be
really really selective on when they
when you see a stock is getting crowded
but my strategy I don't think he has
that much changed that the volume of
resistance needs to be changed just a
little bit because the entire volumes
it's increasing and the based on the
heavy resistance needs to be changed as
well the fundamental of the strategy
didn't change because you're basically
shorting into people's holding the more
volume it trades the more backer it is
so we are shorting into more volume not
just make you short more safe so that's
basically how the strategy being changed
throughout the year
anything else I will be posting on
YouTube and hopefully this video helps
and I will see you next week thank you
very much you guys have a great day

the last section will be 500 million to
1 billion there's a fourth section but
normally I don't use at all is market
cap over 1 billion so same thing goes
into the flow uh 0 to one is considered
to be a nano flow 1 million to 3 million
is considered to be a very low flow 3
million to 5 million is low flow and 5
to 10 is a decent flow and 10 million or
above it's a bigger flow in terms of
flow you have much more sections
compared to market caps but once you
combine them together then you will have

what's up guys Steven Dexter so first of
all thank you very much for coming to
the conference and hopefully just learn
something new and benefit your trading
career in the future so today we're
going to talk about a lot of stocks been
happening for the last three month so
ever lists of takers could help
beginners to really you know start their
statistics tracking and it will be given
out a template and the list of tickers
you can track so you can go in and find
out the flow the cap and also the trend
as well and to make a conclusion or make
you know a brand new strategy for
yourself and make sure click the link
below in descriptions once you guys are
in our email list and we'll be sending
out the list of tickers and the template
for you to track for statistics so
today's min topic will be talking about
house dobro market will affecting the
stock so that we're trading right now
and I know there's not much correlations
between the overall market and micro
stocks and penny stocks are trading the
only coalitions that we have is when the
market received large volatility and
it's no bouncing 11% overall market or
dropping 10% and that will affect how
the coronavirus is behaving in the very
short term so I'm going to give you a
few examples and you can also use these
type examples to make decisions based on
the market volatility
let's get into the examples so right
here will be giving couple examples for
you guys and not all of the tickers I've
been happening for the last three months
and we received at least a couple
hundred tickers I suspect over 50%
that's qualifier criteria so I don't
really have enough time to go through
hundreds of tickers I selected no takers
a stand off the last week and I will be
giving analysis on it and also make sure
listen closely because different tickers
happens in different time zones how to
really react based on different time
zones and also doable market so let's
get into the first taker so DX is the
one of the most popular tickers I've
been trading for last two month and you
can see the market volatility
effect stocks can drop and SPECT the
same time when the overall market drops
about 10% or 12% there will be a massive
spike for this type of coronavirus
stocks and when the market starts to
become stable and without dropping or it
starts to reverse and come back and all
those cool new buyer stocks decides to
go down because people are saying oh the
market is recovering maybe the criminal
bear stocks are dead so they're studying
their shares and you can see the stock
went from Tony to $5 when you are
looking at overall market volatility and
when the market is dropping huge based
on these type of corner of our stocks
you are expecting huge Spikers ready to
open now the first of all when you are
seeing a fresh ticker is healthcare
stocks do nothing about showing and if
they didn't really expect enough and in
stock has a low flow low cap a good news
and potential multi-tier break a yes
it's a potential long now we are looking
at stocked up from the huge amount of
resistance from March or April or
February this is where it gets a little
bit tricky because at the first wave a
lot of people get excited and they're
thinking the health healthcare stocks
it's going to skyrocket and once they
buy all of the sudden they know well
micro cap stocks fundamental are
completely trash and you know long term
they drop where it came from so this
ticker one front four to 20 and went
down from 20 to 5 overall the first wave
trapped enough people who are buying the
stock now every single pounds are not
very significant compared to first wave
normally the first hype has the highest
volume and most back odours so the next
couple waves will cause
couple chain reactions now stock will
keep going up based on the market
volatility but it cannot be the first
wave of batterers because when status
has despite they are going to sell their
shares and the stock goes down so in
this case when you're looking at tickers
already spiked two months ago then do
not try to go long because that's about
decisions and also a bad idea doesn't
really give you a really good odds now
let's look at B
MRA BMR is very different compared to Co
TX you can see without any type of
historical trading or high volume the
stock went from 1 to almost 24 SIL TX
once they traded that before now onto
this screen they went from maybe 5 to 13
and dropped from 16 to 9 and it doesn't
really have the potential of spiking a
thousands of percent compared to the MRA
without resistance so in this case going
on with our resistance based on market
volatility if the market volatility is
dropping and there's a huge corner of
our sphere focused on stock that doesn't
really have historical resistance you
can focus the stock without historical
resistance so you can take advantage try
go into the long side instead of short
now when you are looking at start with
resistance then the resistance is
already formed the backers already there
and you're trying to go along then
you're basically buying into resistance
binds the first way with people that
already got trapped which doesn't seem
like has good odds
so overall CEO DX and BM are a those are
two signature charts now happened for
the last few weeks now the market
recently are fairly stable they're not
dropping fighters in every single day
one series starts to you know stabilize
doesn't really have to go up or go down
once it doesn't give you that large
volatility going up or down that much
then the market will start to fall back
to normal and all of the statistics will
go back to the same so the next thing I
want to talk about will be volume volume
is very important indicators for you to
select if you want to go long or short
as I said the first wave that formed in
Apple resistance is not the ideal for a
long strategy without historical
resistance for healthcare stocks on
large volatility for a marquee on a
thick thing will be a potential loan
based on the float the cap and the news
now let's look at in terms of volume so
volume while we typically get back in
2019 and 2018 is around 40 million and
15 million that's considered very
crowded right now we're experiencing 70
million 200 million
trade intraday and it's considered
crowded so volume itself increased about
thirty to thirty five percent so overall
when you look at the chart intraday
let's give example BMR a so it's it's
trading about 32 million volume for
three million dollar stock now in the
same market condition back in 2019 2018
it's considered crowded if you're moving
to right now into 2020 that everything
is running very high based on very high
volume 32 million is not that heavy
resistance or it's not that much fun in
intraday now this is something out to
keep in mind when you are showing into
resistance you only show into a heavy
volume as possible and BMI is 32 million
is considered heavy volume back in 2019
it's not very considered a heavy volume
in 2020 so this is considered as a
medium resistance right now when you are
trying to use your shorting strategies
always adapting to the current market
conditions and same thing we go trying
to go long if the volume is very crowded
it's very good for long so that's pretty
much of the content today if you want
the list of the coronavirus stocks that
happened in the last three month and you
also want the template for tracking
statistics make sure sign up the email
below and we'll be giving out the
template at the best we're doing a month
so that you remember so thank you very
much for watching and I will see you
guys in the next one

but it faded all the way back to 2.7 and
it's typically started after a red day
in between goes all the way to 7.6 uh
typically we need 300% extensions for
multi- honors so
2.4 * 3 that's 7.2 so just barely met
the minimum 300% extension and the here
is the mass of first red day so the
reason why I missed this trade is it
traded about 80 million shares before it
performed the massive first red day

hello guys steven dexter so today's
video
will be meaning focus down in june
monthly recap
i think overall i made close to 1.1 to
1.2 million dollars in this month
but overall i'm going to start from the
bottom and
i will be going over some of the major
takers that happened and some of the
biggest trades i made
by giving them the entry and exit and uh
hopefully it's going to be helpful for
you but i won't be really going over
every single trade because that's way
too long
then i will be explaining majority of
the profits are coming from
and coming from which pattern so you
will know what pattern to focus on to
grow your
account but uh before getting to this
video or this recap
i want to talk about my personal
experience of how i got here
and backing six years ago and i was
making
close to i would say a hundred dollar to
two hundred dollar a day
and i was thinking okay so if i can keep
this performances i will be in very good
shape of
supporting my colleges and potentially
helping my parents in their financial
situations
and at that time i will never think
about how to become a better trader how
to really focus on the process
all i'm aiming for is okay i want to
make a thousand dollar a day then we'll
be able to make a million dollars you
know in a year
and i was way too focused into how much
money i can make
so i was forcing trades there and there
back and forth and
end up losing money that's why i would
say
90 of the traders lose their account at
the beginning
so one of the very good solution will be
focus on the process
focus on your statistics how to really
utilize your statistics
to benefit your trading performances
because in that way it can
not only make you to become a better
trader and
also give you much better performances
in your long run so just in general
talking about all industries
every single industry you need
experience in there
and also you need your own method your
unique way of how to really profit from
this industry
so that would be my honest opinion don't
rush into the profits
focus how to become a better trader i
said the same thing
last video but hopefully you can keep
that in mind
and let's get into the video so in here
i'm going to explain two tickers
that caused me to take a decent loss and
also caused me to make a tons of profit
i'm going to explain the difference
between those two takers
and make sure listen carefully because
there's a lot of details in there
and two of these patterns look very
similar so
let's get into blmk first so in this
taker overall it was
a multi-month breakout and the breakout
level is around
350-ish area and
in that specific day i bought the stock
around
3.7 which was the pullback of this
initial parabolic so i was risking the
consolidation level
which is around 380 because i know
there's another support
at 360. unfortunately i was trying to
long
two or three times it turns out you
shake me out overall i think i took
about eighty thousand dollar loss in
total
in this case if i'd be more patient and
then i would be holding the sticker much
longer but
unfortunately i had a massive fomo got
shaked out around
250 ish and this i just wouldn't double
from where my entry is
all the way went up to seven but if i
was be able to
hold the ticker a little bit longer i
will make much more
so in future wise when the stock is
performing a breakout it's trading
decent amount of volume it is
consolidating above the support
then you will be a definitely potential
loan now it depends on where your entry
is don't try to enter
into a massive volume candle you always
want to find some type of weaknesses
or some type of consolidations because
sizing into this parabolic and then you
get shaked out
and then inside them and you can get
checked out again when you are making so
many mistakes into the same taker
you won't be able to think rationally so
in this case
for my mistake i think i can make much
more
but instead of turning again into a loss
always be patient always try to find out
where the support is
make sure you use a tight risk
management then you should be good to go
let's say the stock performed a
multi-month breakout in the history when
you're looking back in three years
there is tons of resistance around four
five
six seven eight overall even
it's a solid volume breakout it's having
two three red days
right here and right here so the pattern
itself is not a very clean breakout
that's why we are trying to long for
multi-day runners always look for
clean chart in three years to five years
overhead resistance are not very good
for multi-month breakout at all
so uh let's look at vxrt now this
sticker
i made close to 300 to 400
000 first of all the stock had
massive amount of resistance around
three dollar area
now right here which is 80 minutes
traded 80 minutes you're traded
so if you add all the resistance
together the overall resistance in total
will be close to 200 million now as soon
as it broke
that area which is around four
and start gaining volume around 470 in
the stock
one parabolic you can see right about
here
then gapped up in the second day now you
can see the stock performed the breakout
around four getting tons of volume late
day gapped on the second day but on this
scandal
the stock did a pr which is price
release
pushed the stock even higher once the
stock
finished spiking and had this massive
amount of resistance performing
at 10 daughter i didn't rush to short it
in because there's a massive amount of
support around four or five
so i waited until the next day which is
on monday the stock decides to come back
again testing the 10
resistance i sized it massively using
the massive resistance from friday and
i got a decent fade around it i think my
entry is
940 i covered around 640.
so i made three dollars a share and it's
a very
predictable pattern ever since then the
stock come back to test that 10
again and keeps fading once it tested
not 10.
this is a very good example for
multi-day breakout
because when you are comparing with vxrt
and
blmk uh vsrt three years there's
no resistance now very light resistance
30 million
around 470 only 20 million around
seven that's why the breakout is much
more clean compared to b01k
because blmk the stock is packing
resistance around seven
to eight that's why the stock is having
much more trouble
breaking through this area so when you
want to go potential
on always look for clean chargers in
terms of long-term history
and also you want to know where you want
to sell
now in this case blmk you know where to
sell because you know where the
resistance is
for vxrt since it's a clean chart you
can size it much more compared to bl 1k
and also the more volume you have the
more clean the breakout will be
on b1k i think i lost seventy thousand
seventy seven thousand i think vxrt i
made close to four hundred to three
hundred thousand
those are the biggest losses of the
month and the biggest game of the month
hopefully these tips are helpful always
have a tight risk
always compare your risk and your reward
make sure there are at least one to two
in terms of ratio so while you will have
a decent risk reward on every single
trade
and yeah now we end up this video thank
you very much for watching i will see
you guys
in the next one

so uh you will need to have a decent
risk management of how much you want to
risk at where you want to cover and to
be really good with your entry and exit
and to find what's your average cover
Point what is your average entry point
just in the broad area making $10 to $20
per trade is a decent practice to get
the rhythm of the market but you will
have to start going into a bigger size
to really have a basic understanding of
what's a real risk management and how to
really manage your account size uh by
trading multiple times in a week

Strategy comes from psychology, human
nature. You have to make sure that you
understand the fundamental of the
strategy, not just copying. Oh, okay.
Well, there is a higher high from the
previous day than you buy. Not from a
based indicator. It has to be based on a
psychology that people tends to react.
You kind of have to guess what people
are thinking behind the computer because
everybody basically clicking their mouth
making their decisions. Making a counter
strategy of the majority people of what
they're thinking is very important.
Number two, back testing is also very
important because statistics will give
you very accurate how where you should
go in and where you should get out and
also what's the maximum reward you can
get. Because people go in and let's say
they bought in at $2, they don't know
where they're going to exit yet. They
short at $10, they don't know where
they're going to cover and they might
miss the perfect opportunity to cover
and the stock bounces back and they miss
the opportunity. They feel formal and
they make a mistake. Then goes downhill
from

starting around
6.5 if I'm placing short around six my
risk will be 7.5 and I think that risk
is kind of too wide maximum size I will
be willing to comfortable sizing in is
probably around 20K to 30k and I will
probably exit around four the low 4ish
so I'll make about $2 a share and 20K
shares that be around 40K in terms of
profit just by looking at the chart
today I should have in some of the
shares that I borrowed because it's
definitely worth a small size even
though the risk is way too wide the risk
is too much and there is a drastic
difference on the volume because
yesterday they traded 80 million shares
and starting from on Friday you only
traded about 7 minut shares I think
before 10:00

you also want to make sure memorize the
chart because whenever you are trading a
small cap you don't have a time to go
back and look hold on wait for me for 10
minutes in a very intense situations
whenever are trading you only have a few
second maybe half a minute to make a
decision so I would recommend that you
manually track or input the current
market cap and Float on that day when
it's spiked and everything by yourself
so you can remember what was the number
and once you review it multiple times
you kind of have that chart in the back
of your mind so I would recommend Manu
input just for the memory reason

100% initial is at two opened at four
high of the pre market is at five so I
expect about 120% uh opened a little bit
less than 100% you can see the potion
percentages is almost another 50% so U
more than 50% almost gain about 3.5 so
almost 100% And for these Ty tickers
average pushing percentages they do not
work on them and if the ticker is really
crowded you always want to wait for
consolidations before you uh short uh
into any type of Spike and for these

place and some technical skills that
pretty useful in current market of this
incredible bull market and let's talk
about yesterday plates so say MDX OWCP
so in my opinion and I think OWCP is one
of the simpler place on CM BX and
yesterday I see this top did not hold
and after crack stick 6.58 I think this
Robert end of see MDX
I couldn't find any chairs to shore on
CNB extra show do w CP I showed it
you're like three or five ish then I
took some profits on the way down and
that and that took all my profits
now the second an entire doubt because
the stock is showing some strength so
I'll be really really careful with my
shorts have huge positions on autopsy P
so I rather be really careful then knows
a lot so I showed it again at two four
th and I see this crack is going down
and both obviously is going red and
added into the penet um so I changed
like a new but in the end they cans out
okay so I showed it around ninety k 88
85 k shares at 2.45 and I was covering
on the way down and my last colors 14.4
five pretty proud of the trade one of
the classic classic pattern of these
sympathy plays in supernova um and I've
heard I treated Oh W CP I was focusing
on saying the XT by and that but is that
390 H so that 430 because I see some
weakness and this stock was up so much
he might still go lower so I got scared
out by actually went to 490 so well
missed opportunity um today I can't find
any Jersey Shore Season Bicks I thought
and I know this has rooms to come down
so well that's machine I would made but
all the money on the second after the
first day that's the to play I was
talking about now let's talk about this
e y eg those two players have a really
similar has a really similar strategy
close to each other hope this works okay
now this is a really classic pattern I
figure it out myself
it only works on intraday you can see in
those two graphs similar to each other
so you had a morning push it dips down
and ended on two point five I wish you
can see this model oh here we go
alright when the stock is training so
much volume I think like here was like
coming in Mustafa bringing so much
volume you are looking for before one
o'clock so you see this squeezed up at
11:00 and it's just about people wanna
talk so before 1 o'clock you're looking
for this solid partner and let's talk
now put back of really high volume don't
worry at the first top person gainer and
only thing you're looking for in this
little perks um this solid pattern so
that's the signal for you to go long and
has really good risk of reward if you
are risking is on the bottom so you so
if I bought if I see spur if I bought it
three Oh
see if I see is perk fed bought at 360
and other skin 340 that's only twenty
cents and this might have had the chance
to break today high which is almost a
dollar share Oh
$2.00 but all are in half I don't have
risk reward so the perks before one
o'clock has really good chance to
squeeze the shorts and um what about say
um squeeze the shorts and go risk reward
so look for these
this playbook happens multiple times
that I noticed so don't miss those those
can make you a lot of money on the long
side it's probably one of my main
strategy to go for these I can't say
homeland but for this solid island and
the perks and yeah you might have heard
a good chance to break out let's talk
about afternoon perks afternoon perks
are not that the thing you're you trying
to go wrong because you're at the end of
the day people are trying to take their
profits and I won by trying to take
their pockets on the way if you see
weakness they're getting out today if
you are smartly getting on the undeb
on the perks so ey inch is not a really
good example on I remember a PRI Italian
a silicate on it he had a failed perk
and he crushed from that from from there
so you see this afternoon after one
o'clock it was a perk and to ich ein
failed and let's think that's cool I
think that's where I'm showing that yeah
that's where I'm shorting that and and
he perks again and to add into it
because I'm risking the day high and
afternoon perks doesn't have really good
odds to succeed
so then perk failed and cooked the
second day
[Music]
the more tanned up afternoon perk fails
the more chance for a stock to drop so
if it has if the stock is on
consolidating level in purchasing
afternoon and looking to shore and you
that perks and that's very useful also
on a short side oh please hurts has to
stain on a very high volume like two
days play and be in the FY you see these
I saw this perk before 1 o'clock so I
bought it at 3 to 39 and the stock
actually were not one broke this high
[Music]
I'm risking a solid bottom on to 35 and
that's sold in here to 50 because I
didn't see any strength coming from this
perk when you're in on trade your risk
and moves the stock moves so doesn't
move that much but it prevents you to
lose money so if I bought it like 335
and a series 39 I'm listening but 235
and when this dips
when this one dip I'm risking 245 my
risk moved to 30 to 35 to 245 so if you
can break this level and get out of the
trade and they don't lose any money on
me I took a small profits because on
this breakdown he loses momentum
whisperer
and what I'm trying to look for it's for
buying next time is next perk it breaks
this previous perk so so I bought it on
this breakout and 2:53 thing 3:54 and um
and after this year I'm risking this tip
so this if this dip this dip failed and
you lose momentum dispersed so I moved
my risk to 254 to 257 and that prevents
you to lose money and that's one of the
advantage to trade momentum stocks and
I'm alone can perks failed perks and
succeed perks um that's what I come up
with these how to deal with this fake
out um
Norfolk down let's talk about PTX
today I was shorting his fitness PTX ass
and it was kind of frustrating because I
was shorting out at this balance and and
when they host a low he broke this and
they come analysis 247 I sure like to
ten cut and in colour 247 and let's see
this momentum broke broke down again and
they're shorter like two for whoreish
and when you start a hose and start
working back up and this red candle
doesn't go down see here and I cover
that up for a small game and it went
actually went up
and I stopped touching there because
give so much up and down so choppy and
he filled this and breaking the day high
again and afteri cams down loses
momentum I got my shears at 2:05 I think
on the way down and I was holding this
and let's see like okay so every 10th
break high of the day fails and most
shares traded up at 4:00 so bunch of
lumps on the water and after CDs /
failed
I added into this 398 level I came out
with total 15,000 shares um
I covered a couple to half cover all
three 5th 2005 a shift 3 28 years a 30
tuning line some something like that and
because I see students coming loud I
said ok I would need to cover this and
because I know he's going to bounce I'm
going to short into the bounds and the
after a serious 360 pounds
I surely at 350 again and and covered up
at a 320 inch because I'm going because
I'm too hungry and when wouldn't cook so
that's how I play PDX um but when
morning spike doesn't hold
especially that doesn't load multiple
times people are getting frustrated with
the stock so emotional plays are we're
only on most of the time occurs in in
the morning itself filled perk
[Music]
and that's one you need to know all the
stuff I'm saying is for buying perks you
need to you're looking for the stock had
had it's more in spite this one doesn't
count as a more inspired counsel failed
wind spike its draw line touch the line
tool so stock was like this and he had
its morning spike and it kind of pulled
back sustained on this well was in a
waterless has has a solid pollen on its
level and you're looking for this part
between 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock he had
its solid pollen and this resistance the
best scenario you're looking for those
two with this stems are really close to
each other so why will why they help you
close to each other because people would
think ok so if I failed on this I have
one next really close to resistance to
catch me up so I won't be losing that
much so people will go big on this risk
reward place gifts are really close
together those are the best scenario and
if the stock is a low flow and so on
heavy volume he has a high chance to
break this solid pollen and people are
risking a solid button and their spawn
combines and short squeeze but push the
stock normally will break this day high
and you're looking in sell this um well
the higher it goes the better you're
looking for taking the profits on the
way I don't need to teach you that and
afternoon you should have a bunch of
profits taking
[Music]
for the moment in snap if the momentum
snap there should be a bounce you're
looking for t-shirt into advance for the
afternoon fade and if it doesn't fade
you get the hell out if they fail to
take the product on the way so you're
looking for the emotional parabolic
short squeeze comes right back down and
bounces and you're risking that lower
high to short the stock let's check out
if I'm talking right so that's okay
Lucas am ii by eg does it look the same
so let's see atri doesn't the same -
pretty sure
okay can't find it
is there any afternoon Spidey
okay MV f y so this look pretty much
look the same char that it has an X
morning spike okay and top down came
back and got a solid Bona and q60 so
this is not a low flow and what you're
looking for it's a low flow because I
noticed those chat rooms actually buy
these perks to mbf I was actually like
18 minute 12 so any stock under Timmy
flow it's a low flow and your while
you're looking for is a perk good risk
reward and you can put sides into it and
see let's talk about you by eg see that
see this resistance at 2:26 support to
26 to 28 and support at you 40-ish so
they're really close to each other
that's why it costs huge short squeeze
and buying that's okay this one actually
not close to each other but this first
dip was at 228 this support was that 250
so that 20 cents close to each other
and here comes the short squeeze easy
mounting easy chart all you are looking
for while you are looking for is all
like this same pattern same strategy and
um I hope you guys understand and have
them post my trade and stuff because I'm
getting too many questions on my Twitter
and sprin and my puppet account I can't
handle the too many questions so then
give me a rest for a little bit and I
like
help as much as possible I hope you guys
see this pattern Cleary
take a look into it very very useful
pattern that's what I need to trade
these slow flow stocks ok let's talk
about some ot see strategy Oh hold up
see OTC is really hard to get executed
so what do you need to do for people who
are paper trading and fear to go to or
place a trade you need to try it OTC
because that's the one of the area for
you to practice - short stretch shorting
strength covering weakness and to buy in
weakness and short strip buying witness
sell strength because you get crushed
when you trying to chase an OTC chase is
really bad for pieces of paper trading
OTC practice shorting strength covering
weakness because you can't clear see
people covering actually chasing I'm
freaking out
I can see these bounce and coming down
bounce coming down I need to
the focus that popping in working in
some binary nice something I sometimes
mix that make those mistakes too so be
really careful I left a lot of money on
the table because of those mistakes
frustrating though alright let's see
and the people asking questions what did
I trade it um I think I was showing you
I eg yesterday yeah I think I was
showing this yeah I showed it found a
balance somewhere I think I showed it
here and he bounced to 670 I cut my
losses because it's breaking the day
high and it didn't have the string to go
up and smash down and they shorted that
322 on this bounce 3:20 ish and I just I
didn't look at it all day and just keep
fading and fading and fading on cover at
end of the day that was easy short you
have to understand that if this morning
spike didn't hold and you clear
understanding most shares you can the
volume is really important you can see
most allowing are traded above here so
biggest volume was on here so it's above
3:30
so if dips down 3:30 lots of brick now
you can see people body here end of the
day so if stock price next morning was
below that end up yesterday and you can
see lots of lumps on the water so he
filled morning spike they are losing
their stuff you're going to panic sell
and
ah if you're paying some more so that's
how you get those fading all right
that's the video lesson for today and I
will do another one if at the time I
need to go work out alright I'll see you
guys in a chat room tomorrow and thank
you

nrn this is not a health care stock it
looked like it's Health Care stock but
it's a consumer discretionary so
basically I said to myself that I don't
trade botch but this one was not a botch
it's actually a regular Gap up short so
had a 3 minute float 20% pushing
percentage this is just a regular Gap up
short didn't fade 75% from the top only
fed 50% since it's IPO so that's a
pretty standard pattern to trade

the risk is too much and there is a
drastic difference on the volume because
yesterday they traded 80 million shares
and starting from on Friday you only
traded about 7 minut shares I think
before 10:00 so it's not going to uh
compete with the previous day volume
that's why the stock dropped massively
and in terms of the maximum reward
typically tickers don't mday Runners Do
not drop this far that's the trade that
I missed so the 20K trade that I placed
which is SGD the overall profits is
around 21,000 12,000 on success Traders
and 9,000 on trade zero

hello guys St here welcome to this video
So today we're going to talk about the
recent rounders in the last two weeks
and I would say in the last 1 month we
don't really have any exciting plays so
I selected about three to four plays for
you guys to take a look and also going
to share my analysis and the reason why
I traded or not didn't trade it uh for
those stickers so before I start this
video make sure to click the like button
and subscribe and let's get into the
video so the first one we have is CDT
this one was pretty much a straight fade
nothing very exciting did not push the
one that was tradeable was SLE which it
did very similar pre-market action faded
about 75% then rep pushed and
Consolidated this one didn't push it
started around 50% or 30% from
yesterday's close so it wasn't a very
good play until it reaches around 10 or
11 before it's shortable it's also lowf
flow and the biotech I would suggest to
avoid pretty much all the biotechs in
upcoming year and also end of this year
as well they are not tradable and uh
very hard to predict so let's take a
look at the most recent Runner which
will be femy this is a multi- runner did
the initial breakout around
150ish went all the way to 4 this one
was actually a long opportunities
because it dipped around the support
around one really break the support
right here which is September 26 the
support was formed around 1.3 so going
long around 1.5 which is a decent
opportunity the re breakout level was
929 so 1.8 going off from 1.8 or even
around two is not a too bad a choice and
you traded around 100 something million
120 million shares on this day gapped up
the following day typically we're
looking at a double day consolidations
to form dollar block or resistance for
us to short into if the stock decide to
gap down now we had gap down on the
following day gap down to around 20% or
15% typically when we run into a
multi-day Runners the first red day
shows about- 26% as a Max draw down on
the current day and we were already down
I think it was 20 something per so it's
not really worth it re short around 3.1
which we're already down 20% so maximum
in average we can only profit about 6%
in terms of the final day this one uh
draw down 35% it was not shortable first
of all we're pretty far from
consolidations the only part we can risk
of which will be yesterday close around
$4 so even though you can size in around
three probably can only size in about
maybe 30k to 40K shares and cover around
2.3 overall this wasn't a very clean m
TD Runners the consolidation range is
all over the place between 3 to four so
that's 30% of the consolidation
fluctuating range to pick the risk it's
going to be very difficult so I'll say
if you really want to short after the
first red day we can probably profit
maybe 15% including borrow fees and
other reason why I didn't show fpm y
because the borrow fee was extremely
expensive around 20 cents on $3 stock so
that's 10% and I'm shorting a ticket
that's already down 20% Which I don't
think it's really worth it so going into
the following potential play in upcoming
weeks MSS this is a classic IPO tickers
first Green Day up about
120% so if we see continuations tomorrow
and we all want to see consolidations
and typically IPO play needs to be over
300% so the extension itself the ticker
has to go above $12 11 to$ 12ish as the
formal consolidations depends on how
premarket action will be and hopefully
we can get a decent consolidations and
we can get overing gap down after the
consolidation that'll be the potential
play throughout this week and if you are
interested in our chat room and services

other than that I'll see you guys in the

what's up guys doing knock sir
welcome to the new week of lessons and
today I'm taco bottom VOT this is a live
account and I have made over 136,000
dollars so I'm going to explain my
thought process and exactly where I
entered where I exited
[Music]
mplt yesterday was up training all day
and there is no actually support it was
just opportunity opportunity
opportunities now even pull back so I
should attempt it short into the 4.2 ish
covered 4.4 when this one breaks and
sure it one again I think it's right
here five five twenty cover five fifty
and then I stopped reading after that
because the stock is getting crowded
you know when stock is crowded and stock
more likely to go much higher especially
on micro flow for example you can go
look at s TAF very similar pattern as
this and today you just ran straight up
to 19 so I want to start to consolidate
I want to least trap some back orders
because if it's up training people are
just gonna keep chasing now you have to
wait and venture onto the stock to
consolidate because yesterday I really
didn't have any support so today is just
straight back to the almost tuning and
if the stuff doesn't have any support
you will go down like calorie spiked
that's why when I showed it into the
Seventeen's I'm not afraid of to cover
to support because there's no support in
consolidations so when you're looking at
a multi runners or anything that is
super extended on microphone you want to
look at number one
how much violence been trading number
two is there consolidation or not
because first consolation traps back
holders second volume can actually give
you an idea how much back holders are in
a specific area so yesterday it has
volume has no consolidation we skip that
second day now the more day it goes
forward let's say ii go in the turkey in
the fourth green day the more versed in
there it is so in the second grade day i
consider to be more overextended and i'm
looking for volume I'm looking for
consolidations so today has volume has
consolidation and after because they try
to delay offering
in the pre-market now when the out once
they do the offering typically on low
floats if they do offer in premium area
it's typically dead now before even
market opens it just drop straight to
where they become but they bounced off
of time mass panic so when you're
training in the market open you want to
be aware of that because a super bearish
factor and it's even bouncing so that
super bearish can be super bullish if
you know what I'm saying because when
people think okay this factor is super
bearish I'm going to shorter even harder
now it turns to be a Polish pattern and
the stock will likely to reverse harder
than it than they used to so the stock
reversed on the 10th goes to 20 and when
you start to consolidate now the first
thing is you try to break out here you
didn't really break out you faked out so
a lot of people got trapped in this
breakup because they think okay psycho
hundred or go 50 now they're trapping 18
and then Consulate's again you try to
push again people think okay well I'll
just go and come back but it turns out
you're going all the way back once this
momentum cracked this is where you
should size in because now all this
people are treating back and forth back
and forth all their averages are around
17 they say and when it cracks under 17
people are all nervous people are trying
to sell and will cause a huge chain
reactions so when this mass
consolidation is over a couple hours you
will actually trap are loads of bad
orders because it's a macro flow and
when the microphone trading that much
volume shares are going to exchange in
each other when exchange each other all
the buyers are typically around this
specific levels so keep that in mind
consolidations are very very important
for low flow runners especially on multi
days you're looking for consolidations
in you're looking for cancellation
breakdown in the afternoon now I showed
it in the 17 because
right around here if failed failed of
this 18 so it perked he failed and now
can start to be really bearish and now
sure that 17 on a risk 18 because that
is my reward is but I can actually risk
18 point 41 so I'm risking about 1.2
dollars of total 17 dollars that
considered to be not even 10 percent so
use one point seven one point four
divided by 17 if you are thinking oh
you're risking a dollar but it's not
that big a percentage considered to be
worried I'm shorting that if you're
surely not let's say a $1000 that in
risky in thousand five that five dollars
it's not even that big a percentage of
$1000 stocks then once it broke down
here is ready should add because to risk
then you draw your average down right
about I'll say 15 to 16 years so you can
risk this massive consolidation now
we're on shorted at 17 he draws your
average down then you can actually move
your average down because originally I
become risking 18 now I added I'm
risking 17 because he actually broke
down so now if I move my wrist down I
can size a little bit more so when you
got the confirmation you size a little
bit more and you you take profits on the
way down and Manasseh Cutler was a 40 I
think you went to I went to a 22 and
this will have continuations tomorrow so
looking forward for the bounces it
doesn't there's ktuv another potential
play tomorrow 383 62 million shares
today for this doesn't really have any
resistance and support feature the
60-minute shares the eyes of tomorrow
you will be if treats more volume than
today then you'll be stay away from it
because for every for any kind of taker
that's trades over 30 minutes for me
that considered to be crowd data so keep
that in mind also and PLT don't worry
about if you didn't get yours to shore
let me give you example for ye COF this
is a really similar pattern of the mb OT
look at one your chart you had bounces 1
2 &amp; 3
you had 3 bounce tours mb OT this is
just the beginning if you give you one
pound short second one short third bound
show you give you so many opportunities
you can still make a whole lot of money
on those type of bounces so don't get
too frustrated opportunity always always
comes around people needs to learn how
to give out opportunities then when it
starts to get super chill about
opportunities they will actually be more
rational than more emotional because
when they miss their they think I'll
start on the money and they're going to
sighs even harder on on the next now a
very ideal play and I hope this analysis
is helpful and oh one last thing
typically when micro flow in a drop to
typically drop about 70% so tomorrow if
it bounces it will probably drop a
little more all right guys now be all
you have any questions leave a comment
below and you can ask me in the chat as
well I'll be it thank you very much and
you guys have a great day

SOURCE VIDEO: My $230K Gain From Last Week's Trading (HTZ Trade Recap) [8O8floIbzpw].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys steven dux here
so today we're going to talk about 230
000 winning on last friday
i do get a lot of questions from you
guys hey stephen what ticker did you
trade
there's overall about 30 to 40 tickers
that happened
last week i'm only going to select few
tickers
that really stands out and i made the
majority of the money from
before i get into this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
today we're gonna go over three points
volume fundamental analysis and
technical analysis
so on the volume section we talked about
how to really use pre-market volume
to estimate entire day volume and how to
really use volume ratios
so all those volume tricks i'm not going
to talk about today to them work on many
focus on
fundamentals and technical analysis
fundamentals
there's a lot of stuff going into it but
for
majority in small cap industry we
usually
look for 44b than 10q and we majorly
look for
a warrant offering and at the market
these type of files that we majorly look
for in ssc violence
technical analysis will be gap up short
downshore overstaying gap down
and more patterns so what we know is
fundamental and technical analysis they
have a time gap between
and usually takes about six months to a
year sometimes even more
for fundamental to really place in let
me give you an example
let's say a stock went from one to ten
that gained a thousand percent but the
fundamental
itself is really bad we have about 100
million shelf
let's assume uh 100 million at the
market
and the volume is trading about 500
million to 700 million
at that time gap these type of
fundamental analysis doesn't really
matter because the volume
is basically overwhelming the
fundamental at that time period
now after about six months all these
fundamentals going to kick in
and stock is going to go back where it
came from
so within these type of small time zones
that will create
massive risk reward and that will be
the time you should take advantage of so
here will be examples that we're looking
at htz which is the hurt
rental company and the stock basically
went from
70 cents to almost seven dollars in
about three days
we already know that the stock already
filed bankruptcy so fundamental itself
is going to eventually go to zero
just a matter of time but in that time
period it went from
almost zero to seven which is seven
hundred percent gain
in about three days so these type of
patterns will gain so much reward
to grow your small account so uh let's
get into your entry charts
now when i look at the stock first time
it gapped out it went from one to four
so you get about
200 to 300 percent first of all as i
said in the last video
when we're looking at our long or
shorter stock we want to look at market
cap
and flow at the same time this is not a
usual
small cap that we typically trade off
the market cap is around the 270 million
the flow
is definitely way out of normal range uh
it's 86 million
in terms of pushing percentages as a gap
up shore it doesn't really fit the
criteria so i don't really know where
is the max reward and where is the
maximum push
so on this day i kind of set off because
you traded way too much volume in the
pre-market
and overall volume estimate is going to
surpass 100 200 million
when the volume gets to that point there
is a lot of
irrational people trying to dip by it
will just create
more competitive situations in that day
so
then follow next day the stock breaks
that four dollar area
again another 500 million volume on that
specific intraday
with that gap down you trapped a lot of
back holders trying to buy
around five dollar area so this is where
i step in because first of all
the fundamental is really bad and they
already announced bankruptcy twice
by using overseeing gap down from
shorting around five dollars
i covered around close to four dollar
ish
so overall shares will be 55k i
made about 50 000 specifically on the
sticker
i did not choose this one because there
is a massive support around
three dollar area in terms of going
swing and for a long term
this definitely have a really good risk
award
in terms of holding it for about a month
or two personally there's so many
opportunities
for the last few weeks and i don't
really
care about if it fades a little bit more
because i can get
much more reward on other tickers that's
spiking
even higher five thousand percent seven
thousand percent
so once the massive rom forms
you will get about one or two bounces
the first bounce came down around june
12.
i showed it around three dollar area
covered around 260
because first of all the range is really
tight
overall gap is from two to three point
five so that's
about fifty percent again for a 300
medium market cap
stock it's okay but it's not great and
i showed it into this push risking the
pre-market high
3.3 ish covered around right before this
neutralized area which is around 230ish
so again about 40k trading hertz
it should produce another bounce or two
and once the fundamental really kicks in
the stock will go straight to zero
so that will be the overall psychology
behind how to really trade the mass
amount of volume
it's not really on multi-day runner
because multi-day runner needs to be
over three day on a consistent run but
for hertz you only rent for two days and
trade about mass amount of volume
when you see a massive amount of volume
it's been trading for about a day or two
that exceed the maximum volume typically
you see in daily basis
that's where you should wait for one or
two days and wait for these type of
moves to gain
about 50 in terms of reward so first
entry for me will be 550 to
4 that would be about 22 23 again
on my original position 3 to 2.5 will be
another 20
niche so around 45
uh reward overall that's really good
pattern to trade and you don't have to
worry about trading into a massive
amount of volume give you
headaches uh trying to dig by into
panics and how to really
judge if it's a real breakout or a fake
out all right guys that would be all of
the analysis today
i know there's a lot of tickers i didn't
talk about but
i will get into this later i traded way
too many tickers and there's way too
many opportunities
so make sure be patient wait for pattern
to appear
then go for your trades that'd be it
thank you very much for watching and i
will see you guys in the next one
[Music]

Then there's two other tickers. C uh I
think the mistake that was made by
myself. I think this is I think it's
available loss. So same thing since IPO
went from 11 to 40. So overall up about
400%. And we see that we tested the same
double top very similar volume. And on
the third day with lower volume of
course we did not drop at all. So on
this day I think I took a smaller loss.
If we can go into the 15minut chart.
This one is it went all the way to 50
but I think it got stopped out. I think
it's in the 39. I shorted around 38
37ish. Then of course did not catch the
top of 56 because once we did a 40
breakout around 37 36 there's a massive
support underneath. So shorting around
40 technically is not very ideal. There
is a very limited reward.

what's up guys Stephen Baxter welcome to
my new video of the week and today we're
going to talk about gbr which is going
to be my best short of the week and I
think I made sixty sixty-five thousand
what am I sitting I almost made twenty
thousand and that liable early in my
chat room I think you're very nailed it
and some women did get shirts too short
but it's okay we always get up to a
niche market right
so all those criterias and something
like gbr it doesn't happen that often
and it drops three strict to fourteen to
four dollars and people are thinking of
dip buying and thinking the stock will
bounce back the answer is no because the
the fundamental of the company is really
bad and I think they released our
flowering this morning of serving
instead of selling I think was 100,000
shares into the $11 ish so when you
think the company insiders are setting
their own stocks they don't have
confidence to cover their company in the
long term so that's what makes the stock
so bearish and the stock coming back all
the way to the $4 I think I surely that
980 s I cover you know 572 made about
almost 50% but the stock went all the
way to 4.28 I couldn't make a hundred
thousand but I convert to 80 but I'm not
ashamed I didn't make that profit
because as a trader this kind of thing
always gets in your head always being
like I can make more I can make $50,000
more or six thousand the market doesn't
owe you anything
all you need to do is to catch a
top-tier nice and to keep going never
had fear of missing out more fear of if
to stop on you there's more money
because they don't so I'm very very
happy
sixty-five thousand and not only I can
do it I certainly can do it as well so
you can interested it to our Chairman I
will put a link underneath the video let
me go over the top process on GPR so in
the morning you get up fifty percent all
the way to thirteen at first I thought
it's gonna squeeze again it's gonna have
a wake open and goes through to twenty
dollars but turns out I did it and you
smash down all the way to ten now when I
seed I have also mentioned in charm when
the stock comes back down to ten it
means it's fell underneath the
resistance from yesterday that means the
stocks perish then you didn't take that
much amount of time you just dropped had
a death drop all the way to six now
people think of dip buying to the seven
and the file came out and insider was
starting at 11
so when insert selling sub bearish news
and and people was going to the holiday
you don't want to hold a overnight and
that's why the stock dropped all the way
to almost I was saying eight seventy
eighty percent and this kind of
opportunity doesn't happen that often so
all you do is to catch the right
opportunities and from I think this year
I made around I think 1 million dollars
on one point you on there's couple
stocks there's GE RN I made a 120
thousand it's verified you can go and
see it and DX are one hundred thousand
Arcadia 80,000 and GB are sixty-five
thousand and there's another one PE D
forty thousand and so those kind of
opportunities they don't happen often
but they do happen they do happen about
ten times a year now all you need to do
is to catch those opportunities we can
make begins what I want to say is it's
not about how much money I make it's
about catching the right opportunities
because if you're over traded in the
market you can't win because we're
humans the way we make emotional
mistakes
so trade less as possible that makes us
less emotional and once you have an
experience you can you know the
opportunity is coming and you have to
get ready and that's what he needs to be
happened to for you as a trader today as
not as a simple to play of GPR which is
a sa yes and they had a death drop as
well simply play off the GBI as I said
in my DVD all the sympathy players comes
down harder in the main play so which
means sympathy people typically drops of
100% of their game because they have no
news now the main play you happen
because it has some kind of news so
that's why sympathy play drops harder
and as you can see dropped almost 100%
win 21.5 so that's a usually stop and to
the coming weeks if they bounce it would
be shorting to the balance and there's
not that many wrong opportunities as
well let me think there's one
opportunity we can use second wind a gap
of strategies buying PD but it's not
that risk reward I think that's the only
opportunities we have for the past
couple of weeks
yeah Congrats to my students who've made
20,000 and I think he's doing really
really well now the difference between
short and long and short has you have
typically take a little bit more risk
but you it's safer it has more winning
percentage by my statistics showing and
the loans you have a little bit little
bit more risk than sure it's a little
bit less safer but you do have more
reward because when you're sure you can
only make 100 percent your position but
when you are alone you can make over a
hundred percent your positions so that's
the difference between I'll ensure and
if you are short sellers if you are
wrong you can make money on both side
and just make sure which side you are
more comfortable with and let's just
pick a side because it can be a long
line sure you can't be lying sure but
almost all traders as a bias I think
that will be here for today and if you
guys interest to the chat room and I
think tomorrow is a holiday so I will
give a coupon code for you guys for
almost all tier 1 2 or 3 or 3 and the
DVD as well and make sure check it out
and we're only gonna put these cells in
about a week so sale will be in a week
and go ahead make sure check it out
thank you very much and you guys have a
great day

a strange one. Then NMAX, this is not a
biotech sector, not a Bitcoin sector. We
went from 14 to 265. There was two trade
that was made on this ticker. The first
trade is when it went to 190 and came
back down to 110. So 50% draw down. And
once it had a bounce, it took a size
around 154 risking the 190ish. The
sizing was relatively small, but I did
took a loss right about here once the
fully breakout happens. I did not touch
it until the next day. Majority of time,
we typically don't short something that
gaps down 20 to 30%. But this is so
overextended that the stock is up around
1,00500%.
Took some size around 160, added in the
140, then added in the 130, covered all
the way back in the 50s. Majority of the
cover happened around '7s.

what's up glass didn't knock sir today
I'm going to talk about my monthly
performance on February made around
160,000 in generally I made around at
two hundred fifty four thousand in this
month it's a little bit slower and
previous month and there is none as much
opportunities that we had for the past
two weeks so one of the major play that
I did it was on ft and W this ticker was
spiking huge in premarket once they had
the morning spike you've continued with
it all day and today as well I didn't
get opportunities but I think one of the
major thing is is to wait for the right
setups to come you have to be always
focused on not try to over trade through
out the boring times because if you
don't get a play and you feel like you
the market only money that's going to
end really really bad I ain't gonna
force yourself to play one stock and if
you lose the first one then you feel
like I need to make my money back then
you force another trade so it will cause
engineers cheering reactions for you to
start over trade and that habit it's not
good maitre d that the market has been
changed for a little bit we have seen
massive amount of volume trading on your
puncture gap up short so have to be
really really careful paying attention
to the volume volume tells you
everything katia volume tells you that
when the stock gets crowded it's leaning
towards the long side now when a stock
is trading less volumes meaning towards
to the short side it doesn't have to be
minced or to the short side but if it
doesn't have enough liquidity if it's on
a downtrend you will lose more the
clarity's once it loads more clarities
stock is going to continue to drop some
takers for tomorrow be sqr this is one
take her down we can attention to thank
he released his earnings winner doesn't
really have that much resistance in the
history now one other thing is when the
stock pushes over let's say a consistent
resistance zone if it's getting too
crowded flow rotated about two or three
five times it becomes unpredictable we
have to trade like a fresh shark
especially when you're using consistence
not individual resistance so for
consistent resistance as you can see
let's say the consistent resistance is
around six six dollars and now you see
those little bit of volume trading on
this conservation zone but it doesn't
really camp a lot of backwards in there
so when the stock traded saturate about
twenty million shares hitting at six yes
it is a resistance but if you start to
trade and having its flow rotation is
not really trigger but once it breaks
the consistent resistance when Z Falls
come back it will have that support
level so I have tested many times that
if you are using consistent resistance
and you stock starts to flow rotate it's
really easy to break the consistent
resistance
I love seeing couple examples and one of
the ticker
I was really be careful on was on a CHP
now look at now there's a load of
resistance on this chart puncture
resistance a sixth outrage and in spikes
to expected to 4.40 a now let's take her
and I intraday trade about seventy
million shares in the in the morning I
saw that ok well the stock is going to
overwhelm the resistance volume what I
should do there so when you see that
loads of volume traded add open don't
force yourself in especially you see the
candle if I pull up the two-minute
candle and especially you see the can of
us trading over 800,000
meaning volume at open if you force
yourself into at open and then either
you're gonna get squeezed on the short
side or we're gonna get fake down on the
long side because there is so much
action in the morning it's better just
to wait for about let's say ten minutes
until the stock slows down first then
just use the pattern try to figure out
the stocks going down
it's doing some kind of consolidation
this is my chance to go now for a
crowded stocks especially trading let's
say 50 70 million 100 million volume on
intraday you will always have our
opportunity to go in entry that you will
never lose any kind of opportunities for
go wrong at the long side if the starts
getting crowded most of the time the
stock pulls back and start to squeeze so
I will probably try to mean towards the
long side especially on lower flow once
a trades mass amount of volume and
starts to consolidate Dan can think
about shorting by shorting into Crowley
stocks there is super dangerous so I
it's the last couple days in February
hope there is something can pop up I
think I'm doing pretty good in February
and I haven't had a red mouth since
August maybe it'll be earlier yeah
that's about it nothing really happening
on February thank you very much for
watching and I will see you guys in the
next video

each section has seats very short videos
very easy to learn and it's not gonna be
a long string of videos so just practice
each sections and will be much better
tuner if you're interested in furthering
capital you will take you to the DVD
link and it's getting to the recap
what's up guys - dr. today I'm gonna do
a recap about June trades there's all
kinds of stuff going on PRV bjh X and V
Y so I'm gonna majorly go through those
tickers and how to really analysis them
and also how to reduce power instead um
potential momentum where is the
potential option in movement and so
let's get into it
um PR BB this is a really strange week
opened and massive parabolic right after
that typically when the market cap this
market has wrong magic happens around
160 million certificate around 100
million cap it's really difficult for
recited Parabolica 100 percent and when
you see the socket reading really thin
volume thin bond which is considered
that the parabolic of all um-- is under
10 million so since the stock is really
high priced the volume of course
shouldn't be that much because it's more
expensive people buy less shares because
if the price is more expensive they can
only buy 10,000 we can only buy thousand
shares because if the price is like say
20 cents they came by 200,000 shares so
the reason volume was really low is
because there is really high priced
stocks
surely into this parabolics is really
difficult into a hyper stock first of
all it's really thin so considered to be
at the same volume it's really difficult
to get executed
since the bid and NASA are so spread out
so I made the temp to show it into the
18.5 and I took a lot in the 20s and I
didn't really treat after that I think I
took like a 3k loss on PR VB so on jhx
and this one one was a microphone recap
as you can see and microphone and micro
cap it's so difficult to predict where
it's going on God look at this porch and
faith and push and failed again so it
gets really choppy and for Gallup Shore
especially on like three ATX micro flow
stops I would recommend to touch it
either going long or short and there's
all kinds of chat pompom involve them so
they might just blow up your risk and
there is market maker into time before
eliminating those low floats so uh
Michael Phelps not suggest to trade mby
and we're gonna talk about this the
stock is up over a thousand percent
I doubt some 500 anyone found literally
30 cents to $5 on Monday you can see all
kinds of there's no candle in the middle
and there's all empty spaces those are
hot and the stock was pretty much
getting hotter every single minion and
hot about it 30 times on the day and
when the stock is up that much the stock
hits like a critical point
everybody is shorting based on
percentages you have to be really
careful when the stock hits a critical
percentage is like 500% 1000% people
think oh it's up too high I'm going to
short it the answer is no you have to
really focus on the chart and sort of
focus on the percentages on the first
point I did not touch it the volume was
super crowded
second day I thought the pre-market
volume was sufficient enough to really
support to start going up but it turns
out I didn't
if you zoom man you can see how my tummy
held this actual 3.31 area once it
crapped that three turns ultimate
downfall
I took an entry into this bounce and I
think a covering to the two to tens and
made about 60 cents and made thirty five
thousand as you can see this is my live
account they realize thirty five
thousand and this is actually a live
account and you click main Shore list
you can answer about yours going back to
mby when the stock is on first green day
it's definitely not horrible on the
second green day
it can't be sharable but you have to
show up the moment and completely shifts
because let's say on low-flow when the
stock holds his dip for like 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 10 times no stock holds 10 10
people get frustrated especially on
short servers once it cover it caused a
huge spike and do a breakout again and
just break all the short sellers and
turns into a lot of short squeezes so
always wait until stock finishes its
panic we alter the balance and sure
after it and you can hold over nine to
four extra probably going crap
more tomorrow because this is after a
first gigantic first right day always be
patient for screen day don't really deal
with a headache
don't Trello floats wait on to the sub
shift for massive drop shorting to a
balance or we under the stock forces
like a consolidating price something
like right here it's a consolidation
area around 17 that's all the recap for
today and the taxi owner is coming out
the new DVD course and if you guys are
interested click the link below there
will be a button taking straight to
there to just pretty much all the new
updated market strategies and it's going
to be really helpful and I think all
those tickers and hopefully the market
comes back markets already back so let's
see more players in the future I'll be
it for today's breakout thank you very
much and you guys have a great day

Language: en
hello guys dxer welcome to this video so
it's been about a month and a half and I
want to do a recap with all the tickers
that ran the last two weeks and uh we
definitely got some interesting plays so
make sure pay attention to some of the
things that that I found out that I
discovered for um some of the pattern
changes before I start this video make
sure to click the like button and
subscribe let's get into it so starting
at end of July
to well of course we're not in end of
September yet but overall we made about
I've made about 300 close to 325,000 and
there's some tickers that I want to
cover first of all is uh qh this one you
can actually push into size because it
has traded sufficient enough volume so
on September 11th we had a massive gap
down from 4 to 3 almost to 1.7 so faded
about 50% of its gain so it had a small
push uh at a small size into here for
this type of play you should swing for a
few days to get the best reward you can
see in a few days if fit it to $1 but
the reason why I don't like it and that
it didn't push in the size because it's
under $3 stock and uh even though you
traded 300 Min shares on the previous
day but it's on you know 70 cents stock
so there's not much money that was
actually traded in this ticker 300
million share trading at 70 cents that's
about 200 million 3 00 million is thatll
being traded on that day so not very
ideal but of course you can definitely
uh sing about let's say you want to risk
the risk is pretty wide so maybe siing
up to 30k 50K shares to gain 20K 30k
reward if you decide to swing I be might
be a little bit better so that's for qh
I made about 40K 50k on this one overall
not a good ticker to push into a
significant amount of size but much
better than T so this one looks like a
pump and dump chart and uh it went from
basically 13 14 into 100 almost $1 93 if
you go into the intr HR had a massive
gap down it had its push into the 75ish
so I took a decent Shore into I think
it's the once the breakdown happened I
think it's in the 68 69 is didn't write
it because wasn't very comfortable you
only traded about 1 minut shares
throughout the day and the minimum
requirement for daily volume needs to be
4 million so he needs to trade the same
amount of shares as the previous day and
also the amount of dollar traded is not
sufficient as well so typically you want
to see at least $150 million being
traded in that day so traded about 1.8
time 75 so that's barely 150 million
going into a second day gap down a
little then you can see didn't drop that
much and still holding to the 66 is so
whenever we are shorting into a massive
multi- honors and the ticker needs to
trade sufficient enough volume that's
number one number two it needs to gain
enough percentages above the initial um
support level if you are lacking either
of those criterias then the pattern is
not likely to work and it's very liquid
so it's very easy to get stuck into it
if you decide to place a swing short
into this type of a load quinting

simply click the link in the description
below to get started now let's dive back
into the content all right so the
another interesting one will have Gs IW
the last time I remember it was LR did
uh basically an Insider selling uh
selling n going down 99% this one is a
little bit difficult to catch uh it's
formed the over gap down pattern in gap
down from the previous day then didn't
even try to push he tra traded 70 minut
shares on previous day then just keep
going down and there's personally I
think there's no way to size into this
because on each candle on twoin Char
candle you only traded 250k shares
that's the highest one of course if you
size a you want to consider where your
risk is there's no such thing as a risk
because premarket bonds pretty low then
previously close it's a parabolic
squeeze so there's no actual
consolidations for to risk overall into
this maybe potentially sizing small
amount of shares going to the open using
over stain gap on pattern risking the
$10 and potentially add to the push but
to be able to get into full size on GIS
GSW it's not very viable unless you
decide to take a massive risk I did
notice some somebody's selling because
typically when ticker goes into support
and if still the level two appears to be
a massive selling orders then there's
likely a chance that ticker will
continue to go down but that's not
something that you want the base off to
place a trade uh not very ideal overall
this month we have lot of biotechs and
very low flow tickers like a bnci like a
700k float biotechs with very very low
flow as well I would highly suggest if
you're a beginner or if you are trading
maybe in your first two to three years I
would highly just suggest to avoid those
tickers because generally uh you're
likely to going to take them loss on
that and borrow fees tends to be very
expensive so there a lose lose
situations so and that's something that
I want to suggest if you have any
questions make sure to leave some
comments below and we'll be happy to
answer and uh that'll be it all right
guys uh thank you very much for watching

so there's many ways to collect Market
data today I'm going to give you the
most efficient way and the way that I
personally use for myself so first of
all you have to track market cap float
uh stock price by itself and how much is
up by the end of the day and also what's
the maximum gaining percentage during
that specific day so uh once you have
those five terms tracked up you will
need to spread them into three different
sections so first section will be that
the market cap is under
100 million uh second section will be
100 million to 500 million uh the last
section will be 500 million to 1 billion

what's up guys doing Baxter welcome to
my new video lessons of the week so
today we're going to talk about MTS lcao
I sign all the place last week and I
think there's major change in market and
almost all stocks are really really
crowded
there's one examples like the oh I earn
non-examples buy ticket now GE and ye so
when the stock is trading over 10
million volume on the first hour and
typically overextend it's more than the
short sellers can expect so sometimes it
is squeeze take it all over to the next
day sometimes they fading afternoon but
as a major shorter you want to shorten
to really fast bikes come X down really
fast we can make the profits really
quick bundles really credit rate is
really tough to predict where they're
gonna drop and how they gonna drop and
when it drops if it's a fake out or it's
a fake break out fake breakdown so it's
really hard to predict so on the first
bring day with really crowded trades I
suggest you to rather avoid shorting it
or try to go potential : because there's
more extended level compared to all the
policing stocks so let's also talk about
you I and I think as I mentioned my
Chairman the major crack was $3 here I
think it showed around 310 there are
roughly 10,000 on this one maybe 20,000
and when those are traits that I have a
major moment in shifting it is really
easy to go into next day and be not
really safe 20 percent
so first 30 trades major breakdown and
completely shift its momentum really
safety early to next day for that save
20% gie I think this one's a little
choppy so it's not that obvious in the
yet he didn't really gap so I would
rather avoid on GE
so MT SL which is treated around 12
million shares
July 11th and you didn't bounce that far
so I would like to maybe muster 334
update for short that's just my thought
process and you can see it's not really
parabolic it's grinding its breaking
those and there's a very little bit pull
back I think this game this one can go a
little bit further I will try to reserve
shares but I wouldn't try to show right
here into a bit more dangerous their
risk is little bit too wild say oh I
double top into 5 and trading I wanted
to show this one but it doesn't give me
enough Vince because where I'm gonna
risk there is no hardcore core
resistance interesting too but that $5
on number is probably you want my risk
to do it but didn't pull the trigger and
missed I went to so another stuff is
popping up here this is another Treasury
stock that is moving again hopefully
which is not only enough for me to to
get short positions now for recent
market either they're super crowded you
can potentially go along in the morning
or a Java so far can take a potential
shore into the morning spikes so there's
all different ways you can play with the
stocks so the major thing is to catch
the momentum because and especially in
the summer
all those stocks goes 5,000% 1,000%
become backs down 70% so I'm a major
shore or going mom if you can make 25%
of your positions that's considered to
be a really good trade so no need to be
rush on all those rushing to a play
circuit over trades into your account
and that's the bad way to grow your
account so I think that will be entire
analysis for last week and this Monday
and our monthly reports coming today and
make sure to check it out and if you
want to see our monthly report I'll have
to go into the link that I founder this
video click that purchased air tube and
we'll be updating monthly report every
single month and also will tell you each
month what happens what kind of stock is
ordinary the welcome steps are modernity
and while we can come up if to fix adapt
to the new market so on I think that
would be it and thank you very much you

there's gonna be something about me and
how I got started where I come from and
how much money did I start it
what's my journey and I'm also gonna go
over some stock charts analysis and talk
about my recent two-month performance
also I'm gonna review some strategies
that is very popular in the recent
market so for the last part we're gonna
have some Q&amp;A if you guys have any
questions and being mad and I hope to
throw all those questions and we're
gonna discuss some hot tubs recently I
came to United States in 20 2010 when I
started in college at the first year I
started with engineering major the way I
think about all the educational system
that you for an average person you're
going to college with a huge student
student loan then after several years
you graduate you start working on a
day-to-day job 9:00 to 5:00 and then you
spend a couple years to pay off your
college debt and suddenly you have a
family whatever house loans or car loans
have you paid off
so before we can be debt-free can that
you probably are four years over thirty
years old so what I want to do is I
don't want to do that and I always
looking for some kind of opportunities
to invest into somewhere as on the side
so I started trading in the market but I
have no idea what I'm trading so most of
the time Trading ETS so I'm at first if
you are trading something or you don't
know you are taking a huge risk and most
of people in the market they are hearing
something from other people saying that
hey this may be Bitcoin is really really
hot or maybe some new technologies are
really really hot
so you're following other people's
ideas and you don't really understand
how they work fundamentally so when
you're going into and if you make money
and you think you're lucky if you lose
money you're blaming me on somebody who
give you that I know most of people are
invest into stocks that 9 out of 10
people lose money and only that one
person can make money so the odds are
really really small if you think about
how many rich people are in the world
it's probably the same percentage maybe
even lower then let's start tracking my
data and to see what kind of method
works so I went to multiple people's
that share strategies with me of course
we pay for them so I'm trying out
different strategies and I've at the
very early stage I don't really
understand that you have to focus on one
specific strategies to grow your account
now it was kind of everywhere I was
focusing on this Sun that and
turns out for the first I would say two
monthly didn't have any any no growth or
performance so after I start tracking
data after ever I after I start focus on
one specific strategies and that started
noticing something that there's going to
be that one pattern that works 85
percent of the time and I'm going to
start with a specific strategies when I
like what my account they started
growing to six figures seven figures I
can start branch out so that is my plan
then after 2 3 months I started with
27,000 for four I started in 2016 and
that end to now April 2018 I've turned
$27,000 in to 2.8 million dollars so and
then that gives you a totally different
mentality that anything is possible and
I am the one who achieved therefore hard
work into it and I finally do you
understand hard hard work pays off for
last part in personal winning percentage
for now is I think is around I would say
80 to 85 percent thirty five thirty five
percent of the time I think one of my
highest winning percentage was in the
summer I traded 56 trades at 154 so -
now we average it up so my average is
like 70 or 72 or 73 if you want to check
the accurate percentage you can check
out on the property I post all my trades
on property and it's all verified so
nothing fake going on there
alright this is the chart I want to talk
about this is the first pattern focused
on growth my accounts significant be if
you guys don't know the stock reverse
split basically the stock decreases flow
and increase its price but actual volume
change so in March the stock trade about
if you guys don't nest within the chart
I'm gonna experience this beginning so
volume is how much how many shares been
traded on the current day and decide if
the stock went from I would say starting
from 4 to 12 so you went to 4 to 12 in
that current day so went up to 300% then
the green candle is the stock it's of
course going up and read kendo means
starts going down so my main strategies
are shorting the stock which I'm betting
a set to go go down your very long the
stock basically you are buying and you
wish to sell in the higher price and you
make money now if you're shorting the
stock you are selling the stock at
higher price and you want to buy back
into lower price so you make the range
in between so the first spin the stock
let's go back to the strategies so we
can see the statute is 6 million shares
in March and went up to 12 and the same
after two weeks later the stock went up
again you mean from 6 to 12 again so in
stock market we call the dead tub in
here called dirt resistance and whatever
downwards we call support so right now
we're gonna focus on the resistance so
think about people's mentality most
people in the stock market doesn't know
anything that they want they want to
follow other people's alerts and we
don't know the fundamental of the stock
your if you are blinding follow people's
alerts we call that typically you go
into suffering and you lose money so we
call that bag holders and now think
about people's psychology when people
don't know anything that they're trading
these specific stocks and and if I don't
know anything about the stock market I
see a stock is going 200 300 percent on
a day what am I gonna do I'm gonna I'm
gonna buy it - baby I wish tomorrow is
gonna go up another 300 percent so I can
make 300% in a day and now suddenly when
you buy the stock then start signing
goes down now what are you going to do
you don't know you don't want to lose
money so you're gonna hold the style
until the stock comes back again now if
your next few weeks to stop come back up
then if you are holding stock at $12 so
let's stay at March
I bought the stock at $10 or $12 and you
went down something went down I have no
time to sell and wish the stock to come
back again so I can bring I can get my
money back so when the stop cubics
Turner goes up to 12 what's your
reaction you bought the stock as well
you suddenly want to sell them because
you want to break your loss even right
so that will cause a certain volume into
the stock now also if Emma short sellers
thinking about okay I'm gonna find some
kind of price to shorten - I'm betting
the side to go down now I know
the previous people that already treated
two weeks ago and there who use that I
know they cannot sell so I'm going to
short into the stock first I know
they're going to snow
I'm not sure seller something will I
will cause to start to go down also
there's two factors that will cause the
start to go down and I'm going to pick a
risk level because when you are trading
a stock you don't you're out of control
because for buying so let's say if you
go you can't buy a stock at two dollars
and the maximum you can move is stuff to
go to zero then you lose 100% now if I
sure that stock at two dollars
the stock goes to ten twelve twenty have
to buy it back
now that's over a hundred percent I can
lose a thousand percent on short
settings so when you are short no stock
trading stock to go down you have to be
you have to have a really specific risk
level for you to focus on all the time
so if you let that one loss to go off
you can do you can blow your entire
account your day and so now I focus on
the the risk level on in March the top
is at twelve dollars I can see the
second candle or the second lines a
little bit lower than the first one
because that's where short sellers
campaigns you know they picked that
twelve dollars at their risk so if i
shorted 1180 I'm risking twelve dollars
because if tope tope dollars brakes have
to cut my losses but for the odds of
winning since you know there's one
factors starts going to go down because
the previous people gonna sell second
you're gonna short self so as long as
your risk level are really tight you can
make all the range of the stock comes
comes back down so I'm risking maybe 20
cents to 30 cents per share and my
reward will be four dollars a share so
that's very very good risk reward and
for this trade
because it's really it's really my bread
and butter type of strategies I made
over almost a billion dollars on this
trade and you can see the average gain
of short sale Regency is 25% if your
short sell if you make average around 25
to 30% that's a really really good trade
if you make over 50 to 70 at the
accident trade so for your strategies
you worked really well for me and let's
go over next one so next one this is my
top three strategies that I always use
because in a stock market there's always
going to be a balance between girls and
stop coming down or dropping so let's go
into detail that and so you see the
first the the the stock is going
parabolic parallel parabot means does
that have consistent in Green Day's
almost every single day I never had any
kind of pullback so he didn't hat didn't
drop a single day so for local companies
you takes them years or 10 years 20
years 30 years for them to become really
big companies and what happens when the
stock goes 10 1 to 10 in a day there's
going to be some kind of bubble in it
because people are hyping it up and if
you're a - you're love but there's going
to be profits in it because there are
bubbles when the bubble bursts then the
circles down now most of the time the
penny stock sector the when the bubble
bursts
they typically drop almost 70% or 80% so
you're always looking for that huge area
to make a profit from but for short
settings I said if you don't have a
specific risk but if you don't have a
niche or a strategy you can use short
seller in the market because you'll
deserve money so for this one same thing
traded all over 60 million volume on
that day
and when people are buying it think
think like this way so when people
bought it the first day will tell people
on the their friends or whatever and
their friends join them then we'll
increase the volume on that and that
current day now when the stock goes
higher and higher what we are knowing it
and they don't know same thing the phone
until the stock the start started going
parabolic and people don't understand
it's a huge bubble so when the stock
shows first weakness people don't know
to stock their if they're nervous the
starts you're starting settings and if
they're sending start stars shorts are
recognized okay
the wick needs to start coming the
bubble is going to burst now since I had
a decent amount of market experience
I've seen this pattern so many times I
can easily I can easily recognize when
the witness is going to be and when is
what kind of price is really hard to
break so the more volume people trade
latest think about like this way so the
more of a so volume means how many
people how many shares are buying and
selling and if more shares are trading
on the current day more people are in
the stocks so there's less a today trade
around 1 million shares per day now
tomorrow through about 70 million shares
a day means there's the same every
single every single all of you have one
shares so there's going to be 70 million
people on this day people traded this
either either they lost money if they're
holding the stocks or they are short
sitting in the stocks so sure settings
are not many people short sitting on the
stock showing up showing short settings
on stock market and 90% of the people
are buying the stock because that's the
statistics of data of the stock market
so you know people are typically buying
this huge range on this big volume day
and the more shares been traded the more
bachelors will be in it
so when the star shows significant
weakness and you know there's so many
people stuck in this area and once they
start nervous they're gonna sail because
the suction cannot go any higher then
this huge volume huge volume day so when
you start recognize weakness I start
beginning short-selling
I write it this talk multiple times I
showed it around I think I should around
the dead top 46.8 I'll cover that six a
short around six to five and five to
four so I think on this specific trade
that made a hundred and twenty seven
thousand on this shorting into your
first red day and I think the total
profit will be adding the factors that
make sure it's six covered it shorter
600 cover at five shorten shooting that
5.3 covered at four so I think got the
total profit on this this ticker I think
I made over two three hundred thousand
dollars on this specific ticker in two
or three days
now the other thing this is a socket
rated in back in 2016 as you can say the
start goes 1 to 5 in 2 days same thing
there's always a balance in the stock
market and all the companies doesn't
grow that fat because it's not realistic
so whatever because in the pending style
sectors all the other companies they
need money for further investment for
the research so what they will do is to
draw money from investors that they
putting more shares into the supply so
if the supply will say supply is 10
million and the company is gonna put
another 1 million to dilute the shares
and once they do the shares because
those shares worth nothing so when they
dilute the shares then we can draw money
out front from the people who are
investing to stocks so for people
doesn't know how to how to trade these
stocks then they either draw the lose
money on short sellers the or they lose
money in from the company because they
died with the stocks on this one same
thing the well I would talk about
consolidation later in this area but the
consolidation for this current day will
be around $4 the most consolidating area
will be most shared shaded area so ever
if you are shooting from stranger if you
are shooting from spiked because people
like to chase or they like to buy when
the stock is green they like to buy when
the stock is going parabolic and people
are freaking now are panic they like to
panic under when people when the stock
is going red but it's the opposite in
the stock market for be with you when
you are buying when the stock is panic
you're shorting when the stock is going
green or a parabolic that's that's one
of the key but you have to control that
very well so there's a whole lot of
details in that I'm not gonna go very
details on that and on this
Tikaram made around this is really what
one of them a very biggest gains in 2016
made around $30,000 think it's in
current day so at that time I can
beginning to see there's a huge
potential in this kind of sectors I can
make hundreds of thousand dollars in
really short period of not a time so as
long as I can keep improving keep
improving my strategies I can do better
now let's talk about something that that
the strategy didn't work so same thing
the start went from four to twenty in a
matter of four or five days now it did
come back come back a little but same
thing you traded around 32 million
shares this day and somehow show some
kind of weakness and Rick and come back
to 16 or Tony so when your strategy
doesn't work and when you trade it so
many in the summer I want 54 out of 56
trades and when that confidence getting
to you you start become ultra confident
when you start become overconfident then
you are started going into huge you're
betting huge amount of money on this one
specific patterns so you don't want to
ever do that because as investor as a if
you have if you invest in do any kind of
business you don't ever go all-in into
one business you always have some kind
of backup back have found if you in case
something blows up and so so what I see
often for people that some of my
students master this technique and they
one name with all their money and the
start doesn't work then they take a huge
loss and that loss will be your entire
account so if you lose 12 or 20% 30%
then you lose two hundred thousand three
hundred thousand dollars in matter of
one day so risk management and invest
portion of your always try to invest
portion of your Inc account is very very
important to protect yourself from huge
financial loss now for this pattern I
lost thirty thousand but you just just
to clarify I didn't invest all my money
into this my invest about like ten
percent this is when the strategy
doesn't work you have to cut your losses
very very quickly because now if you
like if you have a huge size we have a
huge amount of money in this stock if
you don't cut your losses same thing as
a short sale you can lose more than
hundred percent can lose a thousand
percent so for this specific strategies
focus your risk management always always
think think about how much you're gonna
lose before how much you can gain people
go into stock market they're thinking
I'm gonna make a huge amount of money
like others making $100,000 a few
hundred thousand dollars in a day but
for an end of the at the end of the game
you have to think about your risk reward
how much are risking to make how much
they come if you are risking $10 to make
$1 that's not even worth it's not that's
not opportunities so this is all about
us how to increase your odds then how do
you how to increase your odds is the key
of the game now this is me from say
February 13th to April 13th that's two
months I have made over five hundred
thousand dollars in two months it's all
about that's all in this two months this
is one of my best performance month all
I can say is it's incredible and I
finally come out I can't
my emotions I do everything as the best
I controlled molasses really well and I
think my those two-month losses will I
think will only it's only $40,000 and my
gang is $500,000 so invest into stocks
focus on your losses instead of your
gains
now let's talk about the trading
strategy or my daddy skinning or my
habits so are you Stassi trade for daily
skinny and that's true if you guys may
know it's called das trader so typically
I only look at the top person gainers so
if you go into some kind platform you
want you there's gonna be a button says
top person gainer hope you wanna pull
that allowed to see what's the hot
stocks on the current day and there's
going to be specific criteria if you
have kind of some kind of strategies
that fits if the size trading specific
ball you'll see if the stock is trading
into specific price range so that's the
two that's the first two using a look at
and third day I'm looking at does the
stock fits my strategy this that doesn't
fit my strategy I automatically drop off
of my list because when the stock
doesn't fail your strategies if you want
to force trade that you don't know then
there turns out those money you are
going into the stock market to make
money not to lose money so if you if
you're always trying to feel you need to
tray you need to four straight think
about like that way
and now if I after I see the stuff fits
my strategies I'm going to check out the
yearly or multi-year support material
resistance if there's same saying any
people who bought a sock in two weeks
ago and something dropped I can use them
as a has merit of an inch to short sell
if the snot has multi-year support I can
use men I can use them for people to
come in start buying the stocks
so this is how I pick my strategies and
study habits first a very beginning I
build a huge spreadsheet a huge database
that tracks very specific strategies and
to to see what what is the best
performance and what kind of but it's
popular for a recent month and second I
combine my strategies las Tres can be
combined to make better performances so
same thing does the the strategy I
talked about the first red day and let's
try to talk about the very beginning the
word the first slide it's a it's called
bounce short and the why I made $120,000
that's called first birthday so if
somehow if you can combine the
strategies that creatures fit for each
other perfectly you can increase your
winning percentage and the third is
hanging from my mistakes
if I know if I made a mistakes I focus
on my mistakes I can I need to I need to
focus on that what did I do wrong and
valleys the learning process of trading
of even but of course as investing for
any kind of business if you fail you
stand where you need to stand up where
you thought you where you failed I also
have to adapt into the current market
environment sometimes well for the last
couple months
Bitcoin is very very hot and in the back
in 2008 or 2010 the technology stocks
are really really hot now the trade war
started going around and the Chinese
stocks are going up to you
so always focus focus on what kind of
sector is hot and when you can't
recognize that momentum if you can get
into you fear the first person getting
to it then you can make a huge profit
from no front it weighted percentages so
same time talk about combining
strategies and special sheets those are
all factors to increase your winning
percentage always track your winning
percentage you will give first when
going to a trade will give you a huge
confidence boost before we get into a
trade so it's all about confidence and
that also cannot be overconfident when
you feel you're already confident you're
going too much so try to control your
investment or portion you're very messy
so also have to understand the two side
of people in the market so people are
some people are going along in the socks
some people are shorting the stocks
you're always going to stand on the
right side on the most people side so if
most people are selling the stock you
want to draw on a short side most people
are buying this like your own joint on
the long side and always follow where
the big money is because sometimes when
the trade doesn't work you have to see
what you do wrong and there's gonna be
some kind of factors you understand you
just wrong about people are where people
are going on people going short so let
me now let me give you examples about
this specific stocks so same thing our
bunch were just talking from 0.5 to $3
and when the stock come backs against it
as you can see this 2.5 act at the
resistance and can you came back down
and start going off this going up over
this 2.5 at that point you have to cut
your losses because as you can see stuff
went over with your 4 so you ferry
shorting from 2.5 you're you are losing
60% 70% of your accounts so that you
have to be really really careful about
and when the stock is showing weakness
and at that time if you if you took a
loss same thing as other as average
people or psychology if you took a loss
in the market you will feel some kind of
like you would I won't say a frustrated
about your losses and the next thing you
want to do is I want to make my I want
to make my losses back now when you try
to have that calm mindset
I start trading training training and
training something that you don't know
that you and the next thing you can in
the next thing you come back your
account you realize you lost 50 percent
your account so that I have to be really
careful sometimes strategy doesn't work
cut your losses and focus on or take a
day off and the next day come back fresh
focus on still focusing on strategy
because when the stretch doesn't work it
just your focus on it's a it's an arts
problem if you are one in 70 percent of
the time there's gonna be that 30
percent happen somehow so don't take it
too much
don't forget don't take it too much
personally just a heart problem so for
the risk management for every single
trade first you have to have a maximum
loss second you have to manage your
positions so for let's say maximum loss
and for if you're a talent only $10,000
your your Maximus can now be over a
thousand dollars on one trade because
you feel because if you take a loss of
$5,000 it's really hard to come back
over fifty and fifty percent fifty
percent of your account so so too you
have to manage the maximum loss manager
maximum loss manager position size and
your position size has to be equal to
your maximum loss that lets me give you
example if you are buying stock at two
dollars you're risking 1.8 now you're
risking 20 cents so if that 20 cents
breaks your losses so you're all of the
stocks and if your maximum loss is let's
say it's a $1000 so you're using zero
point zero point two times a thousand
now a thousand divided by 0.2 yeah I
think and I think that's right so you
are you are buying 20,000 shares risking
zero point two now you're buying ten
dollars
zero point no five done share the risk
in zero point if sorry
so that's so your maximum loss has to be
equal your your position size you cannot
be seen you can so different price range
you can have different position size and
you can play the guessing guessing games
because if you size in too much into
that consolidate so the consolidating
star basically looks like a straight
line so 50 50 50 50 percent chance if
the stuff breaks down the stocks go and
go that go that way if the style breaks
out and starts gonna go that way so now
if you're shorting in the fair Shooting
more by in the middle you're risking of
repetitions to go up going up take your
chances going down now your you don't
have a good odds of winning so if you're
get lucky your short sale then you make
a huge profit
what happens if you it's the other 50%
you do 60% on your account so always
focus on the odds before going to trade
think about how much we can wait what's
your winning percentage on these
specific strategies then star manage
your positions now the stock histories
this is really important as I said
before our trade your stocks
does the stock has a habit if the stock
in the previous two three years he
spikes alive and spikes I would say two
three days now the stuff has the habit
you spiked two or three days so if the
stock specs on the first day you can buy
and you're expecting this lets you spike
in the second day stock has habit people
look at the stock history to judge the
stock habit then based on the stock
habit you can make your judgment so down
what kind of sector it it it is if
typically these couple sectors are
really hot in the stock market like
biotechs
right now it's become a couple months
ago its Bitcoin related stocks missed I
can go from two to one fifteen two days
and what does the stock behave
and so if the stock behaves always
fairly stone spikes then it's gonna fare
all its other specs every single time
now if the start decided to go multi-day
or it's like a multi-day runners or
rounds first day second day third day
and fourth day thing you want to
expecting is to stock going
boaty days instead of going up one day
and start going down now I'll go over
something you need to be avoid that when
you are trading first you don't want to
be very very emotional not same thing if
you take a loss and you're feeling
frustrated take a day off and come back
fresh tomorrow and don't be
overconfident because you'd be
overconfident in your style in a cubic
and if you feel missing now basically we
are started making money and says I want
to join this opportunities every single
day I don't wanna miss every single
opportunities and if you have that kind
of mentality you start losing money
trust me then avoid shortening on the
first screen day I typically when I'm
gonna stock his spike on the first
screen day he has really really low are
two drawbacks down so not just the
statistics try to over it as much as
possible and when you are shooting into
a stat under 2 million flow 2 million
it's considered to be really low flow so
if you have a really low supply and high
demand and people screw up keep bidding
their price and start stacking them so
it's first it's really hard for you to
get out of that positions and also this
bag so fast you when you cut your losses
you already losing 30 percent of your
account so if you're not really familiar
about the sectors about the stocks then
don't trade it and also when you don't
have a risk level or don't have a
resistance don't treat it and for stock
earnings lots of people like to talk
about like Tesla winnings Tesla
Tesla's earnings career earnings or
yearly earnings Tesla's or Amazon's
whatever big company is you're guessing
they don't know how they're gonna be so
if you're trying to purchase it before
the earnings or shortly before earnings
violence comes out opposite way to 50 50
percent chance so same thing avoid the
guessing games now when you are also
adding two losers four people four
people are already got into your
position so if you're losing money can
see you around if you can see your
unrealized start getting bigger and
bigger
then it says I don't believe this I
think the stars can come back down start
adding into my positions then your
position gets bigger and bigger and next
thing and you realize your position is
so big you can it's out of control and
you can not get out because when once
you get out you lose 60% over the whole
entire account now since you have that
frustrating directors loss keep going
then you lose everything so try to not
add in two losers
I stopped trading percentage same thing
this is one of the one of the Vedas that
I track on my spreadsheets so stop
feeling percentage if if it's one
strategies if there's one strategies
that I'm shorting into a spike and you
fades off before the market closed now
they say the first day you closed around
here now the second not the second day
well next next time the pattern happens
again it fades out right here so I've
tracked so many data of this failing
percentage I can know the exactly the
average failing percentage is so the
next time I use this average every
single time I use is average to get out
of my position so I can take my games I
know where I'm gonna take my profits
from now every single time which reaches
this average I take at least 30% of my
positions now if the stock we're gonna
draw further I'm gonna keep writing my
profits if stock comebacks up again then
I'm still gonna take my profits so that
tracking data will guide
how to take my profits now how to
recognize strengths pullback or weakness
for the first green day same thing don't
show in the first window as I said
because the stock is really hard to no
chance to come back down so when they
pull back when they shows women are
setting our pan whatever panic is you
recognize it's a pullback it's not a
weakness because the stock head can
potential go up again because sometimes
flow rotate sometimes people the new
buyers comes in so first green day if
it's a showing weakness it's a pull back
it's not it's not weakness and first red
day now the stock round ran the moti day
rent moti days and shows the first red
day and that's a weakness that's another
pullback so recognize the recognize
correctly about Pope acts and weakness
is really really important because you
know when you're gonna take it positions
either go long or go short
they say moti day and their extensions
now momentum shift so this is where the
short income comes from when the style
runs multi days is very overextended and
shooting the first red day and that's
that's where we call the moment a shift
once the once the entire style he start
shifting Momentum's will be downtrend
even full of at least couple days so we
can write that banner ending for a
potential 20 to 30 percent profits
basting and consolidations this is
really tough but so when the stock is
basing I'm gonna keep it simple so when
the stock is basing its counsel is going
up a straight line and consolidation
it's the same thing going out to three
lines taking a technical analysis when
stock breaks this consolidation is
corporate Cal breaks down cover car
they'll break down when the stock is
having really good news then the stock
has abolished factors
now we're gonna stuck it but the stock
is breaking down that means people who
believe this is a bullish factors
they're they're selling the stocks and
sure sir how does it because people
recognize as a bullish factor but turns
out become a bearish factors so what it
will do is instant shouting so the
setting will be harder than usual the
ration will be hard that's the part you
can recognize if the factors on your
favor so if the bullish factor reverses
then increase the bearish factor odds
now if the bearish factors reverses it
turns out to be a bullish factors all
right
that's the whole thing about my speech
thank you very much and I hope

lots of guys team doctor so today we're
going to talk about the pen strategy
step by step and I found this strategy
from 2017 so two years ago it's been
working out really well and especially
for beginners so before I go into this
video make sure to click the like button
and subscribe and also our conference is
coming up in a 28 - meant at 30th so
make sure to grab your ticket on the
last month on sale let's get into this
video alright let's get into the
strategy so first of all you want to
look at the accurate roll and overall
volume the overall volume and flow
correlation will tell you how much
demand as the stock has on today now
let's look at the intraday Edward flow
on cos ap Co CP flow is around 17 point
63 million dollar volume will be 74
million so when you want to use how much
demand does it really has you want to
use doctrine volume divided by the
overall flow will be how many times does
that follow already rotated now three to
five times considered a good buy
indicators for a stock back 0cp today
now seventy four point five divided by
17 will be 5 so lens right about you
know to buy indicator area now CEO CP is
considered to be a good buy today now
the question is when do you want to dip
buy and where you want to get by so
let's look at Co CP on the first screen
10 second Green Day overall comparison
you want to look at the volume first
volume on the first green day will be 80
million second green there will be 60
million and we want to look at the
Pareto chart this one point $5 area
becomes the support when it gaps up in
the second Green Day so when the stock
decides to pull back into this 80
million support you will be a potential
dip by because the stock is green now we
are risking green to red first of all
for going to read is a decent indicator
for you to buy and second indicator will
be you are buying into the first green
day support which will be around 1.5 so
going to read it will be 1 by indicator
buying to the support out 1.5 will be
the second buy indicator so when the
stock decides to reverse it's impossible
to break that 80 minute support only
with 74 million bond because the issuer
divine was around 80 million so number
one indicator is going to look at will
be you only use the overall volume
divided with a flow to calculate how
many times did that stock wrote
today if it lands around three to five
times will be considered very polish the
second criteria in there will be you can
use green to read and also you can use
the first green day support at one point
five dollar area to get a decent reward
from going long so the last criteria
will be something that I want you to
avoid don't try to learn something that
a company is desperate for cash and
you're trying to long a ticker that's
already on the fourth or fifth day on
the run like GM px this is one of the
ticker you need to avoid because the
stock oh it's already become a multi-day
runner for the past five or six days if
you're trying to log into this breakout
and you will be able to get offering on
your positions and it will be instant
down about fifty percent from your
original investment second thing I want
you to oh boy will be massive flow
rotations if the flow is only about 1
million and two million and the flow is
rotating about 10 to 15 times on that
day it will be very difficult to really
go on that because since it's a low flow
majority low flow can be controlled by
market makers and once it's controlled
and getting SSR the stock can be very
easily dumped in one candle especially
in the afternoon so when I'm trying to
go along I'll say try to find the time
in before 1 p.m.
don't try to go long after 2 p.m. always
give yourself about several indicators
that you can go along with and always
convince yourself that you have several
factors that could lean towards to make
you get more winning percentage younger
loans so in this case what I have on
CoAP
is I can dip by a 1.5 that'll be deep
buying from support so that's the first
polish factor I can use second I can use
what we going to read third thing I can
use will be it's only on the second day
round it's not on the fourth or fifth
round
so the start still has rooms to go and
it's likely to get pop tomorrow since
you finish really strong if you see a
stock finish really strong close to day
high after a bearish morning panic it's
likely to gap up on the following day
that'll be all the criterias for this
pattern and always make sure calculate
the flow rotations make sure do not size
in on those micro flow because those can
be easily controlled never chase into a
strength
only the
to support that would be the best bet to
grow your small account and at the end
of this video thank you very much and
I'll see you guys in the next one

what's up guys doing doctor so today is
a very important day I just got my
counseling and some verified by
certified CPA from Bahamas and I did
post this on Twitter and I didn't get a
lot of positivity and some negativity as
well so today I'm dressed negative and
so today I'm going to address and answer
some questions about all those
negativities and it's get into it before
I get into this already statements and a
lot of people are having questions like
where do I start
well how do I really trust a girl how do
I really trust this guy before you wanna
subscribe or buying somebody's courses
make sure they have like a correct were
really good track record and make sure
they show you his performances and he
showed you the odds by statistics that
this pattern will work before buying
somebody's or any type of courses make
sure that you do your own research and
trust your own judgments make sure to
hit the like button and subscribe
there's gonna be more content to come
into the future so this is my first step
to getting audited by other CPA firms
I'm not very familiar with all the
relationship between a trader and the
firm so this is one of my Alex a very
important step to get into all those
audited forums as well and I did contact
some bigger firms like PwC Detroit and
all those people that they only work for
companies that is over 100 million so if
they do like the auditing services for a
per year and it will cost anywhere
between next 300,000 to 350,000 my track
records or get verified by Bahamas
because my trading account is from
Bahamas I do have other trading accounts
and I'm trying to give them verified as
well the first question I get from
people are well you did an interview
with other people before you never had
some Redmont or never hand cream month
it's because I you have a multiple
accounts
[Music]
I don't only just have one we're are
short sellers you need a multiple
account to be able to find shares too
short sometimes you are trading miss a
first birthday you're looking for a
swing trade then you are expecting to
hold shares for a couple days that also
means you don't want to find a broker
that give you really good overnight fees
now sometimes trade 0 they charge times
70 so for overnight that means if you
are borough fees 1000 holding overnight
will be cost 7,000 if you aren't
expecting a holding about let's say 2 or
3 days there's going to be turned into
something 20,000 30,000 that will
straight over 1 all your profits and in
this case you having a broker like Cobra
they charge much less overnight fees
having your broker in speech writer or
Centrepointe they are charged much less
fees compared to 3 0 so if I were
looking for like an intraday trade then
tracer will be the best for like
shorting availabilities that's the
reason why I have multiple brokers this
is my first step getting into the
auditing so I just verified the Fraser
performances and other people are start
already hating on oh you didn't really
verify either track record you say you
didn't have a read month in 2018 and you
said you can't make about 2 or 3 million
dollars per year this account is that
specifically started with a really low
amount of money that means my starting
positions or starting account size would
be 25,000 now it took me about 19 months
to grow this 25,000 to $1,000,000
well gross profit will be one point two
million dollars amongst all the fees and
stuff like that it's probably anywhere
between like 900 K to a million dollars
so this is the first thing I want to
show people that I turned 25 thousand
into 900 thousand to 1 million dollars
and there's gonna be more track record
will be verified it just by having a
bigger accounts because I build my
bigger accounts into other brokers not
just in trade 0 so there'll be more
verified account statements auditing
Tommy
so just stay tuned if you have any
questions about this auditing technical
comment below I can try to answer
questions as best as I can now it's
going to some of the questions that
people left in the last video about the
2018 tested spirit account statements so
right here the most frequent questions I
get is well Stephen I understand that
you started with a 25,000 and you have
325 thousand accounts now 225 thousand
is considered as a backup the April and
May I lost in between 55,000 plus the
four thousand and that's in between like
sixty thousand so I have 10k left the
reason why I split counts into multiple
parts is because when you are tracking
on statistics when you are tracking a
pattern there's always a woody
percentage let's say a pattern has about
80 percent money per inch and there's
about 20 percent losing percentage as
well there is a chance that you can lose
ten times or a hundred times in a row
even though your winning percentage is
eighty percent so that means we can let
him at 20% and times in a row in April
May and June I did land into all of
those type of patterns now I did have
some ones that you had some losses in
June I've reemerged my risk and so the
losses will be much smaller then still
focus on the same pattern and as you can
see the pattern worked out really well
I started generating like 50,000 or
close to 50,000 in June almost 50,000 in
July 175,000 in August Tokoloshe on
September about 80,000 and October and
the Murga and December worked out really
good
as I said for this specific trader
accounts it's not my fault buying power
account that means it's not released to
the full potential because I'm a
relatively smaller account compared to
the bigger account that I have for
auditing the purposes for this specific
account statements is to show you it's
possible to turn you can save twenty
five thousand into six hundred thirty
thousand in gross profit or you can see
turning seventy five thousand because
there's 225 thousand backup account into
six hundred thirty thousand in gross
profit and five hundred fifty thousand
in net profit and a lot of people are
asking well you fell short
there's going to be fees involved as
well and I did pulled out all the please
and plus them together there is an
answering no statements I chose that so
we have to go into like each mount
statements to find your bow fees and add
them up together so overall on 2018 will
be around fifty thousand so the net net
profit after manage the fees - the
barrel fees
- everything the net profit that comes
out will be five hundred thousand in
2018 so basically I used 75 thousand
split into three accounts turning into
five hundred thousand by the end of the
year only cost about eight months
hopefully that makes sense so as you can
see in 2019 the overall profit got much
bigger and the losses got bigger as well
I only had about three months so other
amount are green in specifically March
you can see there's at negative one
hundred forty-three thousand now there's
a lot of stuff going into where there is
like boxing positions with other
accounts but in March I did trade a lot
of shares back and forth absolutely
March I couldn't really tell if I was in
green but we read but overall I think in
March I don't think I lost money by
October the net profit will be five
hundred fifty thousand thirty seven or -
2018 the performances using 2019
compared with 2018 2018 was a little bit
better I think 2019 was little bit
sloppier because of that March I boxed
the positions so the net profit I would
say is anywhere between like six hundred
to six hundred twenty thousand on 2019 I
think the ball fields anywhere between
50,000 to 75,000 the overall net profit
between
2018 and 2019 is around 1 million
dollars this is the first step to give
me my performances to verify I'm trying
to be as transparent as possible so that
be the end of the video for any
questions make sure leave a comment

SOURCE VIDEO: My thoughts on making 800k in 6 month [-DO08yGO3BI].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
sup guys doing duck sir I've been
getting a lot of questions and a lot of
people wants me to do a couple of months
a monthly performance I have made around
800,000 in about four months and as you
can see my trades they're all verified
so none of those are fake or anything
and I want to keep my start process on
all my begins and and some my losses and
give you guys a brief idea how to really
day trade and why you need to stay away
so let's get started with my biggest
scan on grn and for most of the stocks
typically they don't go over three
hundred percent one five hundred percent
in a couple of days now if you think is
it really it's a really good business
and journey takes them years to go up
five years five hundred percent or maybe
even a thousand percent but it takes
time so when those option happens in a
couple of days there is going to be some
kind of pullback now how hard it will
pull back you really depends on the
company's fundamentals so we have to
know how much money does this company
make what's your long-term investments
were their short-term investments was
their lives or assets basically you have
DT judge
where's what's the company positions
right now and does it worth as much now
that's all the fundamental stuff but
when you are but you know when the stock
is going up five hundred percent in
couple days there's then and most of the
stock I'm trading it will be penny
stocks penny stocks is stuck on your $5
so when they pull back they generally
pull back 70% sometimes even 100% so the
only thing you need to recognize is
where's the downtrend momentum where
it's going to be and to judge where it's
going to be that texmarq extreme
and also takes maximum practice and
studying so here I wanna go over it with
my injuries my exit and I think my entry
was 520 and that covered around $4 ish I
didn't do you perfect and you went down
all the way to 350 but I did take my
gains and I think that's that was my
second try my first trial was shorting
into the sixth 650 area and they covered
in 2005 50 and now I showed it into
second day because into the morning push
and turns on there's a negative
streaking awful article came out and
first read it typically doesn't drop
that much but I got little lucky so it
turns out to be a 50,000 gain becomes
$120,000 again and that is my biggest
game of the year I love this trade and
this trade was married perfectly and my
execution I think was all right I didn't
cut the dead part I didn't cut the dead
top by a tick but I took most of the
chunk of this trade so I thought process
and my experience I need to give you
ears sometimes you just don't need to
guess the top you do need to guess the
bottom now as long as you can recognize
the trend you can most likely take most
chunk up the trade and make a decent
game from it and on T and X this is
another thing I want to talk about
because when the stock is trading say
I'm right here is this the volume right
here it's the stock price to stop going
from 4 to 13 and 7 million volume now
this stock went from 5 to 12 in 7 medium
volume now volume means how many shares
traded per day and when stock trading on
the same volume all right same thing
same type of price range then the
typically happens
repeat the same thing so the stock
dropped from 12 to 7 now I'm expecting
this time stops draw from 12 to 7 again
so I took most chunk of this trade I
think I did shortly around I think was
11 or 1080 cover into the high seven or
low eight
that was my $80,000 yen so from this
trade its history tends to repeat itself
and when they're trading the same
criteria or same identical places they
most likely to going to repeat itself
and they when they drop their most
likely to repeated itself so you can
learn from the first time and make
action on the second time so you know
how far he's gonna drop try and let's
try it out in the second time now that's
exactly my style process that was my
$80,000 again and the grm was my
$120,000 again think there's another one
I think was arkady a arkady and DX are
so arkady and the XR their attempt at a
place so when the start when the
Weinstock is Viking people tends to find
an error same same industry stock to buy
as well so the stock went from 30 to 65
and I did short it into this balance and
it's wind a little bit
didn't have enough patience but cover
into the into the 30s and that was my
$60,000 game on the XR at they
recognized in my Winton and I didn't
catch the tie pollen I didn't catch the
dead top but it took the most chunk of
the trade so the key is to recognize
worst momentum and if you see that
history mister chart history you can use
that as your guidance to make your
and again there is gonna repeat herself
or a scratch its gonna trade a
completely different volume or he breaks
the previous habits now when the stock
is breaking its have completely
different criteria or completely
different situation than when they
starting breaking the stop repeating the
history by itself that's where you me to
a cairo losses so sometimes I do it well
sometimes I don't but in this game you
have to stay disciplined when the stock
is making some weird actions or or the
history doesn't repeat itself anymore
when you see it cut your losses
immediately because this game all you
need to do is to control your risk and
recognize momentum and that's how you
make two hundred thousand amount I think
my monthly performance was I think I
made around six hundred thousand dollars
in March and that did have a ninety two
thousand losses so as well as long as
you're wearing are not bigger in your
losses we were doing completely fine
because you know every trade it cannot
be it Oracle to know exactly what's
gonna happen but studying and practice
and market experience will give you a
good idea to cashing those good trades
and that's where you need to be so those
are my biggest month of my career and
they're really happy I did it I just
want to share my experience because cos
people asked for it and what do I feel I
don't really feel about how much money I
make it's it's all about adapting into
again and recognize where you need to be
I think that's for the video today and
the today I do I also want to go over
some place that happened today ABG are
think I did a overextended Kapton
pattern and he worked out perfectly
and I do call on my trade see my chat
room and I I will tell the Chapman Wendy
like when did I close the trade I think
everybody made money on maybe gr there's
some losses that I want to talk about
too nobody's perfect
and I did shorted around I think was 310
and covered to 3:30 when this hired
starting breaking out and turns out to
be a desk job with her into the
afternoon and because when this 315
cracked idea really you want to chase
because the stocks not to up that much
and now I'm regretting it but most of
the time you're going to mix trades and
it's gonna be that one ticker you're
going to miss it and you're gonna feel
that oh I miss this trade I want to make
my stock market owns me money and I want
to make it back but if you think like
that you're you're getting emotional
when emotional involving your trades and
you start losing money and you get more
emotional and start using more money so
the more emotional you are the Romney no
more money will lose so in this game try
to be rational and if you miss a train
just just miss it it's not it's not a
big deal there's the opportunity comes
every single day but yeah that's all my
thought process for the day and a couple
of multi performance now if you're
interested to chat room I'll put a link
below underneath my youtube video and
thank you very much guys have a great
day

hello guys davendux here welcome to this
youtube videos and today we're going to
go through some of the recaps
that i want to talk about since the
market has picked up its volume for the
last
week or so so in total i've made 400 000
between
a btx and prpo both of them traded the
extreme volume
like usual that we had in the last five
months
so overall i haven't been actively
traded for
almost two months so i have made some
mistakes
here and there i want to talk about them
and hopefully
you and me can both learn from my
mistakes we will get better at trading
and let's get into the recaps
so first sticker i want to talk about
will be gme i have been swinging this
from the 180s since there's massive
amount of resistance around 200
so well not much going on this one
because since we have nothing to trade
it's better to keep a decent swing
positions to
keep generating your income but other
than that nothing much going on for the
last two months
so for this week specifically i
traded the prpo uh shorted anywhere
between
seven to seven thirty i think my entry
was
right there and i swim it all the way
till i think was 580
since i saw there was a massive
perk around 144 i wasn't very
comfortable holding the shorts
because well first of all stock didn't
really have a solid consolidations
for me to risk off second my entry
wasn't very good
because my risk will be around 9
18 which is a massive risk so
i'm risking two dollars to make another
potentially two dollars so the risk
ratio is around one to one
and that makes me really uncomfortable
also this is a not a normal pattern
because it's not a gap offshore it's a
multi-day owner and they fade on the
second day
when a ticker involved those two
conditions normally they don't really
have a very good winning percentage
especially on the short inside
and also you can see that there is a
massive support around four
so the stock is having trouble
uh cracking that 513 area is because
that people tends to buy
above support so normally it's anywhere
between 10
to 20 and uh it's it's testing that
support and bouncing from that support
three to four times so um by the end of
the day i'm
trying to take my profits not going to
be greedy because this is where
uh stock can come back and go against
you in the next day
so um covered prpo early and faded
all the way back to four um into the
support
so right about here and it's bouncing
from the support now
didn't really trade this one perfectly
but next time i'll try to hold a little
bit longer at least
probably hold one third of my positions
into the next day
all right the next one i want to talk
about will be btx
now this one was a little bit tricky and
i was patient enough to catch the back
side but not patient enough to
hold all the way until where i wanted
one of the reasons why i didn't hold
this one for very long since my entry
was around 70
i think my entry is around 68 to 70
area and you can see that there is a
massive amount of support
formed around april 30th so if you look
at the
overall chart now you can see it traded
about 50 million volume on that day so
there is a 15 million volume of 40
stock formed as a solid support so when
i'm shooting that 68
you kind of want to cover above the
support right in that specific day i
took my first cover around 52
yeah 52 right here then cover the rest
around 58 because
it's right at the support so i'm not
very confident that the stock will
keep fading even though it's on the back
side but there's way too much
support for me to watch in the stock for
the entire day
so btx same thing as the prpo both of
them faded through the support
especially btx prp will fit it right at
the support
so for those two takers i'll be always
recommend you guys
even though you see these type of
tickers that they fade much
further than you think or you want to be
safe by trying to cover your positions
before the support
whenever there is a dense support in the
stock didn't really run
far enough from the support and there's
not enough risk of war for the
shortening to
i would recommend cover right before the
support because it's way too dangerous
to hold at the support and
whenever there is a perk you will be
regretting that you should cover much
earlier
so that will be all the tickers on talk
about btx and rhe and those are
specifically microflow
so those are normally very difficult to
trading especially when they trade the
mass amount of volume
so in here i'm not going to go over too
much about them just be careful that
when they're under fifteen dollars
they're much easier to squeeze when the
stock is going
up to eighty dollars so that'll be end
of this recap hopefully you guys learned
something and uh
be careful with your shoulder positions
and long positions because at the
beginning
of the hot market there is normally a
massive squeeze
or the stock phase 75 percent in one day
so tons of risk involved make sure to
track your data
and be patient and i will see you guys
in the next video

then there's another ticker btct which I
made a big mistake on uh shorting into
the premarket I thought the previous day
12 120 million shares traded into the
consolidation was sufficient enough to
block the spike from breaking the $12
area of course you can see the ticker
spent about 5 million shares breaking
through the $12 area and btct was also
related to bitcoin so one lesson to be
learned that do not short into a ticker
that's related to1 to2 trillion Market

hello guys Damien here I will be holding
a conference in late February and I will
be giving out the strategies that made
me over eight figures between 2020 to
2022 and also some updates about the
strategies that I created back in 2018
to 2019. of course the market condition
has changed and also I will be giving
out a discount for Trader's Edge which
is the upcoming new course there's only
going to be discount for this conference
specifically and if you're interested
make sure to join the conference and
it's going to be a very interesting time
to learn about strategies that's going
to play out in a slow market and also we
are going to review when the market
comes back just like 2021
[Music]
I knew of ducks before just YouTube
videos and you know my sister has been
trading stocks for well over 12 years
and she knew about him so once I saw him
do his guest speaking with at Triforce
conference I was like wow this stuff
makes sense you know it'd be something
that I would approach if I were to you
know like know that much about the
stocks and build my own pattern types of
things I like Steven because I'm an
engineer myself so I have the same
like-minded with him I like how
transparent he is he has
backed all his strategies up with data
statistical data and you know he with
the freedom challenge which I'm a part
of he lines out you know like all his
different patterns all the tickers that
he trades with it and you could
essentially like you know look at each
one and see the strategy you play it
over and over and he has like winning
percentages on each one and it's been
verified very transparent I think that
you know like with especially new
Traders I think you're in a prime spot
to actually trade for reasons that he
teaches you the right way to trade
instead of trading 10 times over and
you're trading on indicators and stuff
like that and you know finding the sum
of your trades this is
concrete strategies that play out you
know maybe like a few times a week and
you really size in hard when it happens
and make profits that way instead of
trading all the time everything's backed
up with Statistics you don't need
necessarily years of experience in order
to get fluency behind it you can spend a
d like a chunk of your time a healthy
chunk of your time understanding the
content reviewing it over and over until
you gain that fluency and then from

on top of YouTube Stephen ducks here so
today I'm gonna talk about my 2020 goals
so first as a trader if you know how the
industry works typically day trading
makes that I purchase the mounting which
is very fast short return and you make
about no twenty thousand thirty thousand
a day if I sometimes you don't really
make a trade at all
[Music]
so for that I think it's considered as
aggressive income now in Tony Tony I'm
looking for in a more passive income so
I just got into real estate I don't
really know how it works but still
trying to learn more I'm gonna be honest
about it and different regions do have
different our live which is the return
of an investment now most of investment
in return will be anywhere between a 10%
to 12% if you find a good property of it
I'm trying to get into this real estate
game if you guys have any suggestions
and open to any type of advice to start
as a beginner
but I'm also learning that I can use
loans as a revenge which is the same
concept to using leverage in the stock
market I know the losing leverage in the
market will be very very dangerous is
because you are betting bigger and your
risk will be bigger if it goes to
opposite ends to go very wrong about it
now in real estate it's pretty much a
very steady income can really see the
history of the behavior of how much it
trying to return on these specific
properties and you can use that
basically leverage and buy more
properties in the future so for example
if you have about $1,000,000 worth of
properties and you can put 15 20% down
so that's about 200k being gone you
still have 800 K left you can use our
800 K to purchase more properties put in
15-20 percent down so if you have 1
minute our cash flow as my understanding
you can leverage about you know to the 4
depends on you know how your credit
score is once you leverage that money
you can buy multiple properties to
increase the percentage of a returned by
each properties but you have to pay back
the interest and dealing with tenants
and hire a real estate agent help you to
deal with all those documents and
sometimes it can manage your tenants as
well so it will be a lot of headache but
if you know how it really works I think
it could be a really good passive income
as my understanding of it and you don't
have to give that much time about as
well number 2 at the same thing we all
are looking to improve from our training
performances from me I think you can
learn something about how to really
improve your trading performances every
time after I finish a year I will go
back into every single month and find
the monthly statements to really pull
out the trades every single trade that
and made a huge mistake song doesn't
matter how much loss you taking astray
is you need to figure it out why did you
take this trade and how can you be able
to avoid in the future sometimes when
I'm taking random trades and that take
20 K 10 K losses and I don't really know
why I did this trade is because when do
I have FOMO or what is going on if you
figure out the trade you are doing more
formal trade and you can add the formal
trade together you will be a huge number
really
a few moments later do you know where am
I in this case that I will polar all the
mistakes that was same type of mistakes
and add them together so eventually I
will be able to see those two sheets and
let's say fear of missing out I lost 100
K just making random trade then I'll
start 200 K because when you're trying
to learn to improve your trading
performances you need to eliminate every
single small mistake as well because
after a year all those 1 to 20 30
mistakes they add them together and
what's your biggest profit and how can
you be able to make more profit out of
it so last thing I want to do is nobody
have been written down before is a
specific AEI system platform that could
recognize patterns all of all stocks
that was being traded on that day and
this is like one of the new ideas I want
to do and let me know if you guys have
any suggestion about it I think it would
be a really good idea just for beginners
to really try it out how the pattern
works and why they work at the beginning
of from 2014 to 2015 I don't have that
much knowledge about stock market and
I'd learned up whole buncha patterns and
when the market opens I don't know which
one to look for if a platform can filter
it out you know that specific indicator
you look for then it could be much
easier to process and to help you make
better trade let's say on top person
generally look for there's about 20 30
tickers that can be potentially traded I
had to go back into all those 30 tickers
and try to pull out every single and now
you're retired to find out which ones
overextended and the bonds supposed to
be increasing while the first ready
appears consistent increasing at least
10% per day consistent vow increasing
10% a day and have to go into those 30
tickers and look for every single one of
them it takes about know 30 minutes to
go over that as a beginner because I
don't know what I'm doing and I'm not
very familiar with the pattern you will
take a whole lot of time to really find
the one that fits me you know the
so once I find the correct criteria and
the pattern is already finished I
couldn't really make me any profits
outlet because it'd take too much time
to figure it out which one works if
which one doesn't
I think this pattern will be useful for
you know beginners or people who are
trading learning couple month or a
couple years and you can develop your
own strategy and put into the property
to help you look for some type of stuff
like that or you can just build your
pattern into the platform let's say
first red day or person gap down now
today I'm going to look for in our first
reading gap down I would have the
platform use those criteria to filter
out all the stocks out there in a sec or
numeric exchange they will tell you okay
and those two our first writer tells you
those two hours in gap down so be very
very easy for me to know fast react if
there's a couple fast bikes and we'll be
able to recognize a pattern much faster
compared to you know other retail trader
out there and that could give me a
better risk reward just by and finding
pattern faster than them so that is one
of the AR system slash platform when a
developer you have any suggestions or
advice any me know and we're also
launching a conference during march 28th
29th and 30th in new york manhattan so
if you're interested if you're a
beginner or you know you're trading for
a few years it would be really good for
you to really learn about trading
environment and watch me live trade and
a lot of people are asking me Stephen
please do a lot of trading
I do a lot of trade all the time I do I
laughter every single pretty much every
single day from my student and also I
did a lot of trade that made twenty six
thousand I think twenty four twenty six
thousand in front of all the audience
out there in a conference last time and
in addition we're also giving out free
webinar for potential laughter that's
what if you can find one on a specific
day if you want to really watch me live
trade them sign up in email with us and
we'll send you a specific day we can
live trade man can come to the
conference and we'll be giving out now
new adjusted patterns and new things for
you to learn and what to look for you
know in 2020 2021
so yeah I'll be end of the video so
thank you very much and hopefully you
have a goal for yourself for 2020
let's stay motivated and let's stay
let's stay in what we did it right
motive let's stay motivated and I'll see
you guys next video

people have known me that have turned
twenty seven thousand into 2.4 million
dollars in two years hello my name is
Steven Ducks I'm 22 years old people
have known me that 27 thousand into 2.4
million dollars in two years through
consistent patterning in the stock
market every single one of my trades are
verified i've personally reached my own
goal to reach financial independence i
[Music]
was the product of the whole internet
get-rich-quick themes life was not
easier then i was relying on my parents
for a really tight budget and they don't
want to do that anymore the only way i
could comprehend is to get wealth first
i spent so much with my lunch money on
all those internet schemes the cruelty
of reality lies in front of me they do
not work bitterness is blocking my
vision and pushing me forward
[Music]
people say the stop front is random for
me it is at the beginning that have
tried many many times kiss my own
strategies to figure out my own way to
become profitable in the stock market it
took me many many hours to figure out
what works and what doesn't
the key to deal with the stock market is
human psychology you have to figure it
out what people are thinking to be able
to counter strategy them and that's
where you stand now of almost all the
traders because as statistics for
showing in the stock market ninety
percent of people lose money only ten
percent people can profit from them
through consistent practice in stock
market my two-year moonray is around
eighty five to seventy five percent that
do you lose sometimes because stock
market you have to play by the odds
nothing is 100% win rate there are some
scenarios you have to practice taking
your Lance's and that is the key to be
successful in the stock market there is
a lot of strategies in stock market and
you can find a whole lot of proven
method all over the internet and the way
to figure it out if they are fake or not
is to testing their strategies put them
on spreadsheets and to figure out what
is the total winning percentage through
massive samples that's how science works
that's how any of the system works to
actually put the experiment on those
strategies to see whether they work or
not I've created my own guide that
includes a load my strategies that have
average of 85 percent win rate in a
stock market as long as you practice
them good I think that is a cookbook to
lead you on to the right way to a stock
market
if you don't believe me I have all my
trades recorded you know data format
that includes all of my a strategies to
show what's the winning percentage of
the individual strategies and a total
average memory of all those strategies
are around 75% to 85% if you ask me what
is the hardest and have ever encountered
in trading career it is my passion to
dealing with the market and keep pushing
me forward to solve puzzles to overcome
my weakness to practice all those
timings how to overcome yourself and
trading the market heavily requires
confidence as well dedication of work
are not enough I think
perseverance and consistency is required
in your learning progress you have
probably experienced in the same
situation that I did a couple years back
and I did go through a lot of fake
mentors people for teaching fake stuff
all over the internet and I don't want
you to risk your money and your energies
all those people that creates content
that is not necessary in creating
financial independence so my goal is to
speed up your learning curve and help
you to achieve financial independence
much quicker than I did there's only one
thing wrong about this world

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys steven dux here welcome to
this youtube videos today we're going to
talk about a little bit different
strategy compared to the normal
method we're talking about pretty much
in other videos
so this strategy is specifically
designed for swing traders
that won't have a passive income by
trading
penny stocks and micro cap stocks let me
introduce this strategy and
make sure let me know if there you have
any questions or leave a comment below
as usual please click the like button
and subscribe it's going to really help
our youtube channel
to produce more videos and let's get
into this content
so in the first point i want to talk
about in the course of trading years
there is about five to ten maybe up to
20 tickers in 2020
they all formed different kinds of new
patterns
and this pattern has been existing in
pending stocks or microcap for a while
but as i said it don't happen that often
maximum
happen between 20 to 30 times a year
it's a very valuable strategy for
part-time twitter and let's give you
example
so the first example i'm gonna give will
be bngo this
is a little bit different compared to
other examples
and i will let you know why it's
different there's going to be two types
to use
the specific strategies and one of the
type is not very ideal
so uh it's really easy to mix two of
them up
so let me give you a clear example of
how to really spot this type of strategy
so first of all let's look at bngo
this is a ticker that if you look at the
long term
went from 50 cents to almost seven
dollars so the total gain
will be over a thousand percent the
first thing
you want to look at will be the total
gaining percentage it has to be over one
thousand percent
uh also it has to be above three dollars
normally that if the stock is under
three dollars it's not
going to produce the results you want to
so in this case bngo
is definitely over three dollar and it's
over one thousand percent
for this specific strategies the flow
and the market cap doesn't have a
restriction
so it can be as high as they want as
long as it's not
over 2 billion dollar or more so that's
the first criteria
second criteria you want to look at will
be how much data
has been traded up into the highest
consolidation
so bngo if you can see it it
consolidated between
5.7 to around seven dollars
so in that specific day it traded
close to 600 million volume
so 600 million times six to seven
in terms of total dollar traded is
around three to four billion dollar
traded in january fourth so that's
a lot of resistance to be able to use
this as a swing trade
you will have to short under the
consolidation
within about 10 to 15 percent your
potential entry
you have to be really close to the
consolidation because
normally the consolidation is pretty
wide
so it has a decent range between the
high of the consolidation
and the low of the consolidation so the
height of the consolidation is around
6.7 low of the consolidation is
5.9 so to be able to find
the entry after market open the closest
you can get
for bngl will be 5.8 to
6.5 and risk the high of the
consolidation will be
seven dollar area so personally for me
i will try to manage my positions into
the best
spot that has the correct risk
management so in my head
i was sizing about 30 around
5.5 to 5.6 that's right below
the consolidation and if it tends to go
up
and keep going test the highest of the
consolidation
i will need to have a risk in this case
i would rather be as close as to my risk
as possible
i would have a second entry point around
6.5 to average my first entry point
and that will give me the average of 6.3
to 6.1
so the ultimate position compared to the
risk
i'll be around 6.2 risking around 7. so
i'm risking
80 cents out of a seven dollar stock
which is not that bad and also you can
sizing a decent amount of positions
because bngo traded
500 million shares per day so it
provides a decent
and sufficient liquidity for you to go
in and out
without any trouble and also you don't
have to worry about
affecting the stock price so once you
find your ultimate positions sometimes
you don't get your sizing the full
position you want
but the normal risk reward you can get
is
up to 50 off the top sometimes 75
in terms of how long you want to hold so
for bngo maximum reward if you try to
cut the gans in half so let me
give you a decent example here so let's
say
this starting game is 50 cents
put the second horizontal line up to
here
and we want to measure the entire range
that was produced
for the last five days and you cut the
stock in half
so the max reward is anywhere between
3.5 to 3.7 that's after about a week or
two
but also it's depending on the chart as
well you want to look at where the
major support is and to be able to find
the maximum reward point so for
bngo for this specific case
you have a massive support around two to
three
so shorting around the 5.8 with
30 positions because we didn't get to
seasoning
into the middle of the consolidation
covering around
3.5 or above 3 you will be able to make
50 percent from your original positions
pretty close to 50
and this pattern will happen again and
again so three criterias for this
pattern
stock says to go up around one thousand
percent
or above one thousand percent second the
market cap has to be below
two billion dollar third you will have
to short below the consolidation if
there's no consolidations don't touch it
because you are a swing trader
and you want to look for the perfect
criteria to hold for days
not intraday trades you want to just get
into the actions and be able to make
money off that
you want the stock to fit your criteria
to meet your criteria
and follow the rules so that's for
entries
in terms of risk management part make
sure your risk
is within 15 percent if you exceed 15
to make sure sizing small because at
that point it's
probably not worth it to short a stock
if you're risking more than 15 percent
the last part will be the exit part
normally stock will cut in half
of the entire game make sure measure the
entire gain
then use that 50 as guide and also be
able to find the support
to get like a neutralized area it's
going to be a range
for bngo is anywhere between 3 to 3.5
depending on different stocks you will
have a different support
and a different 50 area so that's up to
you to find out
and that will be all the parts that i
can cover for this
specific swing strategies and if you

I I reclaimed the support area I exited
I was waiting for consolidations to
happen I start building my positions
into the 54 and 52 is of course I didn't
want to hold overnight cuz there is a
potential possibility that this one
could Gap up and I only held about 10K
shares overnight in the 52 is of course
if it breaks 54 I'll lose 20K and woke
up very early going to the next day and
start building my positions into the 49
my average is actually around I think
those are
49 and eventually got to 48 so I was
adding to the push into the secondary
test this one got little bit nervous
because my size was relatively big and
my risk is 54 so I'm risking $4 overall
within about I think it around 8K shares

[Music]
welcome to this video So today we're
going to do a recap of the current
tickers that's going uh pretty crazy in
the current market so uh updates that we
have a new course that's going to be
released in February and the current
pre-sale it's going to be the link below
and make sure to check that out without
further Ado uh let's get into the video
uh we have a lot of tickets to cover so
first of all we have PE GUI this is a
multi-day runner I went from one to four
and they had this consolidation
breakdown it actually trapped tons of
shorts into this consolidation so
typically when the shorts gets trapped
it needs to go up at least 60 from the
consolation area so the constellation is
around three so three times sixty
percent that's
0.8 then 4.8 that's minimum price not
the price needs to go up to
um so right now the stock is had two
layers of support one is around 3.4
lines around three so those two layers
of support are way too close to each
other
and that means the stock needs to
continue to go up and before it it goes
down into this two layers of support
because whenever you are shorting let's
say you're shooting around 4.5 you have
to cover it before 3.8 because that's
the support level then you if if it
drops under 3.4
then you have another support around
three to go through with so uh it's a
not very uh friendly to the short
Setters especially if you're showing to
this type of level so it's not very
ideal
um you this ticker needs to spec away
from the support at the only five to six
uh into massive consolidations uh this
is my thoughts on PE GUI
then we have snti uh this one was I
would category this one into an
overstein gap down uh on this day went
from 2.6 to 5 you got down then you
expect midday into 4.3 testing the
consolidations uh typically whenever
you're shorting into overextended gap
down
um you will need a three hour minimum
consolidations so
um this is not a consolidation typically
you won't
the consolidation to be the day high for
the overextended captain pattern so this
is not very ideal you can insure around
the 4.4 area level once they break
through this 4.4 then it's not really
treatable and there's a massive squeeze
for today I traded about 47 million
shares so ideally tomorrow if you can
test that seven dollar again into a
consolidation then it might be a
decenture so the neutralized areas are
around four so shorting around seven
covering around five
obviously it's ideal it's not a great
trade but some risk reward shooting
around they risking the 70 cents making
about
uh
2.5 dollars a share so one two three
yeah one two three uh in terms of risk
award ratio
so then you have
um a and b this is another IPO uh ticker
and whenever you see a ticker that's
performing a consistently downtrending
chart typically the chart can around for
one up to three days so shooting on the
first green day is not very ideal
including ensuring into consolidations
so shooting in the
amb it's not very ideal into the
consolidations uh ideally if it
continues around tomorrow then we'll see
how much dollar block they can get into
the following day so those are my
thoughts for those and it's giving a
decent amount of volumes the market is
actually having some type of play now so
the edge is not
there yet hopefully
pgy can give us a decent I would say 200
million volume a day then aw amb can
give us maybe
a 30 medium volume
um 50 dollar
or 20 million pound fifty dollar ish
into a consolidation now those
conditions will be ideal to show up
that'll be all my thoughts for those
stickers uh thank you very much for
watching I will see you guys in the next
one
thank you

welcome to this video So today we're
going to talk about all the plays
between July and August there's tons of
bankruptcy plays that produces
profitable trades there were some traps
as well so especially how to really
avoid all those traps with those
multi-day Runners we're gonna take a
deep dive into it make sure to click the
like button and subscribe and let's get
into the video alright the first two
multi-day boners that we have and is
y-e-l-l and tub so let's take a look at
Yol first the extension count from 60
cents to five dollars so the overall
extension is close to one thousand
percent there were some support and
resistance levels though I want to point
it out so this one meant about two days
in total and a parabolic on the second
day of that massive support August 1st
traded about 200 million shares that
means there were 200 million support
that Consolidated between 2.83 and
whenever you are shorting a motivate
Runners you do not want to shorten to
support so going to the potential red
day that the stock opened and I think
treated around five to four million
shares in the pre-market and it's not
going to exceed all the 200 million
shares that was traded yesterday that
also means the stock is likely to lose
the quality throughout the day and it's
probably going to drop and here comes
the conflicting factors because you have
this massive support between 2.5 to 3.5
and you will never know when the stock
is likely to bounce into this fade
because there's all types of support
between 2.5 and 3.4 and shorting into
this state it means you are shorting
your support and there's a very good
chance that stock can instantly reverse
in one candle something like this
from 2.1 to 3.4 all your profits will be
gone if you are shorting at open
whenever you're running into these type
of motive owners my recommendations is
do not touch at all because if they are
fading to support it's very difficult to
fade through high density support which
is above 100 million now buying is
traded into a consolidation while on the
first red day not treatable now go into
the second day typically that shooting
after first grade day is a very
profitable trait and in this case it's
not really because it gapped up into 3.4
and you pushed back down again and did
exactly the same thing compared to
yesterday Bounce from that support went
all the way to 4.4 and typically when
everyone is short into a push from heavy
support the extension has to be around
60 or above so if you mark the support
is around three and then you need to
push to 4.8 before it's shortable and it
did not produce enough range and also
there's not enough resistance around 4.6
or 5 there's only one failed parabolic
right there so go into this day still
not affordable and there is some
resistance that was formed between 4 to
4.6 and it consolidates throughout the
entire day traded about 30 million
shares so total shares traded between 4
to 4.6 is 120 million shares that's
around times four that's around 480 480
million to I would say 550 million in
that range the dollar block that I've
been tracking for pretty much all the
motivated honors but I do not think yel
is not very reliable since there's
massive support around three so going to
the following Monday which is going to
be next week I do not think this one
will fade through the support and it
will probably do three to five percent
each day until you slowly tracks that
2.5 support which is the final Island I
do not think it's worth it there's a
much greater chance that this one could
bounce back and take her profits that'll
be 2p this is more of a long opportunity
than shorting I'm not even going to be
surprised if this one pushed back again
and breaks 4.4 that won't go up even
higher and let's go through QP this is
also another bankruptcy play the
extension is between 70 cents to six
dollars you can see that as a
multi-develer the criteria is the stop
needs to go up consistently three days
in consecutive candles and each candle
has to trade more volume compared to the
previous one so if you count July 26 27
28th and the 28th it needs to trade more
volume 200 million and turns out it
didn't it did a very small red day but
after that push through that rear candle
and we go up even higher and then once
they perform the first red day I'm going
to the following after first red day
then we had the news now push enough to
hour and this one is doing a refinancing
this sticker is resistance and support
is pretty much everywhere let's take a
deep look into the entry charts we
started to spike around 70 cents
extension 800 percent expected to 6 5.6
and you can see that we formed a massive
support around three on this day July 27
traded about 200 million shares in July
28 to traded about 100 million shares
once and the stock breaks through that
3.7 there's a total around 300 million
support and the stock number dropped and
expect even further went all the way to
5.6 as I said for the stock to become
affordable again it needs to spike 60
percent above the support now let's take
a look at the support it started to
really Spike around 3.6 so if you're
using 2.6 times 1.6 that's close to five
dollars once they consolidate between
the five dollars you're going to the
first red day still this is not very in
tradable if you take a look at the
entire bigger picture first of all you
traded at 140 million shares between 5.3
to 5.6 the total dollar box is around
500 million but if you're using the
dollar bulk and consolidations to short
into a multitude Banner we want to take
a look at the support because you do not
want to see multiple bounces because is
going to be frustrating and the profits
is not going to look very good and also
it's likely to check you out as well
there is support around 4.5 support
around four no support around 3.73 and
you can see that on each level it is
bouncing from the support bouncing the
pre-market bouncing the midday balancing
the end of the day and it's also
bouncing after first thread day so
that's where you have to learn how to
take profits especially you're shooting
the first red day whatever you are
looking at multiple support layers of
support those stickers are very typical
to shorting too and even though going
into the next week Char is not going to
be clean anymore Port everywhere and I
recommend it shorting going into the
future let's talk about the profitable
place first one we have a myth this one
extension is about 400 stiking around 40
cents it is capping up in the after hour
and the chart is pretty much very
straightforward and clean we had
consider conditions around two typically
that we want to see sixty percent or
above the consolidations which will be
it's assume it's two and 60 so 3.2 at
the very least going to Monday if it
wants to become shortable total of 100
million support that's formed around two
as well going into the next day the
stock needs to trade more than 123
million shares it's number two number
three because typically that we're
looking at motiv owners there is a
difference between multi-developers
first one that we saw is three
consecutive candles that each candle's
volume has to be larger than the
previous day volume and we're looking at
something that's going massive parabolic
that has gaining three four hundred
percent in one day typically this
subjectures turn into a multi Runners
but they typically only last between two
to three days not going to be last like
seven days like yell or tup each state
only inspect about 30 percent window
stops speeds up like that MF spikes 100
and 100 in one day if he expects 100 on
Monday this will quickly become
shortable once it forms consolidations
and make sure that you are now shooting
to a support so for example if it gaps
down on Monday uh let's say opens around
2.3 then it's impossible to show it into
MF because you do not want to show the
new support typically two dollar stops
are difficult to shortening too there's
another example you can take a look at
the reference of Ahi this one is very
similar to MF and this one the other
reverse split so I think there's a spec
between 30 cents to three dollar and
they had a massive periodic on first
Green Day conform consolidations on the
second day then the major drop is on
after the first rare day the only
difference between Ahi and MF is Ahi
didn't form a consolidation ikmf so
shorty into MF is you have to be much
more careful compared to Ahi the very
similar chart and go ahead and take a
look at it use this as a reference
there is tons of opportunities even
though we're in a better market and
rounding into all those bankruptcy
tickers a lot more often compared before
IPOs and the bankruptcy players are
turning to motivated Runners very
similar to Hertz that we traded in 2021.

there's tons of bankruptcy plays that
produces profitable trades there were
some traps as well so especially how to
really avoid all those traps with those
multi-day Runners we're gonna take a
deep dive into it so let's take a look
at Yol first the extension come from 60
cents to five dollars so the overall
extension is close to one thousand
percent so this one meant about two days
in total and a parabolic on the second
day of that massive support August 1st
traded about 200 million shares that
means there were 200 million support
that Consolidated between 2.83 and
whenever you are shorting a motivated
Runners you do not want to shorten to
support as a multi developer the
criteria is the stop needs to go up
consistently three days in consecutive
candles and each candle has to trade
more volume compared to the previous one
all right

welcome to this video So today we're
going to do a recap of what what is
going on the current market and couple
takers I want to go through for future
plays so overall I will give my thoughts
about the current plays and how it's
really follow the current market
conditions so uh before we get into the
video make sure to click the like button
and subscribe uh let's get into it so
today we have gtii and F and gr and atxi
so those three tickers are the potential
play into the next week or into the next
couple weeks uh atxi is a micro float
this is 700k flow and it's doing its
breakout after it's run from 5 to 11
couple days ago so this one is a reverse
split uh basically the reverse split is
you reduce the Flow by a significant
amount some most of the penny stocks
reduce it about 10 times or more keeps
it down under 3 million it becomes a
lower flow or microphone low and they
can Pump It Up and dump it so this is
one of the classic play atxi it had its
breakout right about here if you take a
look look at the two months and 15
minute chart so it broke out through
this consolidation on the stage traded
about 54 million shares so that's plenty
of support on Friday it pulled back down
a little bit into the support So This is
actually a potential long into the next
week I would say before it becomes a
short it needs to extend at least 300
percent from the consolidation price so
I have a consolation here around 9
cancellation around 11 around 10. so he
needs to go to at least 30 before it
becomes short and I would prefer going
along on this instead of shorting and
always there's a risk of offering after
hours and into the weekend so I do not
recommend holding it overnight
especially when you're not going along
but this is more of a long and short uh
that's for atxi x f n g r
this uh is a NASDAQ so uh not much
volume from the bottom and you only
treat it about 30 million shares on
Friday it needs to trade much more at
least 100 million shares in the current
market conditions so I'll assume that if
you could pushes to five trade it around
100 million shares and uh gaps down the
next day so this will be a potential uh
short into the next week not recommend
you go in on since there is not much
support going on uh hopefully you can
get tons of volume uh
oh F in GR
then we have gtii this is the OTC
OTC normally is really difficult to get
executed and especially on the shorting
side
um it's traded a certain amount of
volume and it's up a decent amount about
a thousand percent almost overall
OTC are very difficult to trade dollar
block does not apply into the OTC
tickers and basically you are using the
gesture disk close goes negative on the
day
then you might be a pretend you're short
but for that the factor is not strong
enough or the resistance is not strong
enough uh majority of the OTC plays you
need assassin pretty small uh since
the liquidity is not there and also it's
hard to get executed when whenever you
are pushing uh size into those stickers
so those are the three tickers that's uh
has potential into the next week or from
my current uh I would say statistics
that I'm tracking for the current
Mercury conditions we're still not back
in the 2019-2018 market yet the ticker
still gets this amount of volume
sometimes close to 100 million on our
lower flow is around 60 million so it's
still much higher than before and I
would say that in the next couple
month we will have
several Runners before December since
October and November and December those
three months are the hottest months of
the year so hopefully you can get one
final couple Runners before we head into
uh pretty much zero equality uh If the
Fed keeps raising rates and reduce the
balance sheet so those are three takers
that will be a potential play for the
next couple weeks and that'll be it for
this recap video thank you very much for
watching I will see you guys in the next
one

hello guys steven ducks here welcome to
this video so in this video we're going
to briefly go over uh some of the
content i want to cover in the
conference during 2021 because of covet
the covet years
that we weren't be able to
give a live in-person conference so in
this one i'm going to share all my
experience not again from 2020 2021 and
you know 2022 as well
and to give out my um
new updated statistics and what did i
learn in those few years uh so i will be
specifically go over of how i really
track statistics and how to be able to
aim for the highest winning percentage
pattern and how to stay i would say of
course very disciplined training in the
penny stock industry i'll say one of the
most important thing is how to really
structure your trades i think i went
over in the
house in the youtube videos before that
i category my trades so number one of
course has the highest winning
percentage and highest less risk highest
reward category two will be
i would say gap up shore
a lower winning percentage bounce shore
and category 4 will be everything gap
down and you know different patterns
land into into a different categories
and i will use because throughout one to
four different categories they have its
own winning percentage so i will be able
to
size in bigger into the higher winning
percentage pattern and the sizing lower
into the lower winning percentage
pattern
in this way it will give me the highest
reward
uh trading
those patterns and give me i would say
same amount of risk
by separating all those
patterns into different categories so
that i will be go over specifically and
into detail into the conference the
conference will be starting less than 10
days make sure grab your tickets and

the strength of the ticker especially
that trades decent amount of volum in
the pre-market becomes very
unpredictable especially when you are
trying to short in the open with lower
float the spiking percentages is much
higher with higher float there's pretty
much no spiking percentages you want to
track that if the flow is between 1 to 2
million 2 to 5 million 5 million plus 10
million plus 20 million plus to see that
if the ticker is likely to generate a
push or not

the yearly performance I would say that
you do not want to stay in a specific
ticker for very long the spikes are very
short period the time n has been
shortened pretty much 90% as we seen
that in AMC gme in 2020 they can stay at
a very high level MC was trading around
60 for almost half a year before it
dropped this year it only lasted uh a
day so the spikes itself has been
shortened uh a lot the volume is still
there so you can still sizeing a lot of
shares and just by looking through
pretty much all the opportunity
throughout 2024 uh there's a bunch of
low floats that's been happening and one
thing I want to talk about is the
neutralized area and the volume
specifically at the premarket

there is couple sections where we're
looking at in the pre-market volume is
if the volume is trading uh between I
would say less than 7 million over 4
million that's where that you can use
the Vol estimate to pretty much estimate
the entire day volume but if the volume
goes over then 7 to 10 million that's
where becomes a little crowded but it's
still tradable then if the volume goes
over than 10 million and majority of the
time you are seeing over 20 million
volume in the premi market unless in
level it creates massive range it say
it's up 1,000% 2,000% if it's only up
200% then it's not tradeable and if
you're shorting into those very croud
tickers it may end very badly

there's few reasons why I want to do
this DVD first I think there's a big
problem with the educational system
there's too much commercials and there's
too much on mr. informations you don't
need to know and I don't want to create
a course that goes straight into the
core information about training and you
can buy into the stock market next day
the second reason I want to do this is
you can improve my strategies like ideas
rule matter mentors and you have the
chance to have faster success than me
and the last point is out to prove you
can achieve anything if you put enough
hard work and time into it English is
not my first language at the beginning I
have to read all the SEC filings and
financial statements and I have come all
the stiff colors and I believe we can do
as well there will be three things to be
included in this DVD will be number one
there'll be my unique technical analysis
and my perspective of trading second
there will be three different risk
management methods for beginning
intermediate and experienced traders at
the last will be also include four
different strategies and four different
short strategies for part-time and
full-time traders combined with details
and specific rule for each strategies
the steveley include all my hard work
and my trading experience I'm planning
to sell the amount of copies out there

Let me explain one strategy. So it's
based on human nature. Originally the
strategy comes from human nature. So let
me give you example. Let's say you
bought a stock at $10. Stock drops to
$1. Next day you feel very frustrated.
After 2 months stock hasn't moved at
all. After 6 months stock gapped up to
$7, $8. Your instant reaction is to sell
at the open. 99% of the time people want
to cut their losses even. So I'm in
there knowing you going to sell. I will
place myself in a short positions. As
soon as you sell cause a huge red panic
as other people having the same
reaction, then I'll be able to take that
28% in profit.

I think that's the losses came from
April and going I'll say the starting
from June to December all we had was
btics low floats micro floats and
tickers that do not provide enough
liquidity to short all the tickers that
we being experiencing are anywhere
between $3 to $7 it's not like we
typically run into the tickers in 2021
the average prices we're trading at will
be 10 to 20 and now we're dealing with
much lower price stocks and also lower
volume so there's not much room to s in

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let's look at Stephen doctor in this
YouTube video we're gonna talk about
some of the questions that people ask me
in the YouTube videos and I select a
couple questions that a lot of people
want me to answer so here we go
hopefully you guys enjoy this videos and
all of you should be helpful alright so
first question what do trade Forex
what broker do you use so actually penny
stocks also called micro cap and I don't
really trade Forex
so what broker do you use I use trade
zero Centerpoint
as well what strategies do you use when
you short mvy on day two now this is a
tricky question because it's not really
qualified as any type of pattern
it's a multi-day runner green to red
short that craft a major momentum I will
talk about that strategy later but this
doesn't really qualify the pound short
cap up short so it's a multi-day runner
now typically when the stock loses about
50% of its going again in really short
amount time the stock is considered to
be lost its momentum so I'll be why it
did that and that's why I shorted it
into a bounce of course not setting too
much because it didn't really bounce
that far
that's the question number two number
three which is relatively very long I
don't really understand why do you still
courses and show people how to make
money if you can't make that huge amount
of money which is good for individual
not a hedge fund why don't you keep
yourself now the reason why I want you
give courses because I want to convince
all the infos together so and it makes
other people easier tuner and increase
your learning curve now when I started
learning I have to gather over two
informations and going through worthless
courses it gives me a hard time tuner
and that is my goal for all education
because when I was either in high school
or grade school I found that problem
pretty much all the time so my dream or
my goal is to condense infos and give it
to people that's it that's one of them
goes to to pursue and also how people
make you money
makes me feel great as well number four
has Steven understanding you like
shooting parabolic but I actually took a
trade on PRV be based on your pre market
breakout strategies and yes the trade
who did we do not really fit the
criteria so that's not considered as a
pretty market strategies because the
pre-market breakout needs to be twenty
to fifty percent consolidation the pre
market by sorry up 150% on PR VP's
already it doesn't really qualify as a
pattern but you did it anyways so yes
it's overwhelming of volume
I wasn't it wasn't really treating a
huge amount of volume so I will say you
got lucky there and yes sometimes trade
my work you might get lucky because
we're training based on odds so let's
say kept up short sometimes works 8 out
of 10 times and you hit that 2 times you
went along good for you because you got
lucky and but you know long term round
you shouldn't come out ahead and make
sure focus on the correct strategies and
track statistics as well because you
don't really put real money on the line
if you don't know what's the odds of it
practice statistics you will help you a
lot
so what trading platform you use I use
3-0 you can use - trader pearl you can
use trade 0 platform they all have
charts and my scanner is basically very
simple app which I will talk about later
another question recap analysis closed
markets easy unless you truly live and
why don't you make honest one video
showing us how to perform the market ok
so I do live trading my brand all the
time I do three webinars per week for my
students every single morning just a
live trade and I don't really have much
time because I'm
the informations so that's the reason
why I don't want to make a video is TD
Ameritrade a good broker the answer is
it depends on what strategy are trading
because if I go mom yes TD Ameritrade is
no problem you can execute your shares
and no problem and you feel want to pick
up short strategies then TD Ameritrade
is a bad broker because you don't get
shares to shore and you get the
opportunity but I don't get it shares
that's the reason and depends on mass
right you are picking so if you're
basically wants to go along then go for
you if you were charged are based on
shorts and then TD Ameritrade it's not a
choice people always make fun at me so
you are not serious making so you're not
very serious about weekend about 9:15
a.m. to trade locates are typically gone
at that time alright so this is the
reason I get up at 9:15
so first multi-day runners right if the
stock performs multi tail it's a first
going the signature green day and the
first growing day expected to drop I
will wake up early I wake up at 7 a.m.
to reserve the shares in fest see a
first green day that is got top and it's
a super low float because only low flow
Lopez gets gone very very fast and and
that's typically microphone so when the
macro flow happens I don't really don't
trade on for a screen day so that
prevents me from over trading on the
first queen day and take a loss so it's
better not to have locate and on the
first screen day a visitor no multi-tier
honor but you donor typically happens
like 15 times per year so most of the
days I wake up at 9:15 and do webinars
and I look at shares if you're some
micro flow I
I told me about what a bother sometimes
I do miss some opportunities but not
that much can i from you 40k and you can
take half the profits and the answer is
no put your own put your effort in the
market there's all kinds of materials
you can earn you make sure you benefit
yourself it's not gonna plan it for
others focus on yourself don't rely on
other people and just try to improve
yourself so the answer is no I want him
to accept 40k and Trey white violent
really I can
traded 40k by myself and make all the
profits I can never find painting stocks
that gain a thousand percent and working
fine these and he's aware too for them
to appear so a thousand percent happens
about ten times 20 times per year
they then he feels a multi day that
happens about 50 times per year in the
unique on over a thousand percent and
the scanner I use very simple so listen
up so first 20 percent or above in the
pre-market before market open second
volume needs to be over 100k in the free
market if it's not 100k it's not really
tradable third the pre-market can so
when the trend is going up consolidates
that's readable stock and even though
it's going down is so still treatable
stock if the in the pre market trends up
and loses 50% of base again in the
pre-market not treatable so that's all
the stuff I filtered out then go from
there and there's all kinds of bonuses
after that but that's basically my
schedule so uh that'd be the video of
all hopefully the content is helpful

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys steven here uh so today i'm
going to react the top students
that verified on gimbal i'm going to
look through their trades and to see
what they did wrong what the what they
did right
other than that let's dive into it for
the students that made over six figure
or seven figures and let's look at
through their trades and to see if
they're disciplined and they're
practicing good habits so let's get into
it this student wants me to review his
trades so i might as well let's do it on
the youtube
so let's see
uh
he made
cyto lost 4k on this one so he shorted
up there and bought it with the same
candle so that's a scalp right there
this is another short last 26 thousand
let's see what he do
so it was the same type of sales sales
sale by so that was a small loss
on this candle that keeps going up so
that was
he says them pretty heavy now kendo
first of all
you shouldn't even be trading cyto
because you want to avoid
stocks that's over
what's under
five dollars so all those trades are not
necessary 4k 4k that's 8k
26.52
57.
so those 57 000 are not worth it and you
can see it your name is sexy short
seller you made 62k 64k on cyto by
shooting at the top cover at the bottom
right
so this is what i'm talking about that i
as you are my students and you're in the
program and you're supposed to know that
you shouldn't trade stock that's under
five dollar right and just look at your
profit and the losses
this 164k pretty much equals all your
losses combined together so by the end
of the day you spend that much time
trading cyto
you end up with
pretty much nothing then zero so
that tells you it's not worth it so next
time don't trade
stocks that's under five dollars all
right let's look at other trades traded
rivn this is a
100 stock
uh it was a short position shortly that
118 covered at 1.9
this is not necessary too so this one
that 6.5 k should be you know
you shouldn't be even trading that so
that's permanent that's avoidable
afrm this is
another
100 stock so you're making
money
expensive stock also losing at the same
time so i want to give you
one suggestion track all your stocks
that's
under five dollar
and also a hundred dollar stocks
track all your losses and wins to see
do you actually come ahead or no if it's
you don't come ahead don't trade those
stocks it's not really worth it
all right let's look at all the stocks
that's
where he uh
that's
actually tradable so
51k um
r and xt short look at this one this one
is within a profitable range
you made a lot of trade on this one well
first of all
you are
so carving and adding and in the same
same range
that's not
don't don't don't do that if you are not
sure you want uh
covering weaknesses and and sewing
strain so you want to add in the 10-ish
right here
so this one fits the price range that
you're supposed to trade and look at you
and you made 51 000.
all the losses that you took previously
are just very very
expensive stock or very cheap stocks
right ppsi
this one you lost 59 000 you made 68
000.
you took a lot of losses on ppsi
were you trying to go along
all right see look at this
this is just over trading look uh let me
see your first trade so first trade
you made money
second trade made money long long long
long
then you just
got over on your head i guess you're
trying to show in the afternoon took a
huge loss
right here
shortly in the morning so when ppsi it
was a six you shorted it
up in the afternoon you sized in way too
much
for 59 000 loss so you sized in about
whoa it says doing 500 000 on this one
short it sized in way too much
lost 12
yeah
so you had a hundred thousand shares
showing that six for stock that's about
up about
a hundred percent not worth it
not worth the favorite account says just
by looking at your losses and wins your
account size is roughly around
two three hundred thousand so so you're
actually using average on this one
don't do leverage
they make sixty eight thousand by going
short
covering here
all right this one this one looks
your trades on ppsi is not clean at all
you're trying to catch every single
action it's not worth it now first of
all making a trade on this one's fine if
this is a classic gap up short you can
short into the push
and cover in
when it's pulling back
and as soon as the stock breaks the
morning high which is right here seven
something 720
that's where you should stop trading you
just kept trading on after that breakout
after that stock doesn't meet no
patterns at all and look at
you make took almost a hundred thousand
loss after that not worth it all right
let's uh look at other people's trading
so i look at
this is one of students that
uh from um
the challenge
this is a
there's another
super town is here
sexy short sellers here
let's do one year
let's look at j35
this is in our students that made 300
000.
let's see
i was looking at it this morning didn't
took a deep dive on it
so ppsi short he made money on that it's
not bad let me see what what do you
short
with surely on the breakdown
so he showed it
on the bounce short okay it's not that
bad um
so i'm sure
she took a loss on ppsi showing at the
top that's the first green day right
there
he stopped trading after that and that's
good this is a very good discipline so
this loss it's
necessary and it's also it can
this is unavoidable losses but you can
reduce the loss right here for ppsi ppsi
made dwc 62 000 dwc shorts 6.4k so this
is where i live traded on dwc so you
made a bank on that one we also
hemmed on cei shore so you made
a huge bank on ceo as well so those two
games are almost worth
70k plus 60k 130k
another cui short
one
50k so you made 140 150k on cei and uh
dwc alone all the trades remain after
pretty small
oh it'll be long
that's not bad
long in the candle
lower floats
as long as not bad
yeah you don't you cut your losses
pretty quick
very good habits much better than the
last one
but before that
we took a lot of losses on amc
mrin
oh yeah this one was a difficult one so
this was available it only lost 800 on
that one
i don't see
giant losses like the last one so
in terms of discipline you are doing
much better
in terms of over trading you are still
doing much better than the last one
losses are still manageable though
so in terms of habits uh in terms of
profit and gain percentages j35 is doing
much better
losses are pretty relatively small
compared to the wins so this is
on its way to be very profitable trader
so
very good discipline um
and uh
only thing you can work on is
your
losses and this one got out of control a
little bit so sad staying a little bit
too big but
other than that
you didn't really make money on ppsi
yeah ppsi was a weird one that would be
the two reviews for the students
that's on top of the leaderboard
in terms of their
trading habits and always
look at your trades to see what is
necessary what is not and
in terms of the last not one that's name
is sexy short setters he does a lot of
over trading and
he um doesn't manage his risk very well
and he's sizing way too big now j35
has a very solid
risk control and he know winter sizing
big window sizing small
in terms of habits j35 wins but in terms
of profits
j35 if if if both of them keep the same
habits and their same training habits
j35 will eventually come on top so
that'll be it for this video have any
questions leave a comment below and
thank you very much for watching i'll
see you guys

hello guys Stephen Ducks here so today
we're gonna go ahead and review the
recent trades
there's our very similar patterns and
actions so one to go over the details of
all those trades and especially all
those IPOs into the second day they do
have really profitable pattern but also
they do squeeze pretty hard especially
with the low liquidity it's really hard
to get at your good entry and exit so uh
in this video we're going to go over
pretty much all of those technical
analysis uh behind all those IPO plays
other than that we have a new course
that already came out I will link in BIO
so make sure to check it out and let's
get started first of all I want to go
over uh zura this is the first ticker
that happened this week it had a very
similar actions compared to Ambi so if
you take a look at it
same IPO kind of similar price as well
very similar volume should about six
million shares on the first Green Day so
Ura traded about four five minute shares
four mini shares on the first Green Day
on the Ura was a little bit more
expensive compared to Ambi the only
difference between Ambi and zura is
z-u-r-a is a biotech Ambi is Industrials
so we can look at the performance on the
second day so go ahead look at March
15th uh test the resistance came all the
way back down to 10 and this is a
classic overseeing goddamn whatever you
want to pay attention is the difference
between those two charts they look very
similar volume when you are dealing with
the biotech sectors you have to be
really careful and they do not act very
normal compared to other Industries or
other sectors they also always pay
attention to the morning weaknesses or
afternoon with weaknesses so with Ambi
lost about 50 on the first Green Day
there's going to be a lot of eager back
order zones to get out into the
consolidations so that's why you have
the 18 rejection test 17 Again fade it
all the way back down but if you look at
zura today you didn't really have the
pullback Like A and B I did so that's
one of the red flags number two is it
had its morning weaknesses test uh the
resistance yesterday came all the way
back because the liquidity is really low
so tiny amount of volume can push the
stock to three dollars a share so if you
are going to sizing a decent amount of
size on these stocks are now for you
always aim less than one percent of the
volume being traded throughout the day
so let's say the stock traded around 1
million you're only looking at to sure
maybe 10K it has to be less than 10K so
the stock came all the way back up to
test the high Consolidated you can see
that it did not crack even though you
pulled about negative 30 after open so
this is why biotechs are not very
profitable because they do not perform
the same and it has made a pretty much
old conditions it Consolidated about
three hours today into the 30-38 the
consolidation range is within 25 percent
right around the mark came all the way
back test 37 consolidate again so you
are looking at Double resistance if it
cracks it turns out it did not crack
and we're going into the third day so
this is likely to squeeze even higher if
it breaks the 37 area so I would
recommend avoiding obviously gap down on
biotech especially on IPOs not very
profitable not very ideal even though it
has made pretty much all the criteria I
would aim for something that's very
similar to Ambi first Green Day it has
to have a big pull before the close then
we come back and test the resistance
into the second day make sure that the
stock is trading a decent amount of line
you can see trading more volume compared
to zura there is no u-shaped type of
reversal this one came all the way back
tested around 17 so if it tends to break
out 18 I want and you know he wanted to
size down because whenever you see
u-shape reversal after a large pole
typically that's conflicting with the
shorting factors so that's something
that you have to pay attention to
alright guys that'll be in this video
thank you very much for watching make
sure to check out the LinkedIn bio I
will see you guys in the next video

what's up guys still in duck sir
here comes a new video lessons of the
week and today we're going to talk about
PE D and G B R so we are going to have
two tickers that happened last week and
they both friend P getting clear and
about 2,000 percent so I'm going to talk
about my exactly thought process on PE D
and how I trade it so basically I think
it was on Wednesday so the stock is
going up parabolic and start
consolidating in a mid day of one point
I wish so in one dollar specific level
when under one dollar stock starting
breaking now that one dollar because
people like to shorting out round number
and when they get overwhelmed well when
they get squeezed they typically get
freaked out and that's why I support the
supporting one point or holding really
really well
the first pullback was at 120 and it
just bounced back instantly and just
keeps haunting and hurting and hurting
and feminists are consulting around
about one o'clock and started doing the
mid tapered pattern that I talked about
a couple months ago now in my youtube
video if you want to see it go check it
out and it finished really really strong
then it gapped up in the morning and
almost pushed to forking paths so of the
theory I'm developing it which is the
maximum squeeze in percentage
so I'm guessing um almost shorts are
stocking around one point I wish one
point six ish and when they cover there
is a specific percentage they're going
to cover their short positions when it
hits that a level with out there okay
I'm going to cover there so I'm going to
a huge roster on my account so I
typically use 1.6 1.5 times to 60%
that's typically the maximum squeezing
percent will be but on this one it's a
little bit different
involved with so many holes and he
wouldn't need you to after our start
getting up and pretty much up up as well
and come into the Thursday I see there's
weakness in the pre-market and couldn't
really squeeze after hitting that 4.4
level so it can't come down I'm looking
to short in morning push and in the
morning was kind of weird
you pushed up and got stuffed and pushed
up got stopped again and finally hits
that pre-market high and when it's
starting
during the downtrending when this 4:15
didn't hold that well and start breaking
as 370 level that's where I started
sizing in my shorts and assessed in all
the way before 370 track and it went all
the way to $2 so I made I think I made
around 17,000 and other students made
around 30,000 30,000 more 20,000 so this
is a really low flow play so you have to
be really really careful because we are
shorting without a priori resistance it
is really dangerous because it can
easily squeeze on you and you don't have
a specific risk level to cut your losses
then all those 2,000 percent three
thousand percent because when they went
out two thousand percent and if you
short it it doesn't need a reason to go
over three thousand percent four
thousand percent
so in that case shooting with those
massive volatility stocks they also come
with a huge risk and they also come with
a big volatility is on both sides so
either they go up to the other person
there they come down 70 percent so in
this case you can see drop from 4:30 to
almost $2
that's almost 50 that's already 5060
percent and each time we drop this hard
every single bonds will fail in the next
day when they start bouncing because
there's just too many people holding in
this massive job and as you can see it
couldn't really break this level of 2.6
$3 ish and I took a short in the MPD 2.6
2.7 - I think I post on Twitter
screenshot and also lie better in my
chair and I think everybody know that
cover into the this week is 2.17
iPhone and take that and I thought you
cannot go lower but turns out I didn't
and close that around the same level and
say covered so that's a that's the
general process on PD top process and
later on on the stock I'm pretty sure
it's gonna keep fading so we're gonna do
offering all the way to where they come
from so in the future lies he's probably
gonna come with couple bounces going to
look too short into it but other than
that it keeps fading I wouldn't be
touching it so another one on gbr this
stock has so many failed spikes and it's
really really sketchy and you can see in
a historical chart and it has a run
massive resistance in the 520 ish and
the resistance is kind of in the 2016 so
which is two years ago and when you're
shorting using two-year resistance
that's not really very good so when
you're our short sellers be careful when
the resistance are too far forward over
two years that's not ideal and now on
Friday I had a huge because it's kind of
tempered appraised with PD and PD drop
in GPR drop that as well almost dropped
or where they came from and on Friday it
squeezed all the way to 5
and it has so many traps traps so many
people on Twitter people shortening the
twos people shortening the threes people
shorting in using 2.6 as a risk level
and we cut it and stop instant drop so
when it bounces again they showed it
again and it gets squeezed again to the
four point seven then people bought
buying into this break Cal and it turns
out to be a fake trap huge and now when
I drop them when they drop from 450 to
$3.00 people think okay this stuff is
dead it's coming it's gonna drop - all
the way - - then turns out it squeezed
up to the four and hold really strong
into the clothes and I'm pretty sure
almost all shorts it was really covered
into the clothes and nobody wants to
hold short overnight unless you're
insane so I think there's decent around
resistance in to nourish I think it's
going to work but down on this really
really low flow study is really a gamble
holding overnight you can easily do
offering or it can easily cap down 20%
30% all those big boys they because the
flow is too low they can just buy the
entire flow and manipulating that stuff
and that's where the retail the retail
buyers or short sellers are losing money
because all the money goes to the big
boys and the more money you have the
more money you make and that that
generally applies on those really really
low flow stocks so when you have a small
town try to avoid the flow under let's
say three million because they're just
too tiny and whenever a market cap is
very small also they're just too
manipulated and gbri seen too many level
two medications up up in the tubes up in
the trees and they keep refreshing the
beds like you keep pushing the stock and
when people are scared and selling and
there's huge bits and people are
confident binders who just and
they drop 30 40 cents not with a with a
small town you can't really afford that
so try to avoid this place and the
volume was trading really almost treated
ten times of the flow rotation so very
very dangerous and I will see how it
comes into on the Monday and I'm
guessing it's gonna get down and push
then three all the way to the close but
you can't really guarantee on these you
can ease the gap up if it gaps up don't
know how it's gonna play it out on this
one and we'll keep I will keep an eye on
it and typically on those low flow
starts reading 20 minutes years it's
kind of too much they typically don't
treat down much volume
we'll see how to come into the Monday
and I think that's two stickers I'm not
going to talk about today and also gone
congrats one of my students he made
saying 60,000 in two days on Thursday
and Friday
I think he's shooting a PIL
all the way he topdecked a vio he's
asking my opinion I think I think it was
consolidation into the clothes let's
take a look I think he covered in the
thingy covering to the seven or eight
shorting the third teams and the next
big player was PDA I think I called that
23.7 sure in my chat room and everybody
I think everybody know that if they had
shares too short
so recently all the players are biased
on shorts on the lawns it doesn't really
have it doesn't really have an edge to
really size into it because either day
you're too late or either they you can't
really predict we need to break out and
you are holding through a hole and
either you don't know it's a lottery
hole or it's gonna be a t12 hold on
those really low penny stocks I don't
know you guys remembers when of stock
halted at one dollar level and I thought
was a volatility stop and I got stuck in
it it was a t12 and dropped to I think
about six 65 cents in dropped you once
they opened up to 25 cents so I lost
like 40 percent on that one fortunately
I didn't size in that much but uh with
those too many holes it's not really
treatable so let's see how it comes into
the next month hopefully my video lesson
is helpful and if it's not please don't
hate this is free lessons and you wanna
take something away you go ahead take
something away if you don't like it you
just don't watch it thank you very much
and you guys have a great day

Stephen ducks here and today I'm gonna
talk about all those recent super super
specters for the past couple days and
well before I get into it I want to talk
about my DVD part three and part four
so powerful it's all about statistics
and you will be coming really soon I
think will be around two or three weeks
so stay tuned and the part three I don't
still I don't have enough examples for
the DVD yet so I would your survey so if
you want a complete lab trading part
three then you have to wait for a little
bit longer but if you want partial of it
and I can update later on I can do that
as well so it really depends on how the
server goes and abilities have found
there and from last couple videos people
are basically giving me some hate people
saying like my english is bad or can we
talk about our trades or like the
statistics it's like high school stuff
like if you don't want to watch my video
it's okay
you don't need to watch it because all
I'm saying from the heart is to help for
beginner traders to understand what's
going on in the chart so you don't need
to watch the video if you don't like it
so I don't know why get so much hit
anyway alright let's get into recent
Spikers so gvo went from I think was 3
to 20 on that day and I did caught
partial of it my children thought you
can't even go to $20 22 and as you can
see now if you zoom close the stock
gapped up from three point six to five
and there's not that much heavy
resistance around so when the stock
doesn't have big enough heavy resistance
when because when stock gaps up
long-term shareholders wants to sell
their stocks because this toughness it
hasn't been doing nothing for past
couple days so here's a long-term people
serving and price short seller shorting
and if you watched my DVD should never
shorting into those cappers without
resistance and if it's super low flow
and once they started perking right here
and break this morning high 524 and
that's where it is super important to
recognize and you don't need to change
the strength you can buy the pull backs
and risk the open price and most likely
auto load flow stocks they hold respect
really well and I did long from here I
didn't have her in my chat room because
I don't like they were quote unquote a
pumping the stock so I typically don't
want to go long super low flow don't
really alert but I did now from a five
point four ish and soul into the seven
and I went all the way to 20 so I didn't
really chase and the current get some
shears sure so that's as for that day
and yesterday gapped up pushed and
consolidating this 12:22 range and
dumped and right here that's a big
moment is shift so and as you can see
today negative thirty five percent and I
did short in the nineteenth cover into
the twelfth and I'll be verifying my
trades later and that's for GDL
so AC ASTC yesterday had a huge gap up
and if you read here to statistics
all those super gay pups they do have
average effect in person age before they
come down so once you're tracking nap
tailor switching exactly know where they
can expect you it showed a first right
there and now when the stock drops
already half of its own spike
it's really hard to come down to the
next day and I wouldn't be suggesting
shorting tomorrow and I think this stock
it's probably through asking gear and
prices kind of studying volumes fading
and the price to getting neutralized and
I mean KD and this stock
marriage news and I don't know what's
going on in this chart so I don't touch
anything with merge has gapped up four
hundred sixty percent without any volume
there's no the qualities I stay away
from and he can't recess into as well so
a ETI
or so I was tempted to shorting this
1.75 and I turns out didn't cover into a
one point five nine and then inspect
again and finally died didn't have
enough patient on this one but uh the
direction was right so pretty happy
about it and for other stuff like people
are asking me what does tier 1 and tier
two and Tier three offer I'm just going
to give you just a brief idea
so Tier II won't come with a chatroom
and I will be in my chat room every
single day to before the Markey open
will give you my thoughts and give you
my priority of the stocks where you need
to focus on one stock has the best
winning percentage and and third to come
with a statistics that I build a
platform that not a problem pure
statistics data base to track each
panelist winning percentage then you
will get another monthly report will
basically show you
the detail of this pattern and when you
need to take your entry when you need to
take your exit to maximum your profit so
it's all down by many means not
automatics so those took a lot of work
and I am pretty sure none of the other
people offers that basically I use
historical data to create patterns and
if you can plant this pattern you have a
decent winning percentage that's called
our edge you have statistics to back you
up so now to Tier three is basically you
will get everything that I offer and I
will give a webinar Thursday morning so
live trading and you will also get a
sound a lecture so I basically go over
ring the wiki trades and if you have any
questions you can ask me and you can
also swim your account statement I can
go over your trades and give you my
personal opinion and what you need to
improve and other stuff so that's
basically the brief explanation for
three or two tiers tier 1 tier 2 and
tier 3 and I think that's about it so
that beer for guys
if you liked the video click the like
button and if you see haters please help
me to make them stay away so thank you
very much you guys have a great day

three it's already open so make sure
check it out and there there's also a
coupon code just go ahead and review the
website and I feel interested go ahead
and subscribe to you well which Tyrion
you're you're interested so there's two
plays that happen today I trade CDTI
and SNES so there's been crazy volume
purposes for the past couple of days as
is traded about 50 to medium volume 52
million shares today and you can see
it's very very heavy crowded in the
morning and shorts got squeezed actually
when I think they're tempdata shorting
to this 1.5 area and this specific place
when you see the
stocks of heavy traded you have to be
you have to be really careful not
getting squeezed because you have to cut
your losses if you look at the long-term
chart there is no ceilings the stock is
actually the first time trading with
this kind of insane volume so be really
careful with those charts and I did
hammered at the shore tip more decent
size in that 1.7 area covered in 1.25
and metalloids are alerted in real-time
image item so all the trades idea eating
in the chat room and also see the tii
shortly around this 1.4 area looking for
that after afternoon fade and turns out
to be the perfect afternoon fade I
covered in one dollar ish so that's
about 40% again I think it's about 20 or
25 percent yen so very solid trade today
and I also want to talk about recent
squeezes that happened a couple weeks
ago I think a cop I'm beyond okay
but I didn't call as bad I attempted
sure the first green day cut it my loser
[Music]
once it turns back closing the 4/10 so
last about couple thousand there and
hammered big size in this perk 5.4 eh
risking that 5.5 ish last about and I
think 15,000 and I showed her into this
perk got my money back and I never seems
to trust it they stopped because every
time you hit stop for area bounces right
back so then you release earnings and
stuff and went all over to a point five
and I stopped reading the sticker and
haven't traded since then
and there's so many place happen
recently so yeah it's not really my
focus but I see people losing on bianche
same thing don't ever short on the first
screen day and don't hammer in something
that doesn't have resistance so if the
if the chart does have resistance I'm
I'm more comfortable
hammering more size into it but with a
stock trading with heavy volume and no
ceiling
I will never hammer in something like a
hundred thousand two hundred thousand
shares or not diabetic fifty fifty
thousand shares into it so make sure be
really careful and sell your risk really
close to your stop really close to
whatever the sucker truly am without the
ceilings because those things can
potentially blow up your account very
very easily so be careful with shorting
and see other things I need to talk
about fwp will be a play tomorrow oh it
looks like it doesn't have any
resistance in the name the chart so we
have to see how it plays out it's not a
low flow it's not a low cap and will
really depends on how they opens
tomorrow if it opens cap or cap gap down
well sir need to watch how it reacts
when the market open other than that I
won't I can't predict if the stock is
gonna go up or down so trade by the
reaction and don't ever try to predict
trades and Bo in case examples and I'm
pretty sure there's another one I'm
pretty sure yeah SNES is example two a
lot of people were shorting that one
saying went all the way to the twos so
you're down 100% on your shorts and you
can't really get out and after hour
because there's no leak really there
so this is the same my technical chart
just like I dxg I think it was two years
ago so make sure to check your place and
know exactly what you're doing I know
what kind of pattern you are trading
please have an edge I don't want to see
people blow up their accounts and get
your risk level really really tight good
luck tomorrow and if you are interested
to the chat room it's already here
there's a lot of people like it and if
you do want to try it out just try it
out one more one more steer one and see
what do you think about the largest in
chat room and other than that you guys
have a great day and thank you very much

so I had the first Green Day follow with
the second day I think I traded on the
second day this is a reverse split chart
I believe all the previous resistance do
not count it happened in May 1st at its
push there were no par resistance
because it did a reverse split going
into the second day which is on Monday
sing around N9 into the push probably
into the six it was a small trade about
20K 20 to 30k shares overall the flow
was really small so I was being very

hello guys david dexter welcome to this
video and today i'm gonna go over my 21
year performance
so hopefully you guys can learn
something new and this year has been
really crazy and for how much money i
made i'm not going to say
but i'm gonna
you know talk about my three zero
statements which i made about
close to 3.7 million dollars along this
year
and uh
i'm gonna go through different tickers
and go through how many times that trade
per day so which most of you guys are
very curious about
if you're just a beginner
get into this industry so other than
that yeah let's get into the video and
make sure hit that like button
so in 2021 uh
as you can see
uh total summary made about 3.68 million
this is not including the borrowed fees
the borrow fees are probably around 300
to 400 000 so net profit will be
anywhere between three to 3.2 million uh
it's not that bad if you are comparing
to 2020 which is another
crazy year
it's going into 20 january
made about 2.8 million so
i did i would say i saw the improvements
on my risk management
you can see that i had four red mounts
january march
uh september
and november i shouldn't took this
massive i would say massive mistake it
was it's not a big loss but definitely
missed a lot of opportunities there last
year in november
so
which i did a significant improvement
in this year
as you know that the december in 2021 is
pretty slow so i only made 127 000 but
overall i did really well
and i only had three red month april
june and september
uh april losses are really minimum so
which i'm glad
and uh
this is just profit and i'm going to
dive into specific tickers so this is
how i really manage my risk and you guys
can take my decent notes on it i've been
improving on year by year so i'm still
working on it and i'm still learning i'm
not
graduated from the market yet so as i
keep learning i will share more
experience about how i really manage my
risk but as for now let's dive into the
tickers
so as you can see then there is an
entire page let's see
that's 94. so i traded 94 takers in
total in 2021
and
if you count all the trading days i
trade probably once every three days
between hot and slow seasons so i don't
trade every single day as you can see
four overall if you took look at my
biggest losses and my biggest scan
they're pretty similar and i'm trying to
keep my biggest skin and biggest losses
up to an even level so
if you have a solid
70 winning percentage you you will
always come out ahead
so
asag this is probably the biggest
mistake i made i traded about three
times in a row uh each time lost about
one hundred thousand
uh it was a low flow
gap up short definitely over traded my
mistake um i learned a lot from it but
never sizing too much into a ticker on
my first green day on gap up short not
really worth it this is where i was
testing my limitations of
how much you can size in
in the first green day and
i definitely oversized learned the
lesson from that and i never made the
same mistakes again so this is at the
beginning of the year
amc uh
this i made about three trades on it uh
so if you look at the tickers this is
how much
in total i lost this one i tried about
three times on the way up each time i
lost about sixty thousand
uh sixty thousand ish so
in total plus the fees it comes out at
230.
uh
that's the i think the major loss you
can see the eight thousand eighteen
thousand
uh there's another one 268 000
lost 163 000 loss
so one two
uh
let's see
three
four five
uh yeah those are the five biggest
losses that i have
throughout the entire 2021 all the rest
of the trades will be under 100 000 loss
and you can see
all those winning trades uh 120k 30k
240k 100k
uh 284 thousand so 331
and compared to koss which will be
284 thousand
those are pretty similar
those are thirty thousand apart and my
biggest win plus the biggest losses uh
is
pretty much didn't have zero it's hard
control to
331 losses and thirty three hundred
thirty one gains uh because stocks react
different and they are low floats so
it's hard to
keep them
exactly even but i get my point
so
overall
uh did pretty well this year
and
uh let's look at some of the losses uh
together so you guys can kind of get my
point of why sets then
and
why is it not a good idea to settle in
too much and place over
to trade in the same ticker in the same
day so for aacg this is where i made my
mistake
you can see that i was betting on this
gap up short it pushed up to the 570s
and get a fake out right here
i don't know why you can zoom in
um
then you pull it back down so this is
where i shorted it and it reversed again
um pushed up
uh broke through the five ninety five
seven areas that's where i cut my losses
so i did one two launches right here
because they have multiple fake outs
and they're not fake out so all of those
mouses plus together each of them is
100k because i sized in i think was
seven hundred thousand so each time i
was taking
uh seven percent eight percent
yeah
ten percent losses each time so
that's where i took the massive losses i
didn't even get caught by this huge
run-up
so
overall
lessons from taking this
specific losses
whenever you're looking at the gap
offshore if it goes over 300 it's not
really worth it to shorting to it that's
number one number two if it performs
over three times on the fake out
uh if you screw up two times on the
trade do not ever trade it again this is
where i made my mistake i could minimize
this to a 200k losses
but instead of 300k
so
this is where i could improve on in the
future is i could not touch this one
because it's up 300 already
and i screwed up over three times on the
sticker so i could minimize it to a 200k
i could just not trade the sticker at
all from the
first criteria so
and every single year i will look at the
tickers and where i made the mistakes
and to really revalue
uh
is this mistake avoidable
how can i place a criteria for myself to
see
okay this is not treatable in the next
time so
now for some tickers you can see uh you
says in too much it's not really
avoidable that's fine uh just take out
all the things that's not necessary uh
especially
the traits that you forced in um so
that's something that i personally do
for myself every single year i think for
beginners as you guys should do it as
well
so
um
overall you can see my performance right
here and i don't trade that much once
every three days
and every single year make sure look at
your own count statement and find out
all the mistakes that you made
pull out all the mistakes that it's not
necessary and write down the mistakes
that's
that can be avoided
in the future so in this way you can
improve yourself every single year
the main thing about this game is
keep your
max loss and your max win up to the same
level as long as you have a solid
winning percentage you will always come
out
in a year
so i still
couldn't
manage my
um
wins to
massively overwhelm my max losses i
think it comes out every single year and
i'm still trying to improve on that so
as trader
as myself as you guys we're all
improving ourselves so if you have any
comments leave a comment below if i also
have any questions you can also ask me
in the comments as well
and
that'll be the end of this video make

time when there's a massive panic what's
up guys Stephen Baxter welcome to my new
video lessons of the week and that today
we're gonna talk about only play for a
week that is a WX and this ticker had
really really high-skilled manipulations
I start from Monday I think stock was up
training and third morning spike squeeze
back up and dump when short-circuits
squeezed and keeps grinding up and start
with the cap Hopson every single morning
start with the morning panic squeeze
back slow grind gap up morning panic
squeeze come back down then slow grind
now this time because it's Friday so
this short squeeze when really really
insane you went from six to fourteen in
a matter of a couple hours and after
hour I'm looking to shorting into either
Monday or Tuesday and maybe even
Wednesday because this one has gone one
of the highest supernovae in history so
I went on to 220 in about four five days
and every single day it's about this
Green Day so this ticker it is very very
overextended and from what I see for now
on Monday because there's a gap up and
of course getting that 200% it's really
really rare for this stuff to turn red
so I would say there's probably a high
conservation on Monday most people will
be trading on this ticker on Monday it's
probably caught a lot of attentions in
this after hour spike and I'm looking
forward to you see these ticket rates of
maximum volume in the next coming days
and I can use that volume as a volume
rocker resistance to short into and this
is one a play that doesn't happen that
often happens few times of the year so
trillion those tickers have to be really
really careful either get squeezed like
that or you can make profits like gbr or
gr make seventy thousand one hundred
thousand dollars on one ticket or in one
day so the key is to control your risk
and when you see something that is not
right get out because on those specific
tickers you don't need to catch the
whole realm up you don't need to catch
the whole downtrend all you need to
catch is some portion of it because the
profit range is so big it doesn't really
matter if you catch the whole thing you
because portion portion of it it is
going to be really big profit that is my
thought process on a double X as I
mentioned couple days ago and there is
weird strange level to actions not
happening a table X so massive bit comes
every single time when there's a massive
panic
same thing with Friday panic I saw the
momentum start shifting dropping from $8
to 6 and it turns out to be massive bit
again and squeeze not to 30 once you
start breaking out this 8rh area it
becomes full bullish again and don't
really want to long into Friday
afternoon because I don't want to get
dumped right before people start exiting
and turns out to be another supernova
that's overall chart looking like
insisting Green Day every single day
volume is not that big I'm looking to
see more volume coming in that's going
to be more and more difficult to either
manipulating the stock or pumping the
stock whatever you want to call it the
more volume traded and the more block
will be selling to you and the more
batteries will be in the stock and I'll
create a show up to knees into next
coming days
hopefully this lesson is really really
helpful don't get too confident
be careful trading this ticker and you
don't need to catch top you don't need
to catch the bottom just get a portion
of it and you'll be good to go that is
the key of trading on those really
overextended ticker and that would be
here for today and also in the last
video lessons if you are interested in
in person teaching I will be in LA as
our first private lessons so if you are
going to register I will put a link
underneath register up in there and you
will be good to go
and we only accept 20-25 people if the
spot is full you have to go in to wait
until the next year so now be off today
thank you very much and you guys have a
great day

what's all that still knocks here huh
today we're gonna go over the weekly
recap of July and we're gonna talk about
three tickers that happened this week
they're pretty crowded and I don't give
my thoughts on it and let's get into it
so CTR v KR n and M L and T those are
three tickers that was majorly traded
this week I'm a Bunty and this one was
actually got really really crowded
during a pre market he was trading
around five million shares in the
pre-market and if you take a look of
this morning spike because I can tell a
lot of shorts got squeezed on this first
green day because the thing that they
don't understand is when Assad starts to
get crowded the price action start to
hold multiple times we cannot show the
into it because all the killing gear is
gonna slow grind and squeeze you slow
going to squeeze you again and by the
end of the day you're down huge in the
second day there's a huge gap and you
got or you perforce cover or whatever so
that's not very good idea avoid trades
I was super crowded if I was trading for
tea medium or plus or intraday now let's
talk about wrong so and this ticker you
can't go wrong because now on this
specific can though if you take a look
of 1013 and turn away those two candles
considered to be bearish candles and
when the stock is bouncing when in stock
also does a bearish candle after the
huge panic into a balance most of the
time if the stock is now crowded that
candle will fail in this case to stop
hell dude pretty much two times I trade
a huge amount of volume at one point two
million and also there's a huge stuff I
mean 10:47 held again so I don't
understand people are still shorting it
because there's a couple stuffing
actions he held perfectly
Lansing does this breakout people
you got squeezed so over all mistakes
starts from here if you are seeing of
crowded trades
even though did a huge panic into your
bounce and he held three times or plus
don't really go along anymore
you can't go small on the round but
don't try to go short so then I think I
made a mistake don't try to go short
turn in the morning after the panic if
it's a crowded trades
yeah after that the stock first a huge
support underneath so the reason why I
didn't really show our email and tea is
because if you take look most
consolidation ended around sixth hour
area then after market open now there is
a tons of people that bought five or six
dollar area sellers a tons of resistance
as well no as you can see there's a tons
of volume traded around five to six
tower area so when step pulls back
there's a whole lot of support going on
so I can't really tell where is the
support and that's why I didn't short
into it well turns out stuff faded and
also right here if you short after first
birthday now this is the criteria if you
wanna show interest rate that is because
if we are plenty short
using the first Rayleigh pattern first
first where that needs to be finished
very very weak so this one does qualify
the pattern but if you take a look at
all those charts and the stop and pull
already 50% and there's also tons of
support in the factor sixth hour area
it's also scroll grind so if you're not
kind of tell where the support is is
around actually starting from 4 to 6 so
you can really tell and well first the
start of draw to 50% already that's not
enough reward if you're using first a
pattern to shorting to second
there's tons of support underneath you
can really tell where is the support so
those two factor pass together and it's
not a really a first-rate a short
pattern unless every pushes again into
the $67 area and still would even surely
and because the neutral area sorry 5 so
really have them with risk/reward and
interracial around 7:00 I will have to
cover at 5:00 always think about what
the stock for does and what is the risk
reward after your assumption think
through that first make a judgment after
that and krn this ticker was very very
strange was a hundred meeting cap I
didn't really trade it because the stock
is not really behaving very very normal
and it bears only a little amount of
shirts being traded at heart
well surely up I think around three
miniatures and took the stock from like
twenty two for a dollar
and during the morning the stock did got
stuffed I was planning to short but
since it doesn't really qualify any
patterns when I go into a trade I always
asked myself what kind of pattern my
trading now in this case I can really
find and I think a parent can really use
it according to and I don't have a
resistance to even risk at all the only
thing a pig is like the morning morning
panic and shorting to the sponsor risk
in the top but doesn't recall has any
pattern also very very low liquidity and
that's why I didn't really show didn't
you
that's what K Yaran are you sure that
congrats if you didn't I think it's a
good habit to avoid those very very
strange ticker now CTR V this ticker
super low flow when a stock does a
morning panic and you already lost 50%
of the entire pre market game typically
stock doesn't really push anymore it's
just straight diet that's why I didn't
really short into it if you want to go
long after market open the pre market
strength has to be very very steady you
cannot be making those panics before the
market open because when the stock does
a panic in the morning and already lost
fifty percent people will lose help and
they will not tend to buy the ticket
anymore number two when people are
reciting a pre market and they're down
20% after market open what do we do is
the owner selling to push once it does
push and to push will get destroyed
because the people are assessing in
premarket into a breakout i wants to get
out so two of those situations that you
don't really want
go long when the star lose its 50% in
the pre-market that's overall for those
three takers hopefully it's helpful
hopefully you can use analysis into
future tickers as well you have
questions leave a comment below and we
have upcoming conference in August so
you can watch me lab tray and talk about
your train journey you're welcome to

be tickers that the money that's being
redistributed into those High flows that
has resistance that's her opportunities

and make a tons of money if you're a

throughout this year I want to make sure
that whenever you see a very crowd of
tickers in the Prem Market trades over
20 million you do want to avoid it
throughout the day and you can come back
in the next day to short because the
volume is not enough to support the
previous day volume to continue to go up
or it gaps down can use over gap down
pattern that'll be much safer way to

SOURCE VIDEO: Should Beginners Trade Low Float Stocks？ [iujSU4k7I7Y].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys steven dux here welcome to
this youtube videos and today we're
going to talk about how to really trade
micro floats
and also giving you the two latest
examples that happened
last week generally for microflow i do
not recommend the beginners to trade
this type of taker
in here i'm going to give you a couple
tips of how to really react
and also cutting losses if you're stuck
in a microfloat
before i start this video make sure to
click the like button and subscribe
and let's get into today's taker so
when you are looking at a ticker that
doesn't really have
any type of history there is no volume
no price range was created
in the historical chart all of the
standard stock is gaining
50 million volume in a day and also
10 million volume pre-market and stock
opened
traded about 10 million shares or 16
million shares
when we're looking at volume estimates
we are
using the pre-market volume or the first
hour volume to estimate the entire day
total volume for acy stock is definitely
going to trade much more volume
but if you take a close look at how much
range you can drop from eight dollar
area which is the pre-market resistance
so it started to spike around three
maximum reward will be anywhere between
four to five
so if the stock is going to trade more
volume but it's
only going to have minimum reward and
that is
not very ideal for microflow at all
definitely it's going to create more
range for acy
specifically that day i did not place
any type of trade in there
because i do know that stock is going to
trade more volume
which i cannot predict how far it's
going to go
and also it's not worth it for me to
shore into a really tight range
with a microflow stock so acy did the
breakout
a lot of people are shorting acy as well
stock went from
6 to 38 without any type of pullback
in this case if you are shooting a flow
that is under 2 million it's considered
a microflow
to cut your losses especially when the
stock reaches your
maximum risk don't wait for a pullback
don't wait for any type of
potential red candle just cover your
shares in market order
that's personally what i do all the time
and you can keep me safe
from ear to ear and the major mistakes
come from that you're waiting for a push
on a microflow and that's where you take
a huge loss so
acy the only way to trade this uh
potentially can ensure around the 28
bounds but that's the stock already
dropped about 75 percent
from the top so let me explain why
shooting ac one at twenty dollars is not
ideal let's look at the tickers that
happened
last month so wnw uh
let's look at the intraday charting
behavior stock
went parabolic in the morning it dumped
from 160 to 72
that's pretty much dropped over 50 from
the top
but you can see this instant recover
from the bottom and consolidated
and then dropped from there now the
difference between acy
and wnw wnw is a natural reaction from
the retail traders trying to dip buy and
sell at the top
acy is completely different it got
halted because
there was no news and the hulk is a t1
hole
not a volatility hole the difference
between
volatility hole and t1 hull t1 hull
generally has pending news and when the
news generally comes out it's either an
offering
or they say they have no news that's
when the stock dropped 75 percent from
the top
volatility ho is completely different
than t1 home there's
just stock is trading way too fast and
also it's producing way too much range
that's when the stock gets halted about
five to ten minutes depending on
the exchanges so in this case t1 is a
much severe case
for the stock to drop from the top and
generally they don't really come back
so for acy i had a t1 hole
once the t1 hole finishes then the stock
never recovered
same thing goes to yuu this is also a t1
hulk
dropped never recovered but when it's a
volatility hole
if the stock drops 50 it has a high
chance for the stock to come back
then drop into the next day so make sure
have a clear understanding of which halt
it is
to change your trading strategy another
thing
that you can take advantage of trading
microflow
is the higher the price of the stock
the less shares that investors can buy
so
let's say i have one thousand dollar and
the stock is at one dollar
i can buy one thousand shares but if the
stock is at one hundred dollars i can
only buy ten shares
so the higher the price of the stock the
less shares i can buy
that means the stock is going to become
a much bigger flow because i cannot
purchase
that many shares that applies to every
single retail
investors so in this case if the stock
goes to 100 to 200
there's not going to be enough demand to
satisfy the supply and in that way the
stock is likely to either gap down
or have some type of hope and stock
drops will be present from the top
the third point is looking for a
consolidation to show the stock
either is on day two day three never
show on the first green day
never try to show into a parabolic no
matter how high
the gaining percentage it is so for
example acy went from
6 to 38 the stock was up about 1
300 percent people generally will use
that gaining percentage
let's say the average gaining percentage
for microflow will be 300
to 500 percent and people will use that
as a guide to show it into
but especially for stocks like acy wnw
they're both performing a parabolic in
the morning and nobody
can ever tell where it's going to stop
in this case
always wait for consolidations or just
not traded at all
for wnw it did have some type of
consolidations for it to risk off
but the overnight fee was way too
expensive for all the conditions i just
said
that microflow is not worth it for you
to trade first of all
that the spread between ask and bid is
way too far that you're going to get a
really bad execution
second generally most of the microflow
the borrow fee is
extremely expensive especially holding
overnight it's pretty much impossible
the
overnight fee will basically take all of
your profits
trying to hold a microflow overnight and
also your risk
is pretty large because manipulators can
easily move a microflow 20 dollars in
one candle
in the pre-market so there's going to be
two conditions that you can ensure into
a microflow
first of all that stock is running on
day two or day three and you shorted
into your consolidations the second
point that you can do
is wait for first thread day those are
the two
only methods you can take advantage for
a microflow
but never try to jump into the first
screen day it is completely
not worth it from my personal trading
performances
that i always give back all my gains
from microflow by the end of the year
so by the end of the day that you will
never make
a dollar from trading microflow make
sure stay away of the stocks that flow
is under 2 million
and if you really want to trade it make
sure look for consolidations and
size and small so that will be end of
this video thank you very much for
watching i will see you guys

SOURCE VIDEO: Should You Trade IPO stocks？ Day Trading [3TnhlLl7Erc].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys steven dux here welcome to
this new youtube videos
and today we're going to focus on the
strategy that was
producing uh for the entire decembers
and for the last two weeks we're pretty
much playing with
ipo related stocks so today i have
summarized three things you guys can
focus on
uh when you are trading this type of ipo
related stocks
so before i start this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
let's get into today's content so the
first thing
you want to remember is ipo is called
initial public offering
and it's basically the first day that
stocks appear in the stock market
and you will have its own float brand
new market cap
a lot of people are trying to get into
the stocks in the first day
so it makes the first green day
untreatable
pretty much throughout the entire day so
let's look at the tickers called wnw
that happened the last week pretty much
all tickers have
high volume low flow it's going to
behave very similar to wnw
let's try to look at the entire action
and to see what we can learn from it
so wnw uh initial public offering
has started around seven and so right
now
the price for w w is 75
normally to calculate the initial market
cap i will use
how much it gained from seven so again
over a thousand percent
and we're using uh the overall market
cap and 75 dollar divided by 10 because
it gained
10 times over then seven so uh
initial market cap we can calculate from
1.88 billion
divided by 10 that's around 188 million
in terms of initial market cap so once
we calculated
uh the initial market cap will be 188
million and the flow
is under 20 million so it's considered a
low flow
the amount of volume we've been getting
i will get into that into the second
point
so let's look at the first green day as
i said
a lot of people trying to get in pretty
much make it untreatable
shares are not available some shares
were available
by the late of the day that's because
the stock is brand new so there's not
enough supply
out there for you to really get it
except your hedge fund on the second
green day
this is a really tricky part the stock
dropped in the pre-market
and they force the stock to go into
short sale
restriction so basically it makes it
much harder to short
and also brings tons of trap for short
sellers to fall in
so uh the first resistance that was
considered to be
a pre-market resistance it was around
1.05
and i do see a lot of people trying to
use 105
as risk to short into the stock
but let's reverse back to the point i
want to make
about volume so when you are trying to
read
ipo volume you have to read in terms of
volume times the average price it's
because
during the normal market conditions that
the stock
can go up to 65 a share or 85
a share is very difficult is because the
stock is way too expensive
for normal investors to buy so in this
case
we're using the small volume times the
average
price to calculate how much actual
dollar was being traded
into this taker so let's look at the
five-day chart whenever you are looking
at ipo stocks
there's no historical chart and it's
pretty much only two or
in terms of historical chart so we want
to look at december 17th
we traded around three million shares
and the consolidation is
anywhere between 120 to 140.
so let's pick the middle of the
consolidation let's use 120 120 times
3 million you traded overall 360 million
in terms of amount of dollar that was
traded in that day
the third point i want to point it out
is once you know how much dollar was
traded in that day you will know that
if the volume is actually sufficient or
not because
if the stock trades over 300 million in
one day then the stock itself becomes
shortable in terms of
liquidity and you don't have to worry
about you can't really exit and your
size is going to affect the stock price
so the total three point will be
uh try not to trade on the first green
day because
there is a lot of volatility hope second
i will be
make sure to spot the correct market cap
and float
and the third one was the stock proof
itself that is tradable
uh make sure focus on your risk reward
it is very important
because the maximum reward normally
lands from
50 to 75 maximum so that will be of the
three points i want to cover today
make sure leave a question below i
understand that the third point is a
little bit confusing
so if you have any questions uh make
sure to leave a comment below i will see
you guys in the next one

so what's up guys Stephen Dexter I
haven't really done a video about recent
stocks recently and I'm going to do a
recap of November and especially for the
last week with a lot of players recently
and we had a SPS TV and sys those are
the major players that happened last
week so there's a lot of key points that
was involved because there's a lot of
different patterns are involved as well
and some of the key points you need to
avoid and this video is going to be a
little bit more educational and are
talking about market caps and overall
patterns and before I get into this
video make sure to click the like button
and subscribe if you have any questions
please leave a comment below and they'll
reply to you as soon as I can and that
is getting to the video so PS TV this
one was a semi bound sure if you take a
look at this one month's chart the stock
did have some type of resistance
back in October 15th when your chart I
think was right here now the overall
resistance is not that much around 7
medium so dollar resistance will be the
volume times the price which is 7
million times 535 million dollar
resistance now let's take a look of
wooden stop data born in panic and
decides to spike in fatal all day
overall
the stock is barely out 50% so it's not
ideal about sure I do about sure would
be minimum of 50% now in this case I did
sure into a three point three dollar
area and the covered half into 95 into
60 overall it's a decent trade didn't
really sizing that much because it's not
a perfect pattern to play with now next
time when you see it every single time
we're looking at ticker and you want to
stop to form resistance first before you
really try to short into resistance
let's said psdb the historical
resistance will be three point six and
now for today nobody knows where it's
going to spike now when such start to
form resistance around 316 and the top
will be 340 the stock already told you
the high of the day will be 340
so shorting in to 3:30 and there's a pre
metal resistance which is 340
and historical resistance will be 350 so
there's about two layers of resistance
which that has a decent Asda shoulder
into and that's the reason why short a
PST be and overall made about eighty
cents out of three point three so around
twenty twenty plus percent on this
ticker now let's talk about a IHS this
is more interesting tickers and a lot of
people are trying to figure out how to
really trade especially a ticker like
this relatively high flow over to behind
my cab super crowded volume so when you
are looking at take care if the volume
is over thirty million per day it's
considered to be a crowded ticker
I mean means the stock is very crowded
and the stuff tends to get that high
about 150 percent start running into you
about 109 100 ten and the style pushed
about twenty to thirty percent so when
you're trading a stock make sure to pay
attention to the stock price if the
stock are really close to one dollar is
difficult for you to trade especially
going long or short the reason behind it
is a stock has to be at one dollar or
above to meet an asset requirements to
be able to stay on an exact if the SAP
tends to go down below one for a long
period of time they will get you this
data often on staff so people tends to
hire market makers to manipulate their
stocks to be able to stay above one and
they can either do offering your reverse
split to make your stock price go higher
and for a IHS if we are showing very
close to $1 the odds for you is not
going to be that well especially when
the stock consolidated around 135 and
broke down this entire support around $1
area now in most scenarios stuff tends
to lose more but just look at the ticker
you start held at one dollar perfectly
by the end of the day so into the next
Monday prop just I probably will still
hope that one daughter as well and this
is the reason why always tends to avoid
shorting the stock is if it's too close
to one daughter that's for a IHS let's
talk about and sys now this ticker had
extremely low flow if you look at it the
ticker doesn't really have any type of
resistance no historical any type of
historical ball
been trading on this ticker for a while
so when the stock is a fresh chart never
tried to size a name to weaknesses
don't sass into the bounce only setting
to mass strains or when the stop tends
to lose its always again after broke
down the major consolidations so the
only odds will be into this breakdown
showing around it's a little bit low but
shooting under 490 and be able to swing
into the next day cover around 385 or
390 so still about a dollar a
risk/reward around 20% for beginners I
don't really suggest shooting in the
morning showing the afternoon shooting
to midday the only thing I would really
recommend is wait until the stock
concerts for a while from arrived amount
of resistance then ensure after the
breakdown even though it's a little bit
low but it does give you a decent risk
reward and also give you a really high
20% with a decent resistance to risk off
so one of the last tip I want to give
out is when you are looking at any type
of tickers or any type of companies make
sure take a look of their market caps
the market caps are really important
there's large travelers make a very
small caps and a large cap will be
considered as 500 million or a bug or
billion dollar above those are
considered billion dollar companies and
they are really hard to drop they're
really hard to go up so the volatility
for those type of companies are really
low which is 2 to 5 percent every single
day now maybe sometimes you get a good
news then you get a 20% 30% move but
it's more like in your instance so you
can't really catch the action after that
will be anywhere between 200 million to
500 million that's considered as a
mid-calf
so in make have the stock does have some
type of fundamentals so for start to
drop and it's really good for Dubai when
they're doing like a massive volatility
flipping either Long's or short dip
buying into panic shown into math
parabolic those works really well now
for small caps need to be really careful
we are trying to go along these type of
market caps because those type of
companies fundamentals are really bad
now we are trying to go long into this
type of taker never try to hold
overnight now take a look at the sticker
aptn
Samson take a look at the market a bit
so it's under 20 million which is
extremely small cap and for these type
of tickers so we're not trying to go
along never try the whole overnight see
something like this if you go along at
Tony you'll be selling at 4 and that's
about 80% below your entry if you're a
beginner understanding the market caps
are really important we already
especially buying large on these APD and
that gains about three three hundred
percent 100 percent
there's ok to buy if you have a decent
statistics to support entry day long
intraday short but that's only for in
two days never try the whole overnight
to try to risk of this potential
offering I fell trying to beit's going
to get pub if it does offering it's
gonna go to four you are losing too much
it's okay to buy mid cap or bigger cats
because they do have some type of
fundamentals to be able to hold the
stock better compared to all those
stickers that have really extremely low
small caps understand the reason why
smoke caps that's offering our time is
because they need money they need money
for their projects they need money for
their company because the reason why
they get into the market is they need
money from the investors and generally
those companies are 90 percent lack of
cash or they're about to go bankrupt so
they're desperate for potential
investors and that's all the tips for

[Music]
welcome to this video uh so for this
video we're gonna do a recap for the
current rounders that's been happening
in the last one or two weeks and as you
notice that the market is kind of losing
its liquidity and a lot of tickers are
pretty much dropping without any type of
volume so in this type of Market
environment we want to focus on uh how
to really size in with the correct size
and also to be really careful with you
know getting stuck with really low
liquidity and getting short squeezed
into
um into a hole because the liquidity is
really low so normally you see the
spread is pretty large so that will be
the main focus for today and other than
that we have a new content that's been
going to be released in February so the
pre-sale is on right now it's going to
be a really short time to get a discount
and make sure to check the link below
and let's get into the video
so today we have a pgy IV and ampx those
are the three ticker zaps being running
kind of rounding the last couple days uh
ampx this is one of the IPO Runners
typically when you see an IPO Runners
they do around several days whenever
they are performing consistently down
trending uh whenever you see that pretty
new IPO within six months and it's been
downtrend in the last month or two and
the first green day typically follow
with the second Green Day that's the
typical IPO Runners and as you can see
that majority of the first Green Day
held pretty well and did a large squeeze
into into the clothes and today there
there wasn't any volume in the
pre-market so it had some type of
consolidations today so this will be a
potential tomorrow overall it's not up
that much roughly about 50 percent so 50
of this and since the market is pretty
low it's all criticizing into into this
consolidations risking a little bit but
not worth the size at all if you
borrowed
with I would say pretty expensive borrow
fees then you can set a little bit to
make it back
that's for ampx we have PGI this is
another uh one of the tickers that's
been running for a long time and this is
the rough type of motivated Runners you
can see this one went from 70 cents to
7.5 it went up about a thousand percent
but when I finish it running it didn't
really trade High liquidity only it's
pretty much neutralizing in a seven six
dollar area and the way I mean
neutralizing is the stock is not trading
any type of volume and it's not going
anywhere so typically when the stock is
neutralizing it's not forming a
resistance it's basically that the
buyers and sellers are meeting in the
agreedable price certain period amount
of time so if there's not much volume
being traded that means not many people
are purchasing and selling in the same
price that does not trap enough back
holders for the stock to drop so for PE
GUI this one slowly faded that's why
when you see the high of the multi-day
runners if they're not trapped enough
volume when they start to fade it's
really difficult to get an entry first
of all the volume is really low so it's
hard to sizing a decent size second ball
is that when it fades the 50 Mark
there's a really high chance for the
stock to bounce back so overall reward I
take several days that means you have to
pay a couple days of borrow fees and
plus interest and also uh the 50 Mark
it's likely to pass really high and they
also don't have enough volume to cover
your shorts so overall
um for shorting on these type of I would
say neutralized multi the runner it's
pretty difficult another I would say a
profitable opportunity that's in the
last two weeks it's mviv this one I
didn't really catch it you had
um a gap Hub after hours
into the resistance
personally I was going to sizing in the
open but
they're offering the pre-market this one
it was heading into resistance around 13
which is right here 32 million
resistance that's about uh 300 million
dollar Block it's pretty good idea and
the float is 1.5 million so it's
worth the trade but it's still micro
flow needs to be careful with the
morning push but this is actually a
decent opportunities for people to catch
but unfortunately it did a
offering uh right before the open so
then there's no way to set into this
sticker but um for those last two weeks
there is probably uh
how's the ideal three takers that's been
I would say tradable
um not worth it to size enough size
except mviv
other than that that'll be the recap for

which trades is necessary to place even

that filter out you know all of the

that's the opportunity that have to
place a uh entry and exit and get rid of
all of the overtrading and what what is
considered not to be tradable then I

let's apply steam that's it this video
is gonna be not a training videos it's
more about my personal life so I'm a
huge Harper and back in 16 I was trading
penny stocks for 15 and it took me about
2 3 4 years to really grind from well I
started with about 27,000 and I turn
into your most for minion now right now
it's probably 5 to 6 million and I used
to have a white LD and this is the new
car
the Ferrari 488 spider
[Music]
while in black
[Music]
so for you guys who don't know me I fair
knew and my name is Stephen ducks people
want to ask me how much you really made
in a pretty stock Mercury there is not
very ideal number sometimes you lose
money sometimes you had a huge amount or
sometimes you just very decent the
biggest month I had was probably five
hundred to six hundred thousand per
month and the worst mother has like
probably two thousand three thousand
back pain I was fifteen or sixteen
Alti trade stocks hard I basically being
full dedicated into this market and took
me probably thousands of hours trying to
master the skill no matter what you do
playing again we're doing whatever you
want to do if you don't really master
eight takes about three to four years so
when going to industry cannot really be
rushing into it if you want to be
successful you have to put the hours and
you have to put the work in nothing
comes really easy so back in around 15
and 16 I used to help out II and I was
dreaming about the half of Ferrari or
Lamborghinis because as a look at the
Instagram and stuff and I see people
having all those fancy cars everybody
wants them and I wanna I'm also a huge
car fan so I don't kind of really find
what is the best way to really make
enough capitals to really afford this
kind of cars so I look at into internet
trying to find yours really stay there's
day trading and for me a college
students I found day trading because
that's the one that needs the smallest
capital and I also find that to be to
get into the industry you have to learn
a lot of course and also involves risk
every business has risk so after about
two years of course that made me sick
surround the way nobody can really
animated a just going full potential and
started turning stuff into millions I
made a couple mistakes of course a lot
of small mistakes as well about two
years I made about two three medians
then I bought my one of my dream cars at
McCarran after two years later I want
the Ferrari instead of the McLaren
because personal preferences now think
of all the things I've came
have studied the cabinet stickers and do
the statistics it took so much work but
by the end of the day I think it's worth
it and nothing can really compared to
that you personally achieved your own
goal and it feels very satisfied here I
wanna give everybody thank you very much
because I have started a YouTube channel
I think was 2 3 years ago and not of
people not just me a lot of people are
staying positive they're giving me
courage to really climb that to really
discover my potential so we here on say
thank you very much it's all stay at
very positive energy and one thing I
want to talk about is if people are
better and you learn from them if people
are probably a little bit lower or
they're still younger they don't have
much experience help them I just don't
like the hey or being jealous and stuff
right now we're trying to help people
I'll be that in the video and I will see

as I talked about in the previous couple
videos there's one concept that I talked
about many times is the higher the
market cap the more difficult for the
stock to create more range in that
specific day so for example let's say
that we have a 100 million market cap
you want it to go up 100% you only have
to input another 100 million into the
ticker for it to go up 100% right but if
you have 1 billion then the stock
requires 1 billion to be input into the
stock for it to spe 100% but that's much
more money compared to uh 100 million so
uh the higher it goes it requires more
money and more money

so Starcraft got you to think about to
to train I guess your mouse click speed
yeah and and you mentioned something
about trader psychology with is buyers
or seller how how does that game help
you start thinking about it that way the
game itself it's very competitive it's
one one versus one so I have a opponent
that's on the opposite on the opposite
of my side yeah and first of all you
have to scout have to guess his strategy
and according to his plan you have to
make defense defense plan if his plan
changes and you got it around then you
lose so it's basically a counter

what's up guys teaming up here so uh
today's gonna be a special day and other
people wants me to talk about statistics
one or two so today I'm can't really
dive into it before I dive into the real
data
I want to talk about all the concepts
that I add into your 36 one or two so a
let me know when I finish this video
comment below I understand it then I
will do a next video about the real data
sheets also of a conference coming up in
New York it's going to be in March 28 29
and 38
if you are a beginner boiler trader it's
suitable for everybody make sure to grab
your area ticket sale right now I think
it's right below the video let's get
into the video so tx-102 is going to be
a little bit difficult if I show you the
data sheets right now you won't be able
to understand at all but let's review
the first one to tisks 101 so if you're
a beginner at first we're tracking
samples right we're finding a pattern
and we're gonna track it for a thousand
two thousand times for the course of
three years once you find the pattern
you are eliminating all the takers that
doesn't really fit the criteria once you
find that you want to segregate the
market tabs into small can make happen
large tab because different margin cap
are floating with different money and
the fourth will be the statistics 102
which the major thing is you want to
find the majority of the bouncing rate
which bigger cats do you have that we'll
talk about this a little bit later in
the video let's get into all those
concepts first once you find the pattern
attractive for a thousand times once you
find a winning percentage segregating
buy them the math gaps so over sync gap
down works on small cap Austin capita
doesn't really work on make at and first
right they do made unmake cap so you
will have all type of strategies or
crossing different market cap zones then
you want to figure out the flow now flow
has its own category as well so there is
a microphone nano float nano flow will
be under one media micro flow will be
under two million two million ten
million will be a little float timing or
above will be not considered as a low
flow okay
now also you're on to really track the
volume as well correlating to the flow
the cap and the pattern as well and
volume will tell you how much daughter
Australia in this specific stock once
you find how much daughter was being
traded then you can use that
to really form a level of resistance
let's say today you traded 10 million
volume actually around $2 or $2 I'm
standing in violence 20 million dollar
trader today and 20 million dollar
consider as a resistance is are bound by
resistance let's say trades are 100
million shares today and trade about $10
that's almost 1 billion resistance then
that's considered as a large resistance
once you find all different type of
resistance once you find all different
type of like resistance median
resistance a heavy resistance then you
can use that you really increasing your
winning percentage as well so right now
I'm going to give you a couple steps
when you are really tapping into
statistics and use all those concepts to
really help you in training journey so
number one you want to find a pattern
that is fairly popular that's considered
first birthday now once you find the
first day you want to pick out all those
samples that happened in the history
there's about I think I have tracked
about 100 to almost 200 first birthday
that had a massive wrong once you find
the first red day you want to segregate
all those samples into different market
cap zones some of them are 20 million
market cap some of them are 200 million
market cap once you divide them into
different pieces
you wanna analysis different taker into
different scenarios
because by the end of the day it all
comes down to executions patterns and
entry and exit so entering the exit I
think is the hardest thing because it
relates to to market experience as well
and a lot of people are very confused
about where should you enter what you
exit it's a lot depends on the chart and
sometimes you have to read the level 2
so for that type of experience you will
actually have to sit in front of
computer and start to read the level 2
actions and October kano is considered
as a stopped candle how much wrong is to
be tracking to that specific candle as
well so I will say all that candlesticks
technique or a bomb technique will
probably play out a 20% of your entire
entry and exit most of it is judged by
pattern and winning percentages once you
find the winning percentage of the
pattern when you really want to grow
your account from like three thousand to
thirty thousand thirty thousand to three
hundred thousand you can really
manipulate it now we present to
your own advantage is because the higher
the winning percentage of the pattern
the more shares or money you can size
going to be able to getting a bigger
profit out of it that's how I did it
when I had a really small account so
let's say that this pattern have a
ninety five winning percentage cross
over the last two years then you have a
three thousand dollar account I can size
it in about 2000 2500 I will take I will
take that five percent losing chance
that says any 1000 to 2000 dollars in my
account now I have to have a maximum
dollar oz which is played and also
played into a spreadsheet because once
you have a bigger account and you wanna
size into different scenarios there is a
specific name especially for putting
stocks because planning stuff sometimes
there's not enough volatility so you
can't really sizing that amount of
shares into a ticker we have a small
town that doesn't really matter but once
you grow into a bigger account then you
have to really track how much share you
have to size in before we can really
starting to affect the stock market so
that's the one that one of the thing is
you never want to affect the stock
market because once you are controlling
the market and all the tickers we are
trading is computation and it's it's
very easy to manipulate and also you
will be really easy to stock in one
stock and because I have a really low
volatility
once the equity dries out and you're
completely stuff so that's the limit for
your sizing you will have a bigger
account with a small County can use our
winning percentage to will increase your
profit and with the pattern that has
lower win percentage you can sassy and
smaller to be able to get some type of
profit out of it let's shrink all those
down a little bit first samples number
one second pattern third winning
percentage fourth you want to find
specific entry in an exit and for your
potential risk award now once you find
this for you want to use winning
percentage to increase your profit
because you can size in your bit bigger
you can use the pattern to filter out
which is a future trade and last is
trying to study as much as possible to
get enough market experience for your
specialty screen time just by watching a
stop going back and forth I'm reading
the specific action on whatever - so if
you understand this video make sure to
comment below I understand
because I can't really dive into
delicious beef
don't understand all those concepts so

hello guys steven dux here welcome to
this video and today we're going to go
over hkd and amtd those two takers have
actually squeezed a lot of people and
also the impatient short sellers and
let's go into those technical analysis
and try to figure out when can seize
anyone can set out and for for this type
of ticker like hkd they are trading
really low volume so it's pretty much
impossible to sizing and size out but
there is sympathy play following along
with it so let's
get into this
topic and before i start this video make
sure smash the like button and subscribe
and let's get into it so we have hkd
amtd right here uh let's go through hkd
first so first of all we have this
chinese stock that's on ipo and after
its ipo it went from basically
uh 10 to 2 600 all right it sounds
pretty ridiculous i have no idea why
nysc didn't really hold uh give it a
t1 or t12 uh let's start from the very
beginning we have it ticker started
spiking around 10 to 70 and normally
after it's ipo after a massive run up
you can short into a push
risking the either the high of the
bounce or the height of the run-up
either you short around 48 or you can
short around 58 risking 75 or
48 risking 53 i would personally choose
48 risking 53
and after it breaks through that 53 area
you should exit your position and take a
pressure loss on it or take a full loss
on it and after that the stock rebreaks
that 70 there's no edge on that so you
don't you cannot dodge the squeeze
from 70 to 188 because there's no
consolidation for the risk into
so following to the next day uh
right here if you take a look at it so
we have a massive run up into uh 260 and
it came back all the way down to 140.
most of the time
stock bounces about 50 to 75 percent
from the bottom right and it
consolidates and fades under there
so
uh if you really want to catch the
momentum you can shorten to your bounces
around 203 or 230 and you have to wait
until consolidation to add a little bit
more
in there and since the query is really
low the spread is pretty huge it's
pretty much impossible to size in and
really did not consolidate the only
consolidation you got is on the high of
the day you want
underneath high of the day and once that
breakthrough that's pretty much no trade
you take a full loss on it and then
following into the next day that it's
testing the consolidation
around 500 area you can see 460-ish once
it breaks for 60 you take a lot of over
there then that's pretty much it for the
sticker there's only about
one bounce one consolidation for it to
risk into all other entries uh if you
show around 1000 it you don't really
have any consolidations
that's how it gets squeezed into 2600
and i see a lot of people making
mistakes on hkd is because first of all
they're using market orders to get an
entry which it's pretty much
not very ideal
uh when we're trading on hkd up into the
2500 the spread is sometimes 300
so as soon as you get in you'll be down
about 20 30 percent uh from a position
and hkd uh has been fading from the top
one uh day by day and i couldn't really
size into it i didn't really get any
type of reward from the downside is
because
the volume is only 50 000 shares a day
so that's impossible it says in but on
amtd this is a great one mtd does have a
very large flow so that's good for
shorting
and and the initial market cap is also
really big so let's go into the
introductory amtd was following hkd but
the flow is way too big so it's
impossible for the retail people to buy
it up
and once
you see the stock formats consolidation
around eight dollars you show around
that
area and i just swoon it down
to the two daughter area but one thing i
want to pay attention into is
for this type of
sympathy play some of the play do follow
them in play since most people can't
really distinguish okay uh why is hkd
going up and the mtd is going down first
of all if they do have very similar flow
yes mtd will follow hkd but one of the
hkd flow i still up to this day i have
no idea but it's trading
like it's a have only 300 k100k flow but
for amtd this one has i believe it's 100
million so
there is dramatic difference
compared to the float on those two
tickers shorting to amtd will be much
safer compared to shorting to
hkd
mtd is the
basically owns 90
of the hkd shares and
in terms of liquidities and spread you
can shore into mtd with a much bigger
reward and also it's much easier to get
an entry so in the future whenever you
see the main play going up significantly
always try to choose the sympathy play
that has the largest flow
as big as market cap as possible
and trading tons of volume so when you
have liquidity and range and
large flow it's much easier to size in
and i have made a decent amount of money
on amtd
so that's pretty much it for those two
tickers hopefully you can get a bounce
shot in the future on amtd the
resistance area and the first
consolidations are around six uh first
one is five then six and eight so the
the first resistance will be around five
uh if we have any type of bounce short
testing up into the five six area that
would be a great short in the future
that'll be all for this recap videos
thank you very much for watching i'll
see you guys in the next one

hello guys steven knox here welcome to
this video so today we're going to go
over several takers that happened in the
last two weeks
and uh yes there's definitely place in
the stock market and it's not as dead as
i thought
it
will be so um let's go over the several
i would say
uh
not normal behaviors from the chart and
what we can profit from from uh
in the current market condition so
before i start this video make sure to
click the like button and subscribe so
we have a conference coming up in july
16 to
and will be starting at 9 00 a.m to 5
p.m if you are interested coming into
the conference and come to see the crowd
and learn about uh how to place trades
and just get the general trade
environment
there will be tickets
on sale
you can click the link below to register
for the tickets other than that uh let's
get into the video so we have nrsn this
is a bank short that happened
i think was on friday
we had a massive resistance back into
eight tested again and filled from there
and we have a lot of tickers that had a
massive green day and tested the second
time then fell from
on the top this one happened on rev and
sidu as we talked about in the last
video
on
june 30th on stock gained about i think
was sixty percent uh barely hit seventy
percent so
when we're looking at tickers that's
around sixty seventy percent that's the
minimum um specking percentages for
bounce short on the intraday level and
normally you want to wait for
a decent push
after open and
as you can see that in the last couple
of months
bouncer
rarely happens and we don't really see
them often
and this is the officially the first one
that appeared in the last couple months
and this one signals that the market is
currently back and we are looking at uh
not enough volume i traded
on these intricate level i think
overall throughout the day traded about
50 to 60 million shares
throughout the day i fitted by the end
of the day so i took a short position
around 4.3
i read it down to 3.8 and it was really
bad range so only made a small gain on
the sticker but
a play is a play and we averaged well in
the last two months we averaged oh well
if we average the play we have
around two to three tickers to trade
with in the last two months so let's go
over um our eu now this one is a
multi-day rounder that happened
two weeks ago
a lot of people was
hyping this one up thinking it's going
to be the next gme and since the
stimulus checks are not there anymore we
had a second test right about here and i
think this one was on friday test again
around the eight dollar consolidation
resistance
uh i the reason why i didn't short into
the spike right here into the
consolidation that's when the volume is
really low when the stock is trading on
really low volume
and it's consolidating especially on
right here
it's considered as a neutralized area so
if a stock treating low volume and
consolidating on a neutralized area and
didn't fade that much from the top
this is considered i was a bully sign
for stocks and tends to become
a secondary breakout and becomes another
you know massive multi-day rounder so i
didn't really take a short position here
and of course you faded all the way to
four and bounced again fit it back to
five
i would say this one would end up like
rdbx uh just a slow fading
yeah so if you compare those two charts
i had a slow bounce right here and fit
it all the way down same thing i think
this would happen
on
rdds so that would be all for going over
the charts
and
rbdx rev
uh artisans about short
and sidu they are they all perform very
similar to each other so in the futures
we are seeing 500 million to 600 million
dollar traded on the consolidation there
might be a chance that we can short into
the consolidation and have a
decent risk the high of the
consolidation uh overall i do think
sizing in into this type of low volume
days is kind of risky because as i said
neutralized area always produce the
highest
periodic spike so i wouldn't recommend
going in you know two hem into the
stickers that'll be my thoughts for all
those stickers if you have your opinion
please leave a comment below thank you
very much for watching i will see you
guys in the next one

================================================

[Music]
hello guys steven dexter welcome to this
video so today i'm going to do two
recaps uh in a row for hkd and mtd uh
mtd will be the sympathy play for hkd as
a chinese
ipo play and also i'll be doing another
video about gme and mc all the meme
stocks all together so um there will be
two sections about in those two videos
of recaps and before i start this video
make sure to click the like button and
subscribe and let's get into it
so let's start with bbby this one
started spike
back in
fourth
and after he did this consolidation
right about here uh around
august 8th and after its gap down once
it breaks through that support that will
be a good short from the 10 to 11 to the
eight dollar edge area it took a couple
days to crack he didn't really crack
down because there were support around
820 and you held the support around 870
and 870 again
it's forming
higher low so eventually you took out
that massive resistance area around 11
50-ish
that's where you start went parabolic
from there
so according to my experience trading
this type of charts meme stocks they
normally get tons of volume
and following by each day after it's
green day
so
every single day you will gain more
volume than the previous day after that
you will see a massive parabolic after
parabolic you will see a decent
consolidation
that's where it favors short sellers
so this is not the first time that we
see
bbby goes up
into a parabolic normally on these type
of meme stocks they trade tons of volume
and so it's pretty liquid you can sizing
as much as you as you want you won't you
will not break the chart pattern
compared to uh
hkd
so since we've been trading this for a
couple of times we have uh identified
some of the solid resistance area on
bbvi
once around 325 went around 30 so i
would
probably choose the round area which
will be 30 area
right now we're around 16.1
so hopefully um
after today's volume we can get a decent
gap up push up to the upper 20s and then
that will be a decent short
and my from my personal device i would
not suggest going to the front side
sizing into the consolidation i would
wait until the consolation breaks down
because these type of meme stocks are
really risky in terms of shorting in the
front side
never try to it into a parabolic when
the stock is going up either short
in the consolidation with really small
size or short
with full size after the breakdown so
on bbby this one will be a very solid
play after amtd so hopefully you can
generate a decent opportunity
and
also if i can catch it live that would
be great
so that be uh bbby this is amc mc is
acting a little bit different compared
to bbby i test that 27.5 area twice
and it's not behaving
that well compared to
the
bed bath and beyond
it's because
first of all when we're looking at mc it
doesn't have uh nearly
enough uh range compared to bpby this
one started spike around four i'll
assume yep six
uh mc started spike around
uh 16 ish
so
this one probably this one's almost
tripled from the bottom imc it's not
even doubling from the bottom
so
in terms of range mc is much worse
compared to bbby and
and we have this massive resistance in
the historical chart around
the 30 the consistent resistance around
35 and one of the top around here which
will be 35 so that 30 area will be the
high of that resistance and if you go
into this resistance chart the
consolidation area is around 28 to 30.
so shortening to 27 it's not that bad
because there's massive resistance but
of course there's no range if there's no
range the stock doesn't drop that much
whenever you see a stock losses momentum
it drops about 20 to 30 percent in of
course in in two days
uh this one only dropped about 20
percent
yep and it's going back and forth and
neutralizing itself
if you compare mc and bwi
uh bbby definitely has much more reward
compared to msc so
i would focus on
the momentum shift on the
bed bath and beyond
um hopefully you can get a decent
consolidation and we can get a solid
breakdown on this sticker and this one
will immediately come down i don't think
it's going to surpass
that massive resistance around 30.
okay so that'll be
uh the meme stock and also we have
another one which will be megl a lot of
ipo tickers that's currently spiking
they have no historical chart no
resistance or whatsoever and when they
trade really
low volume try to not uh
size into the front side
megl uh if you take a look at the
overall chart the stock one from 252 um
almost
8 ish area
and
after the ipo the stock is trading
really low volume as you can see it's
only trading about 900k volume
a day so this type of volume is not
ideal and also you already perform this
consistently down trending
from the top and this type of charge
normally becomes really difficult to
short on the first screen day so
megl this one is not very ideal also
it's on ssr and borrow is relatively
cheap
i would say meg will likely to gap up
push into probably 30 40 consolidates
and dies from there
and we'll see how it goes and also we
have iron kt
this is also an ipo play
this one didn't really trade
enough volume compared to
mgl so this one will be on watch in the
upcoming days
dbpy mgl those will be momentum shift
towards the downside in about one or two
days so it will be pretty profitable in
the future
so those are all the recaps for these
videos and hopefully it's really helpful
and also make sure to
be really careful says incorrectly into
the screenplays
they do generate a large amount of
reward but also they do include a large
amount of risk so that'll be end of this
video thank you very much for watching
i'll see you guys in the next one

hello guys steven ducks here so uh today
we're going to go over
uh tons of tickers that happened in the
last two weeks and
definitely the market is back so i want
to give you guys some tips of how to
really adapt into the current market and
what's the
uh current edge that you can find uh to
trade i would say profitably uh into
this um i was a really low volume market
compared to 2021. so uh without further
ado let's uh get into the video
first of all i want to go over is hkd
this one was trading really low volume
it was ipo play
typically that one ipo play
when they had a massive round let's say
they go up 200 percent 300 in one day
trading uh tons of volume
and uh following by the first red day
from there stock should be dead
after that first red day but in this
case because it's trading really low
volume and there is
a really tight flow the flow is
definitely not 185 million i would say
it's anywhere between 1 million or even
lower
so a lot of people we're getting
squeezed on this one one is from 20 to
70 and one is from 70 to almost 167.
right now we're still not treating the
volume yet so there's no consolidation
no
resistance
we will have to see
uh how we
really play out
tomorrow if we see any type of
consolidation
but from my thoughts uh
just
looking at the data back in 2021 we need
to trade anywhere between 5 million to
10 million shares um into this price
level
uh 5 million should be enough um
and if it would gap up tomorrow and we
consolidate anywhere between 200 trade
anywhere between three to five million
shares i think that could be
a signal to short um as i said hkd this
is a really low flow and really tough to
short i would not recommend
shorting at the front side always wait
until you trade sufficient volume after
it performs first thread day or massive
consolidation so those are my thoughts
on
hkd now let's go over govx this is a
monkey pox play it's also spiking up
with siga
both of them are
doing vaccines for the monkey pucks
and you can see sigma is going parabolic
right now you know same as govx the
reason why gvx is not going as hard as
siga because it ran before the offering
around 2.5 so it's hitting that hard
wall resistance but you can see it's
slowly grinding through the resistance
this could turning out to be a massive
multi-day breakout in the future so
currently i would much prefer long and
short and as i said in the previous
video
that uh
under three dollar tickers are really
tough to short and you can see
uh after a massive consolidation around
2.4
july 26 and
we test the resistance pretty much three
four times and we came back within one
day so make sure that in the future when
the stock is consolidating forming a
multi-day resistance
always pay attention to the stock price
because if it's really low that means
the retail people can buy tons of shares
let's compare it with the flow let's say
the stock is 10 dollar
and the flow is 3 million
and geovx
stock is 2 but the flow is
12 million so for a retail person if you
have say 100k you can only buy
1 000 shares of a stock is one dollar
but you can buy
fifty thousand shares on glbx so that
makes the flow looks
really slow because retails can afford
more shares
so in this way uh govx is considered to
be i would say a microflow
if it's trading 80 million volume a day
and i would prefer going along after
probably break through the three dollar
area but always be careful in this type
of penny stocks
always do offering
either is intraday or after hour so i
would be
sizing small in this place so
going into sij this is the main play for
monkey pox we had a breakout around 14
now we're at 21 no resistance
in the history and we probably will see
this one go massive parabolic in the
future uh probably next week
uh going into
most of the breakout play flips
300 times from the
resistance level so this resistance is
around 14 right now acts as a support
14 times three this one will likely to
go up in the 30 to 40s
and i would wait
until there's a consolidation shorting
team so
those are all the main plays that's
currently happening right now we had pgy
and this is also an ipo with really low
flow it's now 605 million float
so when you trade ipos always check the
float first before you show it into it
because all those datas are not very
accurate
including feminists and yahoo finance
and those
are the factors you have to really be
pay attention to because if the flow is
different uh that means the stock is
going to play out completely different
as well
so those are my uh thoughts on all those
tickers um
definitely the market is back so i will
be looking for um
increasing my size depends on how much
volume you really get since all the
tickers are pretty much going parabolic
right now
as i said this is the first time we are
seeing the market starting to come back
since i was mdo so that's from january
uh be careful on your size and
other than that
make sure sizing small and trade
carefully so make sure hit that like

welcome to this video so today I'm going
to do a recap about the recent Runners
uh especially on some of the tickers
that doesn't really fit the criteria I
do see a lot of people portraying so I
do want to cover some of the tickers
especially on the lower floats so you
guys don't over trade in the future but
uh other than that let's get into the
video alright so the first one I want to
talk about will be shph this one was IPO
the current IPO plays they are really
difficult to short into especially when
they're just announced IPOs uh I think
we had one HKD was running on a 300K
volume and that one squeezed to 2600 so
on Lower volumes if they trade less than
1 million or less than three million
shares in one day then it's pretty much
not treatable and the spread is too big
sometimes even 10
um so uh as long as the volume exceeds
over 3 million it's okay to trade but it
has to be extremely overextended on the
first Green Day never touch IP on the
first screen day that's not really ideal
it doesn't really matter the consistent
increasing the flow after the first day
announces IPO I would prefer that it
traps large amount of volume up two day
or more than two days a run then using
the consolidations times the price and
as your resistance to shorting team so
that's my ideal thought about shorting
those IPOs but then we had a massive
drop on Friday we don't have any type of
resistance around in the 40s it
Consolidated up in the 40s for a while
and you dropped with a really low volume
um this is not I would say a
consolidation breakdown because the
ticket itself already fitted 75 percent
and they bounced off that low typically
on a regular chart this double charge
can stay up there forever they don't
have to drop
above for IPOs some they do keep drop
and drop more than 100 from where they
started so then we had one of the
bounces on Friday we found 14 to 24. uh
extensions about 60 percent I would say
yeah 70 ish uh we only have resistance
up in the balances area so it's 22-24
and on this day only traded 4 medium
volume so using bounce short shorting
SHP Edge is quite dangerous especially
on the uptrend and the stock is
unperiodic and these type of Trades the
market is training those people to show
early and they will either give you
another HKD or give you another bbvy to
squeeze everybody out then the mounting
gets rotated again so this is one of the
seasonal trades that uh the stock pretty
much the market gives you are really low
Runners lower flow and they only spec
about 40 50 then they drops and you sure
it got lucky
and in the future then in the market
comes back and catches all the people
not shorts early and stock goes up a
thousand percent and then they basically
lost money on those massive parabolic
and uh the money gets full back into the
people that sure with patients so be
extremely careful with the current
market conditions since we're in a bear
Market uh the data is not quite stable
so for this specific data I want to make
another video about it especially on to
adapt the current market conditions then
we had HKD that balanced up on Thursday
uh the stock traded about 600k volume on
this they only traded about 700k volume
well first it was like one something
meaning 1.6 million then 1.4 million uh
extension is about a thousand percent
all right this is probably shortable I
didn't really quite catch the downside
and the volume is really low so special
around here only traded about 600k
volume after the massive round and this
is a small bounce
um
pretty much it fitted all the way down
to a very spiked from the 40 breakout
level uh I was waiting on the bounces
testing the consolidations on HKD around
280 to 60ish didn't really touch it
because the overall volume is way too
low just to sizing relatively amount and
typically the stickers doesn't drop all
the way down almost 100 from the top
so uh all the recent Runners they fade
more than 75 percent I think
it's quite normal compared to in the
last couple years
typically they only do 75 then they
slowly bounce back up and slowly fade
back down again
uh this one fitted more than five
percent and you pushed less than uh 20
percent
so and the volume was 60 K oh too many
candle that is pretty much untreatable
in terms of volume so I'll say next time
when you see these type of takers try to
stay away far as possible and spread and
um the volume it's really difficult to
manage your risk and I would suggest
sizing small and when HKD came up it
also brought up am TV this is the
sympathy play of HKD this one wasn't up
that much because flow was quite big and
it's not generating enough volume so not
many people are chasing MTD it's under
three dollar stock so this is also
difficult to short you can't really say
something too much because you increase
the risk while setting into a stock
that's really cheap there's no
consolidations there is a massive
support around two so if you shorted
around 230
uh in theory you should cover some
around two then it's as I said in the
normal market conditions like 2021 it's
not going to break through the support
but I actually did these type of tickers
are not following the statistics and for
me personally for me I have to track
more data to actually get the hand of
all those low volume and low price
ticker stocks
but Rue is still root stay away from the
microflows especially and stay away from
the lower volume if the current volume
trades less than 1 million or the
estimated volume is less than one
million do not touch it it's
pretty much uh impossible to control
your risk so that'll be the end of this

going forward uh let's say a ticker is
following closely to a trillion dollar
market cap then I recommend the saying
really small and you can see this ticker
reached its do block when Consolidated
around 20 but still didn't drop on the
third day so it dropped on the fourth
day with really light volume it still
hovered around 18 for a very long time
before uh it dropped overall btct made a
mistake over here covered into I believe
once it broke 14 that's where I covered
but that is the the biggest profit and
the biggest trades through November

so you can avoid losses basically by
sizing in smaller now for bigger
accounts when you have anywhere between
1 million to 2 million you want to s in
uh 800,000 900,000 in one terer that's
where it gets a little bit tricky
because when you have a huge account and
in this small cap industries that they
can only accept uh 300K maybe 400k in
one tier because there's only limit
amount of flow only limit amount of

the rule that I mentioned two years ago
that you don't want to exceed over 10%
the entire flow size it's been changing
a little bit because you can kind of see
that the borrowing industry has been
changing in the last 3 years the borrows
become cheaper and overnight it rates
still remain the same when borrow
becomes so cheap let's say a 750k flow
only have maybe 2 cents or 4 cents it
cost you like $ few hundred to borrow
throughout the entire day and very
expensive holding overnight you can kind
of go into the short setts mentality so
they only want to trade on intraday and
they do not want to hold overnight and
the covering majority of the strength
comes in the afternoon because they
cover their shares they do not want
overnight and going to the next day with
a huge gap down because there's no
shorts in there anymore

Were there any mistakes early on in your
career that you made over and over
again?
&gt;&gt; Oh yes, there is always overt trading. I
do that every single month, every single
week. So a lot of people I spoke to have
experience talking to students that
every week or even every month go to
your account look at your losses. What
going back into losses? What did you do?
Is it over trade? Then next time make
sure to avoid that. And a lot of people
are not willing to go back to their
counseling to look at their losses
because they think it's a shame to look

[Music]
welcome to this video so today's video
is going to be a little bit different I
want to talk about how I already made
over eight figures in 2021 and how am I
adapting to the current market
conditions in 2022 so uh it's been about
uh three to four years last time I
released the course so not everything is
really updated like the dollar block
minimum shooting percentages for Gap up
shore and for other various patterns so
for this course the purpose is to adapt
to the current market conditions and all
the updated informations and also some
of the new patterns that I found out in
2021 so it's going to be a really
interesting course and now I'm doing a
pre-sale up into February so it's going
to take about four months for you guys
to see the full release version we're
currently doing a discount for about one
or two months so make sure you grab the
opportunity opportunities I'm really
excited to reduce this course hopefully
you guys can get some of my insights
about different patterns and how I
really value brand new volume and also
the different version of risk management
so those are the updates and let's get
into some of the method that I found out
in 2021 so in terms of risk management
since the FED is reducing mass amount of
printed money so there's tons of
equalities being floated into the market
I found out that there's an imitations
of how much you can size in based on the
volume and also based on the float so
there will be different version for
example you can now exceed over one
percent of the flow and you also cannot
exceed one percent of the volume so
which one comes lower you have to follow
that as a standard so let's say ABCD
that traded over 100 million shares that
you cannot exceed over one million
shares not by either shorting it or
going along but not you can really buy 1
million shares but I'm just giving an
example so if the stock is only trading
1 million shares then you cannot
assassin over 10K shares because you
also have to look at the entire day
Value Estimate as well as a full version
first of all you want to look at how
much volume I traded in the pre-market
and basically you are using pre-market
times four to ten based on the different
volume Trend then once you have the
estimated volume then you want to go
ahead and calculate how much volume it's
going to trade throughout the day then
use that volume times one percent so
that's the number you do not want to
exceed by either shorting or going along
same thing with the float now you do not
want to exceed one percent of the flow
maximum is 10 every time when I shorted
it or going along that is over 10 since
it's either doing weird stuff or ends up
going to the opposite direction most of
the time so those are the limitations of
how much volume you can set as into a
taker for example there's many
variations of that as well another one
is when I was Finding different edges of
the market you have to wait for the
uptrend to be over a lot of people are
asking about Stephen how do you know the
uptrend is over how can I avoid the
front side before I take a huge loss
whenever we are following the current
market conditions there is typically
volume Trend so whenever you are looking
at a motiv owner or a gap up short a
multi-deterometer for example that you
will need more dollar being traded into
the next day to be able to support the
breakout or the first Green Day that's
the previous day of the current Green
Day it needs to trade more dollar so you
can use either pre-market prediction or
consolidation price to calculate how
much dollar is going to trade on the
current day compared to the previous day
so you will know if the stock is likely
to continue or not and also you can
value the support level if the current
day consolidation is too close to the
previous support level then it's pretty
much not really tradable or shortable
based on multi-day Runner pattern so
once you track about enough statistics
you will find out that there is an
imitation of how much dollar can be
traded in a certain different marketing
apps this is one of the data I'm going
to release in the new courses you can
use that data and also I'm going to
teach the method of how you can really
track based on the current market
conditions it's going to be a really
useful tool I think it's going to be in
the market for many many years to come
and I don't think it will ever change it
changes slowly based on the current
market conditions but for now it's
slowly trending down and Traders needs
to be aware of that as well so those are
part of the content I want to cover for
this new course and make sure to check
out the link below there's going to be
our pre-sale only for the first month
and it's going to be fully release in
the next three months so uh hopefully
you guys are excited uh please leave a
comment below and thank you very much
for watching I will see you guys in the
next one
[Music]
thank you

what's going on everyone welcome to the
first ever cat tree podcast
[Music]
hello guys stephen here um
we're switching into
new type of content i'm being getting a
little bit tired about
doing what's the five biggest mistakes
for beginners what is the five biggest
chart that beginner has to pay attention
to so right here we have our guest
matt which is my
longtime friend so we're going to talk
about trading we're going to talk about
our life
and how has the market has been involved
recently
so
uh other than that enjoy the podcast um
yes like steve said we have been friends
for
five years now yeah 20 yeah 2016.
and
i i first got to know steve
from uh tim sykes's conference
at that time i think ducks had just
gotten close to making like a million
dollars and
i don't know we kind of just hit it off
as friends from there
there's nothing really more to that
yeah
um
you know we have kind of the same
similar interests too like he's a big
he's really into video games such as
like starcraft he used to be semi
professionals
that's like a little unknown fact about
ducks honestly
he's used to be a semi-professional
starcraft player he's really good
um and
yeah we kind of bonded through video
games and trading and we've been friends
ever since
and one of the things i found
interesting is
i never really understood what ducks
would do in trading and like how he
thought about things until i actually
played him in starcraft
so if you're a good starcraft player out
there
you'll probably be good at trading
that's that's pretty much all i could
say one of the other opinion i want to
give is that trading is you know one of
the factors based on statistics one of
the factors based on real-time counter
strategy
because every single ticker that you
trade it's
everything's different flow market cap
and based on real conditions on the
volume
every single situation is different
and you have to use the statistics as a
reference you know to kind of give you
idea which direction is going to go then
the next one will be
the real-time counter strategy that's
where like
you observe the general bigger picture
and you come up
with
strategies in real time while the stock
is developing i think that's the
i was one of the most difficult tricks
to become
like a tier higher
um
for you know the six seven figure trader
yeah a lot of people asking about like
do i already use level two do i really
use tape
i would say five percent of the time
because to be honest i don't really use
tape that much but i do like it to have
it on my scanner
overall it doesn't really help that much
i would say reading the tape
the difference between like counter
stretching and reading the tape is more
about
you have to recognize
um the tipping i would say the balance
point between the lung pressure and the
selling pressure
when the stock is about to tip over
shifting from
opportunity momentum to down trending
momentum
that's where you know the knowledge is
where your experience will be the more
experience you have the more the closer
you will get to that you know tipping
point to be able to top take a stock
uh as i said it's also based on
statistics and you know the way you
recognize and be able to find a specific
counter also
whenever you get into
six figure seven figure and potentially
eight nine figures especially when
getting to eight to nine figure
area the size is a huge problem because
if you think about there's only a
specific amount of money to be made
right
let's say the stock has three hundred
thousand dollars to be made you shorted
at the top
and you hit the max size then you can
make three hundred thousand dollars on
the thirty percent
right but if you size in more the stock
will drop half 15 percent to make your
300 000
the more you size in the less range the
stock will create
so
whenever you're setting to the super
maximum the stock is not going to drop
it drops one percent
instant reverse
so for the buyers
uh that's in the stock
and that when the whenever seeing the
stock drops 30 40 50
they get a little frustrated because
they don't think the stock is dead and
majority of time it is
that's basically people's mindset but
when you see the stock it's only
dropping 10 feet 5 percent and you're
setting too much to get at 300 000 dying
ball is a huge risk
so
and you have to pay attention to
how much money you want to set in
and how much range is likely to create
if you break that range and the range
will actually shrink you'll shrink to
the point that buyers do not feel the
dangers anymore then that's where it
just
comes back in take your huge size and
you take a huge loss right and so i
think like with all of that it's
more than just oh i see
a gap up short and i go short on the
opening bar yeah so
the level of detail
what you're talking about is essentially
the counter strategy or the strategy
that's employed on top of
the pattern recognition part yeah and
that's i think that's the hard part i'm
still trying to figure it out
as i told you that i don't think i hit
the cap yet but i can see it and uh
i'm practicing to be there but
yeah i'm not there yet
right
yeah there's a certain amount of layers
to it like if you only only want to make
five figures
patterns is very sufficient six figures
maybe you need some mark experience
seven no
eight that's that's impossible
so it's
it's
up to you know the traders if you want
to be successful you want to keep going
because most people come into this
industry they are in it for money
and i'm in it for
i would say
um passion and
my execution in terms of my plan even
though
i will tell my you know jimmy or matt
or people around me if i made a trade
even though i made like a couple million
dollars on the trade i'm still talking
to them like i up i don't think i
executed my trade i'm not in it for the
money and the money is on the side but
i'm in it for
my executions my plan
and if the stock didn't go the direction
that i expected to
um
i get a little bit mad so
yeah you're more about
you're in it because you like the game
money is just the byproduct of being
good at the game like you're
it's like playing chess or anything you
know people play that their entire lives
because
it's not about winning necessarily it's
about
you you enjoy the game
much more than
just the money aspect because of people
if people if you just focus on the money
like don't get me wrong people get into
trading for money there's nothing we're
not saying that's wrong yeah what we're
saying though is like the people that
are in
trading for
the rest of their life it's usually
because they're addicted to the game how
to improve themselves and it's like the
same thing with starcraft going back to
that which is
you know
you are constantly having to adapt as
the game evolves like
you'll never be the best starcraft
player the best starcraft players in the
world when they go head to head the
margin of who wins is razor thin and in
trading
you know if someone makes
10 20 30 40 50 60 80 million a billion
dollars
they you see that they continue to trade
because they're like well how can i
uh do
this much better next year and so
they're all about
optimizing the game
and
even though they know that they can
never outright be the best and
i think in life those are the best kinds
of games ones where you can't just like
outright win
you know you can't be the
you're going to be the best forever and
ever and you have to constantly
adapt your strategy and adapt what
you're doing
and you'll play it until the day that
you die
also one of the other factor is if you
are in it for passion as i said money is
one of
this good is on the side
but
if you really want to be in this game
you want to survive because
for other
[Music]
industry it's a little bit easier like
for exam if you fail the exam you can
you can potentially take it again but if
you fail on the trade you feel three
times your account is gone
so
for that specific reason
especially for beginners you have to be
really careful like i can screw up
several times i'll be fine i can come
back but for beginners is they screw
five times they're gone so
that's
and you have to
be very careful take
every step very carefully um
then you kind of wanna get to a point
that you
don't really care about the money
anymore you want to be in the safe net
that's why whenever i trade
i have a 1 million dollar in my account
i will have 92 million dollars as my
backup backup account in case
one day
i up
so
um once you have that
uh money i would say
um
i don't know like a safety net like you
don't you still have chances if you
up once you do once you like
don't have that thought like oh tomorrow
i might fall on the pdt right like i
need to make my money back today if i
don't make money i'll get a 90 day ban
um
so you always have money to replenish
and in this way it's much better to
trade because we have a much freer
mindset like a free mindset to like
not worry about
you don't have enough food tomorrow like
stuff like that
so yeah you're not trading with money
that you don't necessarily need
yeah and yeah that definitely
overall i think improves a lot of
people's psychology and making them not
blow up as much
but there are people who definitely i've
seen them
they have to be
pressured in order for them to perform
no none of that
i have my own opinion because whenever
you trade with the money that you don't
really need
uh
yes that's a that's that's the correct
statement but how much money you should
trade in i think that's where you land
between the money makes you pressured
and the money doesn't make you pressure
it's in that middle line like it's in
the circle
it's in the middle line of it goes one
dollar above you're nervous because one
dollar below you're not nervous in that
middle of nine that's where you perform
the best
um
that's just my personal experience about
all right sizing
yeah but some but i'm just saying like
for me
like i like to be very like hands off
and just
let it do its thing and
i don't trade to a size where
i'll be in the streets tomorrow
and i don't trade under to where i'm
like what's the point of trading
yeah
um so yeah i try to stay in the middle
too and i think that brings up like what
we always talk about we talked about it
here you talked about last time
something we talked about
over the last five years which is
trying to be in the center of kind of
that yin versus yang where you're kind
of in the middle ground all the time no
matter what it what you're doing mindset
wise accounts account what account set
wise
because i think often times people
push too much to one side it's
definitely a balancing act and i think
ultimately
that's probably what makes trading the
most difficult part for people because
people either want to feel
people always want to feel like they
have total control over the situation
and in trading it's kind of like you do
all the work and then you kind of
execute that and whatever happens
happens yeah that's when you have to
have like the worst case scenario
situation that you know
you know when you know stuff hits the
fan
to know like
how to deal with it yeah exactly
yeah
i always have that mindset like if i go
in today and this is the max i will lose
we've been triggered two times and then
the next day
doesn't i don't they don't have to be
married in a specific day which i did a
couple times before almost wiped me out
yeah i think one of the things that you
possess
for someone who trades
completely discretionarily
that a lot of people don't have is the
ability to just kind of
take your wins take your losses
and then the next day come back and be
and just do what you need to do
um you're very much when you trade
you're very much like in the present you
don't really focus on like
what happened yesterday um and i think
that's like a huge skill set that a lot
of people don't have when they trade
yeah one other thing is like the traders
normally get like affected by outer um
like the other the environment of
twitter i like twitter design on twitter
i'm telling you right here of all you
guys
if you guys are interested in trading or
you guys are beginner in trading don't
look at twitter
trading is not legal legends
[Laughter]
like you're going as a team right and
you don't know who up somebody
up and you have somebody to blame
matt did it jimmy did it like
you you always find somebody to blame
but trading is more like a starcraft you
versus the market
and you versus the other trader
and it's always about self-improvement
always about
how to
find the best strategy for the market
and for yourself
because if you know yourself really well
you know how to counter yourself
like to get rid of the bad habits you
know your weaknesses you know when you
can use applicants to ask your strength
you know to counter you don't wake up a
certain amount of time
and
uh
for example i used to trade in
pre-market that was years ago
and
one day i found out oh trading the
primark is bad
[Laughter]
and
i was like okay all right well i will
play starcraft until 11 so i wake up
late i forced myself to wake up by 9 29
at one point 9 29 so i wake up give me
like 30 seconds to watch my face i'm
sitting around the computer and start
trading so like
that's one of the method you can use if
you're trading pre-market and you always
up in pre-market
then you can use the same concept for
everything yeah
i agree
i mean if you're going through a rut or
you're
taking multiple losses it's definitely
good to
just try to distract yourself for us
it's playing video games for other
people
they may do something else to go take a
walk go whatever
but yeah i think it's important to do
that
a lot of people get mad about it because
like
get mad about
even though
you
got to a point that you're you know
pretty
aware of what's happening in the market
and you
have a plan and you executed your plan
and you still lost that's where it
triggers the most traders the most
and it even triggers me now today but if
you think about it
what it happened it's in the past but
this is
the mistakes that
uh as i call your losses the result for
today is not repetitive in the future
because
this is only like one out of 99
you know right this is one trade out
like a thousand trades yeah in your life
yeah yeah but
the problem is is that people have grown
up in a certain
ideology
where
they believe
yes uh
i have control over everything in my
life
and when something messes up it's my
fault
yeah and it's the same you see this to
give you an example it's the same thing
when people go to college they think by
studying something
they will have a job that's not true
when you go to college you're trying to
put all the odds in your favor so just
like in trading when you're doing the
work and you're studying you're just
trying to put all the odds in your favor
to have a successful outcome that
doesn't guarantee an outcome and so
people get hung up on the expectation
of i put in all this time i did all this
effort
and i still lost and that infuriates me
because i i feel out of control and so
they just get stuck in that loop
and ultimately yeah it's always like
trading is difficult because you have to
be like in the present and the future at
the same time because
like whenever you took a loss like you
it's not that's not repetitive and you
know you will wait in the future you
kind of have to see okay by the end of
the year you know i will still make
money
and a lot of people are so stuck in the
present and get so mad about it
uh then just endless
loop of that uh because and what if you
think about if you compare two traders
right one trader that has really good
discipline one twitter is more like
uh a gunslinger
one makes huge games and one makes
consistent gains
there's a difference between both of
them but if you think about
in terms of performance one take a huge
loss one take a small win there is a
drastic difference between you know this
guy is actually up 50 000 from you know
the guy
who just took a loss so if you repeat
that 10 times you can see okay well
they're not a different level anymore
so um discipline and details really
matters because
if a two trader goes into a market and
even though with the smallest thing
they you know
one has a little bit better discipline
that will create a huge gap
in five years and once you realize i say
oh
i'm already you know
99 levels down from that person
one of the other thing i want to talk
about is uh
the the traders that actually have um
followings
and
i'm not gonna name but like there's tons
of traders have you know ten thousand
twenty thousand followers out there
maybe even
more than me but the problem is
those traders trying to
[Music]
because they're
so
have such a following and people always
think they're right
they were they will pretend
they're right if even though they're
wrong
like you have that um
the pressure of being right because a
lot of people think you are right
so you don't
recognize your mistakes
because you're in in that such of like
oh
steve's the best maddie matt is the best
i've never been wrong i might be like oh
yeah i'm never wrong i would never be
wrong before
and we are all human it doesn't really
matter you have a million or like you
know seven billion following me you are
going to make mistakes and you have to
admit to that you made a mistake and
have to admit that
you have to make changes to it if you
keep going that route i always think
you're right and finding excuses for
yourself you're just going to like
fall
yeah yeah and um just as a side note
like all of these people that have
massive followings understand guys like
followings can be faked
yeah you know
and
a lot of times people can make thousands
of different accounts under multiple
different users
and
you know you can see like oh this person
has a million followers well 30 of those
could be just fake accounts
and you know you really shouldn't listen
to
people who have large followings have
you find them on a youtube ad
you know always do your due diligence
when it comes to that and yes the people
that have massive followings yeah they
feel like
they are oh well i'm never wrong i
always make money and ultimately that
affects their own trading
because they end up blowing up their
accounts or losing millions of dollars
because they're like oh well i took a
trade
and now i need to get out of that trade
because i'm wrong but i can't get out
because people think that i'm right
it's a vicious cycle because
like steve said before
training is an individual
sport very much like starcraft you have
your individual like ranks it's one
verse one
you know training communities exist to
help
but make sure you understand the
difference between
you know seeking help for your problem
and just blindly following someone
without
you know critically assessing
you know
are they doing the right things any
trader that's real always loses money um
yeah
there's there's no doubt about it i've
never met anyone where it's like hey
i've never lost before but people on
twitter and youtube they pretend as if
99.9
[Laughter]
um
and understand like you know i've said
this in other podcasts too
you know no matter the trader you're
only as good as your last trade and i
don't think a lot of people ever take
that to heart
just because i won
yesterday that has no bearing on the
next trade i take and so
and that's why you there's not a there
there's no individual that exists in
trading that is the god of trading
because yeah uh it just
you're only as good as the last trade
that you made
and um so just be careful out there and
understand that if you if you think
people aren't above making fake accounts
to bolster
their egos and sell their subscription
services like you are naive yeah also
one thing um
me and matt both have our
own educational service
uh with all of you guys out there uh
one thing is
whenever you're looking at somebody's
youtube and how they really talk well
that's first one you can you can
basically judge that does their pattern
actually fit some type of logic right
that's number one thing you have to
verify number two is
you want to go in and actually verify by
yourself to see okay this
this guy
said this this this um
you can test it out by yourself you can
build your own spreadsheets and your own
way to test it out okay this is actually
legit a lot of people just blindly
following
other people be like oh yeah i have you
know i trained a 50 000 million their
students that doesn't mean their pattern
is working
it just
means they probably had
um
something
you know it's
it doesn't mean their uh pattern is uh
you know successful so let me give you
this one statistics i was on a phone
call with one of the brokerage owners
they have about 20 something thousand 25
000 clients
and
there is about 10 percent of people
that doesn't lose money
so that's up now they make money no they
don't make money
but they don't lose money oh okay so
they break even their break even that's
2500 out of 25 000.
now
in that 10
you have five percent that makes money
including one dollar
okay so that's one thousand two hundred
now you have that now ten percent of
that
uh 1200
makes about a six figure
a year
so
that cuts down to 100 people
then 10 percent of that
no 5 of that 100 people makes over 5
million dollars
a year now
out of those five people three people
keeps rotating back and forth because
one year they take loss on the money so
there's only two person that can be
consistently staying
at the top only two
so
there's not many people you can count
them either that's one broker just
pretty big it's pretty big brokerage
house if you count all the brokerage
house out there you know
including robin hood weeble i don't even
know if people make money on robin hood
because top traders don't use weapons
no no
for all of you
young people out there no
self-respecting trader uses robin hood
for like a billion reasons yeah um
you know that's just basically a cash
grab
um but yeah i mean the percentage of
successful people who are successful in
trading is is very minor and the people
that are at the very top who make a lot
of money consistently is even smaller
yeah um it's a very hard field
it falls into the general statistics of
like running a business like 90 of
businesses fail you never hear that
about them yeah and only 10 of them
survive and not just to date myself of
how old i am
when i when i was growing up there were
there were like a lot of search engines
besides google there
just tons of different
types of businesses that all did the
same thing
how many search engines are left
one or two
so again
you know not many businesses survive
past five years 10 years 15 years 20
years and so if you're getting into
trading have the expectation that you
are probably going to fail no matter who
you listen to
but if you enjoy the game keep playing
because you just may
actually
make it out alive
that's all
it's all about self improvement so
exactly every person is different you
have your own personalities and your own
habits you have your own schedule
so it's up to you to make it work
recognize your strengths recognize your
weaknesses and you know use your
weaknesses as your strength
then
after that
uh combining
like you can treat stock markets a
virtual world combining the real world
and the virtual world to make them work
together it's
it's pretty difficult
i would say and
i've said this before like i honestly
think that
you know most people are not
i don't want to sound like a downer or
that i'm
i'm sad but i i'm just trying to be
blunt like
you know most people
should not be trading most people should
never get into the business
you know if all you have is ideas of
grandeur that's not enough to sustain
what is required of you to be successful
um and that goes back to what we were
talking about before which is like if
you just focus on the money
you probably won't make it like you
actually have to
enjoy
the game yeah
because it's
it's a game that i think is very
difficult and
um
you know
yeah we both run education services and
all honesty if you come to me and you're
like i want to join your education
service i will tell you don't bother
and the reason is this
you know there's a lot of free stuff out
there that's number one
number two
uh
i just find that most people aren't
serious like you can talk to any of my
students i literally have a student of
mine that joined my service and i told
him not to do it like i was like just
don't do it like learn on your own and
see how willing you are actually will
you wake up every single day without
paying a single dollar and actually
learn will you read all of these books
will you do all of these things
and that's my litmus test because
honestly like
you know i think
just most people aren't cut out for it
and i will never
lie to you and say
my training service is the best and
you'll be a multi-millionaire like no
it's not going to happen um even though
a lot of people sell that type of dream
like it's just not gonna happen yeah
well first of all it's like a lot of
people don't even take it seriously uh
that just filtered out ninety percent
now right right off the bat
yeah and then after that
it's very i would say
trading yourself is a very anti-human
[Laughter]
like very very anti-human like
you just wanted the market itself wants
to trigger you
uh and also
i've been training for almost a very
long time now and people are asking
steven you know
as far as my knowledge you are one of
the best
uh what do you think about the stock
market right now i still i still say
it's freaking difficult
yeah
if you're
listening to this like you need
write down like all the things that
you're learning for free
and if it's like yeah i spend an hour on
youtube
like that's not enough like you're not
serious
you know i've had people come and
they're like i can't find success for 10
years my question is is what are you
doing yeah
and a lot of it is just going from
different educator to different educator
you know
reading this book to that book and it's
like you should have a structure to all
of your trades you should know your edge
and if you don't know that and you're
not willing to put in the time to that
then don't even bother trading
and because you guys i think all listen
to a bunch of people who don't trade
they have no idea what they're talking
about and all of their education stuff
can be found online for free
you know if you want to learn patterns
you don't need to pay for that
there's tons of patterns out there
you want to learn how to program
there's legitimately free content now to
learn how to program when i was growing
up there was not that content by the way
fyi
[Music]
you know so the question always is how
serious are you
and uh
don't sell yourself on a bag of dreams
because most of you won't make it yeah
when you are look when you're seeking
information
it's a it's a midpoint between
you know have someone to look up to but
at the same time understand that it's an
individual sport
and that you probably won't make it but
if you love doing it then do it yeah
yeah a lot of people used to make fun of
me like hey steve how did you make me
know 900 000 in the first year and a lot
of people making me make fun of me me
you know studying on the toilet i mean
you gotta you gonna do what what you
gotta do here so
you know i
i mean you can make make fun of me on
starting on the toilet but you can't
make fun of me making six million
dollars you want to try this
yeah the study part is is crucial um
because i mean i don't know about you
but i have people that literally
buy my stuff and then they don't like
look at it like they don't even
they don't even yeah there's people yeah
there's people yeah buys myself stuff
and like it's like what they watch for
two minutes all right i'm out
i'm like
it doesn't happen through osmosis
you know yeah
and then there's people who
like study hard
but they still don't make it and
um
i don't know
why they would ever think like oh if i
buy a course you know i'll learn
i can make money like again no matter
who you go with no matter what you learn
your expectation should be
yeah i learned something but that
doesn't necessarily equate to
me being successful in the market
yeah one thing is like you kind of have
to have your own expectations of like
what's
if you
want to trade and you love trading
um
then you want to
make
trading as your passive income where
we want to be a full-time trader like
you more want to focus on okay i want to
be a part-time trader this is no this is
not the game that i like but i'm trying
to make make it for the money
it's oh it's
i think it's okay to get up to
six figure a year max
then if you don't really love the game
you ain't going over that so that's just
my personal opinion for
like how you want to do it yeah yeah i
don't know i try not to put
figures
on people i mean
because i'm always either disappointed
or surprised
yeah it's hard to quantify
what someone can possibly make from the
market because it's like
uh every strategy has a weakness so this
is like another thing
yeah
strategies
like
they die or they go sideways and they
may come back and the strategy you used
a couple years ago may not be the
strategy you use today and like i think
people have a hard time understanding
that
i've been adjusting my pattern
every single year when the pandemic
happened my pattern wasn't working for
like a good three months until i
actually you know put all the changes
updated pattern then
i started to make money from there so
yeah i just think like that's like a
misnomer like people get in their head
that i just learned this one thing and
then i'm done for the rest of my life
[Music]
so if you you know find that our
conversation that's useful you know take
some notes and we'll be
sharing more stuff in the future
and uh yeah if you like it leave a
comment below if you have a question you
can also leave a comment below
other than that
i'll see you guys

um I have looked actually looked into
those uh filing before it actually um
affect my uh I would say judgment
whenever I'm trading because I think
there's few times that there's warrants
around four and there's consolidations
at four and people think the warrant is
going off and you know selling it the
stock at for dollar and a lot of people
packed in Shing at four next day stock

SOURCE VIDEO: The 2 important Factors in Low Float Stocks (Dux's Weekly Analysis) [TXWSUf4xD1w].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's all gasoline Dexter welcome to
the new YouTube video things are little
bit different to technical stuff we're
gonna talk about one is higher
neutralized area another one will be
micro flow lathe a breakdown those two
factors there now consider as a pattern
but those two factors are extremely
important when you want to shorten to
stock or when you want to go buy into
your stock so let's get into this week's
ticker first so OPG then this one was
considered as a gap up short but it's a
microphone the flow is actually under 1
million market cap is under 4 million
so the Starkiller morning push most of
the time when stock started this morning
spike it doesn't have a chance to come
back except my port flow since he was a
micro flow i did not trade on the
sticker at all but in fact related I
will probably shorting through the
morning push and I induced panic and get
squeezed again took a loss and that's a
fake cow and short again
tickle also gue spike again don't ever
try to use the entire hands on kpop
Shore especially on the first screen day
now another one is when the stock is
consolidating so when the micro flow is
consolidating for couple hours that
means if there's a high demand very low
supply to stop supposed to go up since
it's raining so much volume if it's not
going up and stuck at the same level the
means the stock is bearish because
there's only the amount of supply since
there's so much demand the stuff still
not moving
that means the stock turns from bullish
to bearish in the afternoon if you track
statistics most of the morning spike
usually fail micro flow it's a little
bit different same thing applies to
microphone if the stock it decides to
consolidate the breakout in the
afternoon it's unlikely to break it
through you can see into the spray couch
at a bunch of people buying the breakout
and dumped all the way around $7 and
people are looking to buy into breakouts
for microphone sometimes buying into
micro flow it depends on what timing are
buying into if you buy into breakouts in
the morning of course that's a consider
of good buying you for buying the micro
flow into morning breakout if it doesn't
really go
da hai then he is considered to be a
good Rika by but if you know most of the
breakouts in afternoon do fail then do
not train to bind to this breakup
because you are likely to get trapped
there are many examples like afternoon
dump with micro flow because in first if
the stock decides to do reverse split
multiple times and you take a look at a
historical chart you can see pretty much
stockist on training again and again
again and doing a reverse fits again and
again and again
that means the stock is trying to take
investors money the stock doesn't really
spike with good intention that means
it's gonna be a very temporary spike and
you have to be really careful with this
type of micro flow I'll say people with
big positions they're manipulating micro
flow something like arkadii OPTN
they're holding or large positions by
themselves if they decides to release
those shares then you cannot be the back
holders and you might be a bad horse for
a long time because the stock really
compacts up and cannot exit your
positions so holding into these type of
stocks does not give you a good
long-term returns so people know that
that's why people do really don't hold
overnight and you can see when start
start reaching in tube at the end of the
day the stock dumps about 7080 percent
of its own game and that's why people
doesn't want to hold overnight and risk
of offering in the middle of the day
so if I'm looking for a run pattern do
not buy into the afternoon break out if
the status has stood at say consolidates
in the pre-market not very high didn't
really jump up that high so let's assume
the stock gaps about 20 percent
consolidate then break out it's likely
to work but if it gaps out but if it
gets up about like to say three hundred
percent four hundred percent it's really
I don't like to spike again because the
stock already gapped up so high there's
not much risk reward if you're trying to
buy it again if you're trading in the
market you want to find okay well what's
the maximum for these type of stocks
spike in one day for example let's say
first green day I'm Michael flow the
maximum spiking percentage will be three
hundred percent for hundred percent but
if the stock already
five percent the pre-market it's very
unlikely plus tactics back again this is
why tracking statistics should help you
improve your trading performance we have
seen many of them opt-ins eet X those
are two example charts
always keep your risk you really really
tight if you are beginner I don't really
suggest trading opt NC e TX because
there's going to be a high spread
extremely fast by campaña Q fair not
getting used to those type of exit and
entry then you will get emotional and
start to have a really bad I'm trading
to exit so this is one of the charge
that happened on Friday and tgn the
sticker is little bit different compared
to others a market cap is a relatively
high compared to what we trade regularly
macro flow is anywhere between 20
million to 100 million but this is
actually at the maximum flow is a bit
too high which if we trade anywhere
between 3 to 20 million this is 27
million so the stock is pretty much at
the maximum market cap and flow wrench
for these type of tickets you have to be
really careful because if it doesn't
really meet any patterns and the stock
does weird actions a lot of people just
look at this as gap up short if the
stock gaps up if it doesn't really gap
up that high it does not consider as a
gap up short the stock has to be over
let's say hundreds of percent compared
to the size only up 30 percent and
people are showing random spikes that's
why it causes all types of squeeze if
there's no large gap up that means
showing spike doesn't have really good
risk reward
since the market cap and the flow it's
out of the range that we typically trade
then you won't be have that much
statistics on it that's where you like
me to take a loss so I'm teaching any
SEPA ticker always wait for a key move I
think you made a key move right here you
going from 4.03 to 3.7 it did a large
panic but the start wasn't even after
much so really not try to short on tgn
that's a much risk reward so mplt
we see a lot of low volume and spiking
tickers going off lately and ability is
one of them there's
like that if the stock to trading under
1 million or treating for mini or under
that's considered not a tradable ticker
if the star did a really low volume and
tends to spike about 50% or 70% then we
call that a neutralized level the volume
so low you cannot either enter the
disparities huge secondly there's not
that many people trading you cannot wait
for a long time for a panic words that
won't even panic at all do not trade
into these type of neutralized area if
the stuff does not create enough range
for NBT you can see that there's
resistance in the 16 $14 area but you do
not see any volumes being traded in that
current day so the style has to reach me
in my mind for it to be able to place
any template raids into these type of
tickers the especially on low flow if
it's tritium really low volume and on
low flow one Kandor tunic a volume can
jump the price about one or two dollars
if you size in into this hat the taker
then there's gonna be two second you're
gonna be down a lot of money so ranch
and bottom needs to be existed at the
same time and make sure those two has to
be sufficient enough after fits those
two criterias then decide to make your
trade there's a lot of ticker going on
in August and September I see a lot of
people feeling informal and start over
trade but for these type of takers make
sure to stay away because you don't get
stuck and take a lot see venturi so
overall it's pretty boring week and
hopefully learn something you shouldn't
be trading because there's no actually
statistics on it you are trading the
market with odds you are not trading
with folk gamble so not be end of video

SOURCE VIDEO: The 3 Best Long⧸Buying Strategies in 2019 Market. (MUST WATCH FOR BEGINNERS) [A4sRqpxj1gk].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys diamond doctor welcome to
this series of YouTube videos and today
we're going to talk about the best three
long pattern strategies have been
tracking for the past month so I should
give you some tips and I haven't
finished all the data yet but you can
use this as your I was the kind of
mindset or type of frame or structure
you can use to trap specific tickers and
the reason you have a bunch of runners
the angio
xng TBI MRI they all have common stuff
that laid around I build out couple
structures for them we can get into the
video I know about it so before I get
into the video make sure you hit the
like button and also leave a comment
below what should I do for the next
video alright so for long strategies I
want you two guys to take a look on X
and T be NGO and BMI those are the three
biggest runners that happened I will say
for the past few weeks and B and Jill is
one of the best follow both BMI with a
sympathy plate and follow it xnt with
mass among traded now the first common
thing you look at is market cap so
different market cap zones perform
different percentages on the stock entry
day so especially on something like B
and Jill and BMI those two are
considered as a micro cap the spiking
percentage on on the day it can be
exceeding two hundred percent seven
percent sometimes even thousand percent
all those tickers they have one specific
thing they're all SSR so when the SSR is
on the ticker especially on the first
screen day it means two words to polish
so be NGO and be I mine
they're both SSR on the day and when it
spiked and the second thing you wanna
look at is the market cap well first
thing we already looked at float the
market cap they're both very similar one
is about nine million this won't work
out pretty much always on game but when
they spiked it to $5 I think is right
around 20 million 30 million market cap
so we can use this so right now it's $1
ish when it hits $5 so use 10 million
market cap times 5 which is 13 million
and also super close to be IMI and both
tickers maximum squeezing percentage or
maximum spiking percentage will be near
500% so this one actually went from
chewed 11 is well actually it went from
1 to 5 so there are both 500 percent and
once you know the
and you can put that in your spreadsheet
that say when the stock is on SSR was a
maximum tab with 50 million and the
maximum spiking percentage would be five
hundred percent so in this case you can
use this as like an average taking
profit percentages let's say I already
went long at one so the maximum is five
hundred percent and hourly exit most of
the positions but I know there's a
maximum pullback point so I want to exit
right before the maximum percentage
which is how many percent now something
you can put your spreadsheets to remind
you of where you take profits and also
can help you top ticket the ticket when
you are going along
now let's follow with X and T now in
this XM t is trading much different
market cap zone this is around two
hundred meeting market tab and flow I
think was around 30 to 20 million if you
want to check the acura you can check FM
basic calm or yahoo finance those are
the two most convenient website and
check for accurate flow a market cap if
you want to be more accurate and more
specific about warns and offering price
you can go ahead and check at sec gothic
own that website has the most accurate
flow and market cap in print in stock
secretary it's not that important to
read the full fundamental because pretty
much opening stock fundamental are super
garbage next thing you want to look at
the chart performances when you take a
look up this chart the chart is trading
massive amount of volumes same thing
with be NGO something was x NE t vm i
trade the over I think was 50 million
volume 25 million volume with a two
million flow so that's about 10 times of
low rotation
be NGO traded about 60 million volume I
think 10 million shares it's assuming to
miniatures
so that's about five times of floor
rotation now follow with XA et this one
trade about 61 million volume but it has
about 20 million flow so that's a three
times for rotation now in this case you
can also put your spreadsheet as say
it's saying in this case you can also
put this factoring in your spreadsheets
let's say with the flow anywhere between
to anywhere between x three to ten times
its concert to really polish is because
if the flow keeps rotating there's more
buyers to keep coming in and when
there's more demand the price is likely
to go up now the third thing we don't
look at it's the chart itself when a
stock keeps going and it doesn't really
have a long period of consolidation time
and when we studied and when I started
back in the days
parabolic moves fast moves like when
this candle spikes 50 percent 30 percent
or a hundred percent those type of fast
move something like one from one to four
super fast those involves a lot of
emotional play there will be short
sellers shooting at the parabolic move
there will be buyers buying a parabolic
move every single moves are super
emotional now you want to put buyers and
sellers into the same computations and
when the stock has a really low flow
when the buyers and sellers are really
fighting each other when the stock is
attracting more volume that means
there's more buyers going to come in
just by supply demand itself the buyers
will win is because when the stock is
attracting more volume and it's not
consolidating short sellers are
emotional that's the best scenario to
really catch saucers off-guard that's
the reason why I tell you guys never
sure on the first Green Day when there's
more emotional movie involved and
there's a lot of one being traded in the
ticker basically the more demand will
come in there's only limit amount of
supply that's why the stock can go three
four hundred percent the same thing
happened on B and Jill if you take a
look at intraday chart right around here
the stock is only doing per buttock move
when the stock is getting halted the
reason why stock is hotter is they're
jumping too fast when every time you to
fat it gets interesting and when the
stock is halted people are scared or
people are feeling emotional it's a the
size likely to pull back
turns out I didn't and trait about
families are hotter again people can't
really tell if it's a t1 212 or
volatility hole if there's more
emotional and parable move in the ticker
the stock is likely to go up same thing
with ex ante you don't really see very
specific tire range of consolidation in
those
those tickers the stock bounced back in
from three to four dollars that's a
large range of consolidation P&amp;G didn't
really consolidate at all until we're
hitting later of the day
same thing with BIA mine and
consolidated about an hour then you
start to spike again when you want to go
long you want to focus on something
that's tracking a lot of volume and the
stock is on SSR the stock is likely to
flow rotate for about three to ten times
anywhere between that point and also we
want to track something that has really
short range of consolidation and also
the time period of that consolidation is
very short that's the key component for
a short service become really nervous
and start cutting their positions so
that's the couple sectors you need to
track when you want to specifically go
along I don't have enough data to really
support a theory yet but just based on
my observations from the past year and
to first Green Day always involved with
SSR massive volume with short period
consolidation guarantee qualities they
always tend to spike by the end of the
day and typically continues in the
second day for most opinion staffs I
wouldn't really be comment and for most
of the penny stocks I wouldn't really
recommend to go overnight is because
you're basically risking entry offering
most of tickers can do offering and
destroy you from now if you take a look
at PNG oh you mean from basically for
two sub one in one day so that is the
risk and those criterias I've just
talked about it's more for intraday non
pattern only as I said not recommended
overnight so that'd be the end of the
video hopefully guys like it and I feel
like I'm really behind the view my
account statements so I would do a
September for maybe next couple videos
and we can do like a statistics 102 if
you have another suggestions about what
should I do for long or short I'll leave
a comment below and let me end up with
video thank you very much
yeah we'll see you guys next time

and depending on your strategy that
also ready
hello guys steven doctor so today's
content will be a little bit more
beginner focused
and today i will share about three tips
that i wish i know before i started
trading
so before i start this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
it's really going to help our youtube
channel to produce more free content
so uh let's get into the video the first
tip includes about two to three points
and the first point i want to talk about
will be producing your edge
now what do i mean by producing my edge
a lot of people jumping
into the free brokerage and getting the
first trade
and make sure getting their first
gratification of
the first scan giving to their account
and they're really happy
and that's where you started wrong as a
beginner
now personally i started that way as
well
i started with td ameritrade and at that
time i don't really know what risk
management was
so uh i was lucky i made about two
hundred to three hundred dollars
and that's pretty much ninety percent of
the beginners make
all the time so here is a very useful
tip
when you are trying to get into some
industries you don't know
you want to make sure to find a strategy
that have about
anywhere between 70 to 85 winning
percentage
and with a small account that most
beginners have anywhere between three
thousand to five thousand
you want to slowly growing that into
30k to 50k to make sure you're getting
over pdt
once you get over pdt then you can start
to size up and potentially getting a
second strategy to focus on
so that's my personal advice because i
found that very useful if you are only
focusing on one strategy
then you will pretty much ignore all the
noises
out there and only focus on your own
performances will be
much easier to grow your account
comparing to
when you're starting out and you're
trying to focus seven things at once
so once you produce the strategy you
want to find a brokerage that's
specifically designed for a strategy
and personally i use trade zero center
point
interactive broker e-trade and pretty
much all of the brokerage before
now if your strategy are 100 long
focused
then i would recommend interactive
brokerage because they charge much
cheaper
compared to other brokerage charge about
ten dollars
per trade now there is difference
between
tickets and how many shares you are
trading and you can choose different
plans you will have to figure that out
that specifically fits your strategy
so you can save as much as you can
especially on trading fees
early days back in 2016 the fees were
kind of crazy borrow fees are pretty
much around 20
to 30 percent if you are winning on a
trade and it will take
about 20 to 30 of your profits
so that doesn't fit very well to my
strategy nowadays they only take about
five to ten percent not some new
brokerage even
take much less so finding a brokerage
that fits your strategy
is very important so two beginner steps
finding your strategy that has 70
to 85 percent your long-term
performances now
second you want to find a specific
brokerage that suits your strategy
to make sure you're getting much less
fees compared to the brokerage out there
so the second tip i want to talk about
is risk management now this
part is really hard to get a hand off
especially as a beginner
now let me give you a decent concept for
trying to understand
for normal risk award you want to find
anywhere between one to two to one to
three now one to four
is the best reward that i can think of
one to five doesn't really exist
unless you have the perfect
opportunities this type of opportunity
only happens anywhere between three to
five times per year
so in general trades will happen
anywhere between one to one
one to two to one to three one to one
very risky one to two
that's the trade i will generally take
in normal trading days
one to three is those type of
opportunity doesn't really happen that
often
it happens about anywhere 20 to 30 times
per year
so i want to give how to really manage
this type of
one to one one to two 103 reward so for
example what do i mean by a one to two
one to one or one two
three now for one to one you are risking
a hundred dollars to make
a hundred dollars one to two you're
risking one hundred dollar to make two
hundred dollars
one two three same thing risking one
hundred dollar to make three hundred
dollars
now what type of situations you should
take if the risk award is one to one
so this goes into the strategy just
built
if you have a strategy that gives you
about anywhere between 70
to 85 winning percentage and you should
try to find out
okay in this specific strategy in what
type of condition
that the pattern winning percentage will
have 85
now even what type of condition the
winning percentage will have 70 percent
so you can use that type of winning
percentage to increase your position
size
for example so if i'm risking 100 to
make 100
the reward and risk is pretty much
identical now i better make sure this
pattern
is going to win 85 percent of the time
if the pattern that meets the condition
that this pattern will win 85
at this time then i will definitely take
that one to one trade
now if the winning percentage is really
low anywhere between 70
to 75 percent then i will skip that
trade
as a beginner you want to focus the
pattern that has the highest winning
percentage now for anywhere that's lower
you don't want to take it because you
don't want to risk
and start getting emotional once your
account size gets over two hundred
thousand to three hundred thousand then
you can focus the pattern
that has anywhere between seventy
percent to seventy five percent
so let's give a total conclusions first
of all do not try to rush in
and try to use robin hood or any type of
free brokerage out there
try to find the correct strategy first
you want to focus on
high winning percentage and happens very
often anywhere between
70 times to 80 times per year then you
want to find the brokers that best
minimize your trading fees
for the last you want to focus on the
condition of the pattern under which
condition the pattern has 70 percent win
percentage or 85
winning percentage so you can use that
winning percentage to add 35
how much size you want to size into
different trade anywhere between one to
one
one to two and one two three the higher
the winning percentage the pattern is
the more size you can go in
that's how you really grow your account
pretty much in the most
efficient way so that will be all the
tips i want to give today thank you very
much for watching
and hopefully these tips are helpful for
you as a beginner
and i will see you guys next time

SOURCE VIDEO: The 3 habits that will make you a better trader [V-GQcdlpvOA].en.vtt
================================================

Language: en
hello guys steven dexter million dollar
trader and semi starcraft 2 pro players
here
and for you guys who don't know me uh
you can find out my trades in my website
and i post my account statements pretty
much everywhere on social media
so today's topic we're going to talk
about the three habits that you need to
become a consistent profitable trader so
let's get into the video in the
beginning my trading is not structured
and consistent and i see a lot of new
traders coming into the market with the
same issue it wasn't until i traded for
about seven years that i had gradually
shipped my habits and daily routine into
the most consistent and most beneficial
in trading
there's going to be three habits that
you need to become a consistent
profitable trader so the first habit you
need is you have to wake up anywhere
between 8 to 8 30 am because the market
opens at 9 30.
that's number one so you have to become
a morning person get up and borrow
shares and to see
and prepare what you need to do and to
see what type of pattern that fits in
different takers do your preparations
takes about anywhere between 20 to 30
minutes
whenever you are started trading but for
now it takes about maybe five minutes
the most
so
after your preparations uh you either
decide you want to go long or go short
and one of the most important thing is
once you either borrow shares or you
made your plan try not to take an entry
right after market open because normally
the first five minutes after market open
it is very dangerous to pick an entry
and also you always actually get trapped
in the first i would say 15 minutes
after market open so personally for me
i do anywhere between
10 30 to 11 30 a.m to pick the best
entry i think that's where
all the adrenaline
of
newbie traders finishes their buying and
selling and that's where the pattern
will slowly to appear
and you can take your entry and make
your profit from there now the second
point is a specific routine
so i had a really bad habit when i was a
beginner is whenever i wake up i'm
meaning a short sitter right
so i do about eight times shorting
out of 10 times i'm trading
so i wake up early and i borrow my
shares and i couldn't stop myself
shorting in the pre-market now that's
one of the biggest problem that i had
when i was a beginner so what i did is
have to force myself for my shares and
then i'll go for a run or play a video
games to skip that time in the
pre-market so i can focus after market
open
whatever method works for you you have
to
recognize your problem especially that
do not try to enter too early not enter
too late by having that rush of trading
uh before 9 30. different people have
different method but find a method that
works for you so you can stop over
trading before the market even opens so
the last habit it sounds that it's not
that important but i think it plays one
of the major factors
if you want to be stay fresh-mandated
and wake up early and to be able to do
your work is to find some type of hobby
outside of trading because uh trading
you're looking at virtual stuff there
it's all numbers it's all charts
and you sometimes to get out of that
mind and to get out of that stock market
zone
you have to find something to do either
go for a round or have some sports and
play video games
once you switch the different thinking
process you will feel actually much
better
especially whenever you take a huge loss
and that's where you need to stop and
think what did i do wrong not in getting
stuck in that type of emotion is how do
i make my money back so
that's one of the very important factors
that i have encountered uh in the course
of my trading career so those are the
three habits that you need to become a
consistent profitable trader uh if you
have any questions please leave a

SOURCE VIDEO: The 3 mistakes EVERY trader will run into. [lhhMdUGcoZk].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let's go guys Steven duck search so
today I'm going to talk about the five
common mistakes were going to make in
your trading career and in this video
I'm going to talk about as a trader and
as a teacher in both perspective to
really help you to lead you to become a
consistent trader so first of all let's
go back into 2016 at that time I was a
trader just got into the trading career
in the first six months I was tracking
statistics I have already about 30 to 40
samples and they're very confident at
that time to really trade my own pattern
now once I stick to my own pattern and I
made about 30,000 40,000 ish then I'm
that type of person I always like to go
into you know different sectors to
discover new patterns and maybe new
method to really trading this market so
I discovered one of the repeatable
pattern that most of the realm doesn't
really run over 200 to 300 percent in
one day but I only have living amount of
data that I can access to once I see a
runner if it's reaching about 200% 300%
I will start to short it I don't know
why and that's how my stats work is
telling me back into the beginner stage
I don't really have a clear
understanding of what market cap and
throat is so I don't know how much
volume will affect all those little
market cap and figure market caps
because as I talked about in the
previous video where volumes trading on
intraday will affect the winning
percentage and it spike in percentage in
that one day let's say a little
15-minute volume on this intraday we
only have about 2 million flow maybe 3
mineral that will massively affect how
to stock would be trading and what's the
maximum winning percentage along with
the maximum spiking percentage so in
that first few month I don't really have
a system to trade with once I had a few
wins about nine to seven wins I got very
overconfident
I was shorting anything that was spiking
around 200% to 300% I ran into GB I now
I don't really know what low-floor can
do what's the maximum potential so the
stock started at 20 cents inspected to
$2.00 inspector already by thousand
percent at that point I know there's a
rule never showing to me
day and avoid completely in the midday
timezone I end in afternoon so I start
showing that to the slapper about 85 and
I was keep adding I was thinking that
there's no way to suck and go above
2,000 percent 3,000 percent this data is
already breaking my understanding of no
general maximum spiking percentage I was
still being stubborn trying to fight the
stop being angry with the stock I think
the stick has something to do with me at
that time I wasn't really thinking in
terms of pattern I was thinking about
you know how to revenge the stock then I
have about $60,000 account I was down
50,000 years and I was lucky stop their
father and drop back to $3 then
eventually drop back to 2 so I was be
able to you know bake on my burning back
and be able to carry even so number one
rule as a beginner your trading career
do not be overconfident
as a beginner trader you will be able to
find a useful pattern in about the first
two founders or three months and you
will be able to stick it for a while and
once you trade about seven nine ten
trades you will start Gilbert confident
that's where the most traders fail it's
because once they get overconfident then
they think they want to discover the
maximum potential or we can you know
give from a one trade there was has been
really big and once the stock reverses
that one loss can pretty much overwhelm
the first wins you have so that's one
number one lessons that everybody runs
into you so I hope you guys can avoid
that and the first sign can see is you
are setting in bigger and bigger
second sign you are seeing you will be
you want to really figure out what's the
maximum rework and get one stock because
it's a human nature curiosities and
greed I always run into that type of
problem and still I run into nowadays so
it's very difficult to control but I
hope you guys can notice the sign before
that happened so you can avoid that huge
mistakes it's going to happen every 10
or 20 trade so that's where
overconfidence now over trading will be
the second problem you're going to run
into as a beginners this is a same old
term over trading over trading over
trading is no
can actually avoid that because as a
human you are not the perfect robot you
cannot trade the perfect pattern again
and again you're now willing to wait I
run into this type of problem pretty
much about four to five times per year
and not each season when I run to over
trading I take about 40 to 50,000 losses
for no reason
now each year I've been getting better
and better and trying to come at trades
less and less so what I noticed from the
last couple years you will be there's
only several good opportunities happens
within a year and there's about twenty
to thirty perfect trades happens in
about two hundred some trading days and
that means you can only place one trade
every six days so with a pattern day
trader rules I don't really understand
that people wants to only live to that
type of rules at the beginning I was
very annoyed with parent day trader
rules it's because that if you don't
have the ability to trade or the freedom
to trade ahow Keynes supposed to make
money now after a few years I understand
why there's a rule was placed down at
25,000 so let me give you examples about
how over trading is happening without
you noticing and let's talk about Tesla
Tesla was spiking from 300 to 900
dollars in the last cup of month now
everybody started to get excited and
hyping it up when the news was so big
you always do the opposite ways let's
say Tesla running from $800 to $1,000
everybody was excited on Twitter now we
got today
he dropped about 20% when you are seeing
of crowded trades we are seeing a stock
piece but spiking from 27 to $5 bringing
about 5,000 percent or 10,000 percent
that's where need to stay away so number
one if the stock is trading a lot of on
let's say a hundred million 200 million
volume the reason why it tracks long is
because everybody's talked about it you
feel like you want to anticipate the
stock especially when it starts getting
crowded in on the first screen day
that's where most people lose money only
10% people can maybe gain some type of
money in the first screen day if the
starts getting really crowded
now when you start spiking 3,000 percent
four thousand percent without any type
of edge that's where it gets dangerous
too because you will attract more volume
so those type of varmints are people who
don't
Halla trade and their anticipate in then
end up taking a huge loss after they
finish the trade so that's going to be
the second mistakes you're going to make
in your trading career the correct way
to really avoid these type of mistakes
is to really figure it out what's the
best trade within a year now from that
past year I've been tracking statistics
there's only about twenty to thirty best
trades and there's about 20
another opportunities that consider it's
not a perfect trade but you can still
trade it so overall total 40 to 50
opportunities you can get per year and
it's considered to be a good opportunity
and how do you suggest write down the
rules and always follow your rule that
you write it down if you break the rule
that's not a rule anymore
I see people breaking the rule all the
time and they want to discover the
maximum potential on the trade I would
really do that on a paper trade instead
of putting into real time first regular
rule down secondly see you are following
the rules the third I want to talk about
market cycle now market cycle usually
happens when the stock is getting hyped
up into several sectors but wuhan buyers
will be the one sector that was hyped up
recently then shipping sector helped out
back in 2016 followed with Bitcoin so
all those three major hype are causing
all those market cycles when buyers are
coming into this new sector that was
recommended by other people
newbies wanting to trade because they
are seeing the potential of the style
varying from maybe the one to twelve
dollars so once they see the potential
they want to anticipate and end up
losing money now including us as a day
trader as people wants to make this at
their full career and people will get
filtered out consistently in two
different seasons now every single year
there will be about four hives within
the year let's say one low flow just
rearranged node two one two seventy
dollars and it will bring all those
sympathy players along with him and make
all those stickers go 2,000 3,000
percent now into all these hives and
will bring new buyers will bring new
short sellers and people are fighting
back and forth in the first green day
trying to compete now who is going to
wane and we are anticipating all those
first green day especially with no edge
without statistics
you're likely to lose once you lose you
get filtered out of this market so back
in 2016 as a beginner when I see this
type of hype I was getting saturated
because there's so much action there's
so much opportunities I can really get
we are seeing this type of hyped up
sector all those patterns will get
readjusted a little bit because we are
trying to adapt to the market in two
different seasons you have to really
notice that what type of time zone is
considered to be a hyped up time zone
what type of time zones consider as a
normal market and you can pretty much
notice when the stock is going out of
the normal statistic stat let's say the
stock going from 1 to 50 or 1 to 70 and
ran from overall 7,000 percent and
that's not wrong when you are seeing
Simplot a player game bring along with
this major Spikers then that's a
definite sign that this is a hottub
sector and you won't know there will be
a lot of buyers and sellers involving
into this type of mass amount of volume
the correct way to really trade it is to
not touch these type of sector until
they finished hyped up because once you
know when sector is hot tub first of all
you will track so much volume second you
will attract so much buyers third you
know pretty much all phone windows are
trash and when you know the fundamentals
are trash that they will eventually drop
back where they begin then you can use
the buyer previously to shore into the
resistance and that's why resistance
works pretty much all the time the
respect after the height will be the
moneymaker after the high above 90% of
people that jumped into the first type
will lose money so that's we call the
market cycle that's why only 10% people
makes money in the market 90% people
losing the market so all those three
things I have talked about are pretty
much the cause of human nature greed
overconfidence and over trading and be
willing to anticipate because other
people are trying to trade as well
always write down your rules follow your
rules and be as a robot as possible and
they also listed some signs that you can
find out before you make the major
mistakes so that's pretty much all for
this video hopefully this video is
helpful as a beginner please write down
your rules and be disciplined and learn
from other traders the thing I learned
from other traders is I've always look
at it
instead of their winnings and that's
where you can improve yourself as a
better trader so that be it thank you
very much and I'll see you guys in the
next video

SOURCE VIDEO: The 3 trading patterns that need to be adjusted. [Q_CxBtbNuxk].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let's go guys Steven doctor so today's
topic will be what type of patterns been
out there since I started trading and
not a people being asked me that for the
last couple months so I decide to do a
video about it and there is some
patterns are already outdated some of
the pattern that doesn't really exist
anymore so I will be folding some
today's what patterns been changed what
kinda needs to be modified the first
ever video make sure to click the like
button and subscribe also click the link
in bottom to follow my social media so
let's get into the video so today I'm
going to focus on the top three patterns
that's been outdated and needs to be
modified now let's go over the first
thing so a lot of people are asking me
well there's a few patterns on OTC
market there's OTC dividers OTC first
rate is short and it's very difficult
for them to really find the correct
pattern for them to focus on because
that was one of the patterns for Bertoni
there's patterns for other traders that
worked for them back in 2015 or 2016
at that time OTC breakout worked really
well and I do see a lot of OTC breakout
back in the days by now I don't really
see them anymore this is the frequency
problem back in that time they're sort
of promoters and email promotions and
fold promotions at that time as well and
I think the closest ticker dive traded
along with CVS I that one was the OVC
pumping taboo to see my wines not a good
pure pumping down so for that one OTC
dip out really well I know TC parent
worked out as well
- now 2018-2019 have been major to focus
on NASDAQ OTC is kind of what they don't
happen often anymore so a lot of people
are watching the courses or educational
courses on OTC market and I wouldn't
really suggest you focus on that because
that teaches you well how to really find
promoters and how to really find their
emails and how to know when it's going
to down but now when you're trying to
find that type of star view also takes a
lot of time to learn winner yet and the
parent only happens about two three
times a year
it's not gonna be worth it for you to
spend 10 hours 12 hours to really know
it's not really worth it for you to
spend 10 to 12 hours to really learn
that
pattern and to go back in time and play
that same day stocks and practice for
who knows twelve or twenty times now
that's for OTC OTC market doesn't really
exist anymore so if you are trying to
know to see courses out really recommend
data
now let's follow with NASA patterns now
the top three patterns that I have found
and I have been changed for a while well
first is first rate day now a lot of
people watched my previous interviews
and they say oh well first right they do
have 86 winning percentage as a pattern
and followed by the 86 winning
percentage there is a different market
captains for first rate day for example
X 80 when it showed the first red day
right here and this day didn't really go
red because it opened up around 609
closed around about $5 ish so didn't
really go below 5 this is the pre first
right there and this is the first red
day now take a look of after first
Friday because the pattern that way
always being taught is you you want to
shore after first right day because the
stock starts to get bearish X T the
stock went from well 2 to 6 of course is
overextended and after first birthday
the Stettin really break the previous
day low now this is what the patterns
that completely break the first red day
rule it's because well first core first
red day as long as the patterns were
extended which we always learn back in
the days if the stock goes up about two
three hundred percent four hundred
percent doesn't really matter about days
now today for First Friday to be able to
work first he needs to extend at least
three days so for X 80 you already
extended two days which is October 25th
October 28 stock went from 2 to 5 then 5
to 7 and only spiked up two days in 2018
the stock means to you extend three days
for the first rate to be able to your
work so for X 80 specially we are using
first where the pattern you need to be
really careful is because witness
awkwardly shows your first red day and
extended for three days or above that
you can't shore into first after
first-rate day now just look at it if
you show after wrist red day let's say
you sure read into this bounce and four
seventy and get squeezed into five
twenty and down back to 480 so if you
stay for a whole day you won't be able
to make any money and maybe take a small
loss as well that's 4x + UT same thing
goes to Arg X now this ticker actually
extended enough for a few days the stock
had the first green day one two three so
that's three consistent Green Day is
followed with a red red day now after
this first red day the stock did
panicked not that much take a look at
this so the previous data which is 1.9
when you were shooting the first Friday
you won't always fit into a bounce now
let's assume you sure into 2.30 - I'm
covering - 1.9 which you make a little
bit amount of money now this is the not
example for first red data I extended
over three days and you worked pretty
well but there's not much risk reward
because if you take a look at the
extension overall the stock went from 1
to 3 which is only 300 % xn UT 1 from 2
to 7 it's around 300 percent but this
one takes about two days ok artistic
takes about three days now just by
observing those two different tickers
Arg X needs more extensions and the days
are sufficient enough for to use for
spread day for X 80 the extensions are
enough but there's not enough space for
future wise we are looking - sure in the
first red day you need consistently well
3 days above and you needs to be over
300% because we are looking at a rgx the
maximum you were which is from 2:30 to
190 that's only about 40 cents
/ - 30 to 40 knots around 20% maximum
risk reward so whenever it is suggest
shooting - a 300% gain overall I would
be really suggesting that shorting
something that it is over a thousand
percent Celeste
takes about five days or four days run
from one to ten then that's much easier
to surely into that type of pattern
instead of shooting a rgx back to the
topic that was talking about there's two
different market trap zones for a first
rate day now for bigger market caps as I
said in previous video it's really
difficult to drop is because stock
actually has some type of fundamentals
for xng a our jigs are both considered
as a relatively bigger caps which will
affect first rate a pattern maximum risk
reward when I was tracking data as for
bigger market caps the maximum every
school word for first right there which
is around negative 20 something percent
you cannot go under a negative 25
percent for market cap which is lower
something around 20 million 50 meaning
ish when they are super quick Sunday the
winners show the first red day the stock
can go below negative 5% on the day
that's the data you need to track for
bigger market caps and smaller market
caps so in conclusions those are 2
points for first red a needs to be
modified first we'll be ready kappa
zones second will be days of extension
that's what changed in 2018 2019 the
second part I'm going to talk about is
called overstating gap down a lot of
people have heard about this pattern
about two three years ago by right now
Oberstein gap down kind of is getting
outdated but they're still hanging
around there but a lot of the criteria
needs to be changed as well I'll keep on
earning over staying gap down when they
are using it they're wondering why it
doesn't work so I'm going to give few
points ah a lot of people are forgetting
about and some of the points needs to be
modified
f c/e l for example when people are
treating these separate acres they're
using overseeing gap down of course if
the stock is over stained data let's say
the stock went from well the stock moved
from 30 cents to 60 cents so overall up
about 100 percent now stock did gap down
a little bit it opened up probably
negative 3 to 5 percent and people are
using the yesterday consolidation to
shorten Jim well first a lot of people
are I just by looking on the chart if
the stocks Capulet
sucker servicing it's doing opening gap
down because that's completely around
the first very important criteria is
stock needs to be over a hundred percent
in the previous day and the stock
closing and very very strong then
falling the next day the stock is losing
the QWERTY which caused the stock gaps
down trap a bunch of breakout buyers
that trying to sell in the morning spike
but the stock already gapped down so
people are already trapped in the stocks
or what in the stock spike again or can
you sell into the spike to neutralize
their positions to tight even that's the
psychology of agustin gap down but in f
c/e l the stock is a completely
different behaviors because the stock
you know huge morning panic and people
already sold then the stock came back
again trying to do that gap filled
pattern but it turns out didn't the
stock closed below the day high and
that's not considered stock is going
strong and when stock gaps down
he means there's not much bachelors are
trapped on ticker like FC e l we're too
many people using a bursting gap down
think about it because following the
next day the stock is included ease
which means sometimes it's going to
trade a ten times this volume compared
to previous day and majority of the
volume are lean towards too short so
they say ninety percent people are
shorting overstaying gap down and
there's not much back workers when
there's too many people shorting will
likely caused a huge short squeeze and
when the stock is squeezing there's no
backward holders trying to sell thank
you that spike then will cause bigger
squeeze that's why people are
understanding Overson gap down around
because you need back orders for you to
be able to shorten to the morning spike
when there's no back orders you
completely destroyed the psychology of
that pattern so two points needs to be
emphasized first the previous state
needs to be over 100 percent the
secondly the stock has to close strong
to be able to trap people trying to sell
in the next morning spike if it doesn't
then stock concert has overseen job done
so that's all my points on first rate
overstating gap down and my opinion on
OTC market let me know you've any
questions i'd leave a comment below
thank you very much for watching this
video i'll see you guys
next time

so for example when you have a $3,000
account you want to size in 15% to 20%
of your Equity into this specific trade
so section one will be the pattern that
has over 80% winning percentage which
will be first red day bounce Shore
overing gap down second section will be
premarket breakout Panic de by% to 25%
of My Equity you can choose how much you
want to s in in based on the patterns
winning percentage which will give you a
decent risk reward ratio and also um you
can prevent big losses because lower
winning percentage pattern are not very
consistent so you can avoid losses
basically by sing in smaller now for
bigger accounts when you have anywhere
between 1 million to 2 million you want
to sing in uh 800,000 900,000 in one

Language: en
hello guys steven dux here welcome to
this youtube videos i know i haven't
downloaded youtube videos for a while
uh since the market has been very crazy
mass amount of volume and it's very
difficult to predict
so overall of my trading performance
i've made in total of 3 million to 4
million dollars on gme and amc along
let's get into those two tickers and
then we'll talk about other tickers that
was
sympathy play as well so hopefully
you can enjoy this videos i made tons of
mistakes i should make much more money
hopefully you can learn some mistakes
from me i also hope that you traded and
those two tickers
well enough that you didn't get wiped
out by the volatility
so in this video it's very important to
understand how to really manage your
risk and also how to avoid
those type of chances to get blow up
in one day first of all let's go over
amc
this is the main play that happened in
the last few weeks
and you can see that this one actually
ran out before
starting from the 14 area 14 is the
breakout level then it went all the way
to 72.
now this ticker the reason why i
squeezed so many people because this is
normally when you have a billion dollar
cap and you have a 400 million float
that's a lot of shares and basically you
need to
buy the entire float to make sure that
the stock inspect 100
or even more so in this case mc was
basically spiking around 20
to 50 percent per day and the highest
squeezing percentage
happened on thursday which is around
june 2nd
is squeezed over a hundred percent so in
terms of that type of range
this is probably the maximum squeezing
percentage i've ever seen
in this type of market cap in the last
10 years and i was very amazed by it
and i thought that into the thursday our
gap down you can see right here it went
from 44 to 36
now i thought it would be a decent odds
to shorten around 40 risking the
pre-market high
for decent shooting opportunity but it
turns out that the stock was
attracting way too much volume we traded
it 700 million volume in one day
so that's not very ideal for shorting
and stop basically
extended from 36 to 72
then following the next day that the
stock actually got down now this
is i realized i got opportunity short
into it
so for last couple days i had one
attempt
shorting around the 33 area but it
wasn't
a very good odds because there is no
consolidations
there is tons of volume so basically
when
the stock tends to favor the short side
the stock needs to lose liquidity
and amc was actually gaining liquidity
when was
actually dropping so uh that's not very
ideal for that day
now going into uh the final day
so in the pre market the stock actually
dropped through the support you can see
that
the initial support is around 60 to 72
and since i cracked that support i was
aiming to shoot into a morning bounce
using this resistance as my guide
so i entered around 62 covered half
around 41 ish then added
around 51 then added 52 then added 55
so that was three ad and they covered
when stock was trying to break down so
around 39 dollar ish
so for that specific action i made two
million dollars off
it immediately then i was also playing
gme because i
know that amc was leading gme momentum
in this way i was managed to capitalize
on gme scan
i made i think around anywhere between
two hundred thousand to four hundred
thousand
of those two morning action
now the follow-up action actually
surprised me a little bit so once i
added and i shorted it
my average actually got drawn down to
all the way to 53.
now when the stock tends to bounce back
i was
hesitating that if i should add or not
because
normally that stocks bounce about 50
percent
from the panic but in this case they
announced
a completed offering news around 1 pm so
the stock actually
squeezed from the 50 area which is
around
48 to 53 56
and then the stock starts to squeeze
again so in this case
i exited my entire positions i think i
took a
small loss but i still managed to
capitalize to
3 million dollars of those two tickers
now falling to the next day that the
stock actually
came down and started to form its
consolidations so
i think in the following next week we
will have a decent
opportunities to shore around the 50
consolidation area
and i think the momentum has already
gone
and this will be fading all the way back
to the 30 area maybe 31.32
there is massive amount of support
around tony so there's still tons of
range to shortly into
and for people that's going long
mc and going short on amc it doesn't
really matter which side you're on
it's because that there is always a
balance between
the bid and ask if the stock goes up way
too fast there's always
balance that it will cause the stock to
break down
to at least meet that balance point
before you go up to the next level
so for people who are just brittany
going long and buying at 72 dollars
always think about there's going to be a
balance point between the sales and buy
and don't actually chase into the
strength and don't
short into weaknesses because those are
the typical mistakes
that people tend to make so i personally
did not
expect that mc could come back from that
uh massive drop and actually came back
to test its high
so i made a mistake from there other
than that there's tons of data for you
to track because
gme got halted and they prohibited
robinhood people
to actually buy in that day so i
wasn't very sure what's the maximum
dollar block
for this type of market but on amc
there's no halting there's pretty much
natural uh development especially on the
chart
so in this case you can track your data
and to figure out what's your edge and
also
just by looking at the chart actions to
learn that in the next
time when similar ticker like amc
happens
you know exactly what to do so that'll
be all the recaps for this week
hopefully you guys can learn something
from my mistakes and also make sure to
stay safe
and i will see you guys in the next

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let's that student ducks here today
we're gonna talk about a couple of the
play that happened this week and Mark
you started getting very very hot and we
got pretty much a play every single day
we're gonna talk about cover tickers and
into this recap generally including all
types of strategies and hopefully you
guys enjoyed it ot okay this is a decent
BAM short but wasn't a very very bad
about short since the neutralist areas
are around two point no way so when you
are seeing there's a heavy resistance
and there's no volume trading across the
board until Friday then you realize two
dollar area it's very close to $3 area
so the maximum spiking percentage is
around 30% 40% and stop I think it
started spiking at one point 91 so
overall spiked about 40% I think just
will be about 40% so that doesn't really
meet the material but Robichaud needs at
least 50% for the punch of Europe to
work and if it doesn't really meet the
criteria barely meet the criteria the
risk award will get very very strange so
if you take a look of this parabolic
short and short into resistance and you
can see the stop came back from 2.40
wand and never crowd 2.42 per 36 ish and
a late of the day they actually squeezed
so if you're really shorter than let's
say moment and break down around 2.7
2.65 then if you want to have an end of
the day you make nothing because the
risk of war is not there so just be
careful when you are using balance your
strategies always make sure the stats
packs enough Hasker risk award and
trading sytem on a volume if ii started
already trace element of volume let's
say try the Ottoman you know one minion
volume then the stock becomes not
treatable if you're trading too much fun
it says let's say the saturated about 70
million bond today and then if you take
a look at the resistance then the stuff
doesn't really have enough resistance to
hold this is semi minimum volume I
intraday so you've them out too much
make sure Kara losses quickly if the
violence too little
you cannot trade because you affect
about the volatility and you won't be
able to get a very good executions that
well so I mr n is also a gap up short if
you take a look at you your chart and no
resistance whatsoever except this one my
resistant that doesn't really count wait
until the stock forms of correction make
sure to start losing more than 10 then
go ahead and short it so it's say the
correct that was a shorting point is
around this 657 fill perk sometimes you
have to start some low flow you can
spike about 20% to 30% sometimes even a
hundred percent so within this fat half
an hour try to not place any trades
until the stats start to lose this
momentum what do I mean by lose momentum
needs to craft at least 50% for a start
to completely lose momentum then you can
start getting some risk reward over
there if the start even though sometimes
he loses 50% of its own gain so let's
say 739 going back to 521 if he's
trading like this amount of on it they
start trading around 30 million 40
million at 12:45 then you will trade
about 60 million overall so where are
those 20 million 30 million shares I'm
gonna go it's going to trade and if the
stock some low flow you'll cause a high
demand a lot of supplies that goes up
you will play those type of weird action
stats I can read break this morning high
and squeezing after hour so always be
careful with those gap up short I
wouldn't be suggesting training these as
a beginner how I suggest avoiding the
stuff of play without resistance
don't try to guess wait until the stuff
forms a correction make sure this is a
momentum war start spiking the key is
don't try the first 20 minutes until the
start makes its decisions now the last
ticker I'm not gonna talk about MVP this
woman was also a very crowded trades if
the pre-market volume traded too much it
is over 4 million 5 million the stuff
becomes not sure about all if it does
have resistance
so how heavy the resistance is if it the
stack does not have heavy enough
resistance the stacker tends to break of
its own resistance if he is drinking too
much volume the pre-market and were you
looking at four million five million
volumes six million while in the
pre-market don't try to trade just tap a
ticker i assessed and small i need to
the spurt and show it a little bit in
charm in the live trade and covering the
one point eighty years so made 13,000 I
think I made about 18,000 into the
supply always says in very small and
it's not some type of super good risk
award the user start loses its momentum
at the first couple candles you don't
get that much risk award so always has
in small if you have resistance that's
better you can say never be more if it
doesn't have resistance make sure it's
sizing small and since you don't have
that much risk reward so make sure cover
I mean to witness along the way into the
close don't hold everything at the close
because that's one of the pressure risk
as well now let's talk about SIA SIA is
one of the very low flow that happened
last week as I talked about it this one
doesn't really have a consoling
resistance so if the stock returns to
spike again fat daughter will be not
that heavy resistance it has one little
bit conservative resistance around $4
ish and unto Friday spike said
especially in to this day when the
Suttons to spike and doesn't really meet
the criteria
it doesn't really spiky resistance don't
try to shore into this type of play or
you will become a potential long so if
the stock some SSR and it's too far from
resistance and Scanian volume and in
some micro flow then you will become a
potential arm it will squeeze people
because if the style does not have heavy
enough resistance on micro flow the
start tends to spike
especially on SSR and if you are very
far from the resistance
it's a this resistance around five to
six dollars
then this I said to you will have
another $4 to spike so at this point if
the stock is game volume don't try to
think about shorting try to think about
going along and make sure you have a
decent risk because on this step apply
especially on SSR the starting to drop
fifty percent in one candle out of
nowhere so also include the very very
high risk and let's say if you are at
2.40 a risk in 2.30 and yeah that's a
ridiculous score so the risk is for you
to control and sometimes the stat
doesn't really have a high risk it
depends on how you control the risk so
this is when you want to master winning
stocks Master how to control your risk
first before you go into any patterns
tracking statistics that's the number
one step because that's where you can
achieve consistent profitable very very
quickly after that go into a strategy
increase your winning percentage then go
into specific details to increase your
maximum risk reward that's the three
steps you need to take for you to become
a very good consistent profitable trader

the second discipline I follow is that
once you find the edge you have to
relatively increase your uh trading size
because when you only have a $500
account or $1,000 account it's really
hard to make a $100 a trade or $300 a
trade because at the very beginning you
want to start make some money that's
relative to the account size let's say
that you have a $30,000 account and
you're only making $20 $30 per trade
that will take you a very long time to
um be consistent profitable and get used
to the size that you want to start
making relatively decent money

being patient is the key to witness
[Music]
being patient being patient
bruh hello guys steven ducks here so
today we'll be talking about the current
market conditions and how to really
trade
correctly in current market cycles what
do i mean by market cycles
now a lot of people think about okay the
market is going to
last pretty much the same during the
year and
personally i've been trading over five
to six years and there's a lot of
actions going on
you have to basically adjust your
strategies year by year
based on how much volume is trading on
the current market conditions
so let's compare the last three months
and while we are trading
in today's market so back in may june
and july we've been getting anywhere
between
200 million shares to 400 million shares
on one day
now let's look at the examples at kldk
the sticker traded around 200 million
shares around thirty dollars
now thirty times two hundred million
shares that's close to six billion
dollar trade in one day now let's look
at
grnq this sticker traded around 100
million shares
at three dollars so the total dollar has
being traded in that day
is around 300 million so when you see a
dramatic decrease on the volume
by looking at around two weeks of
increments
you can clearly see there's something
going on in there and the kodk basically
wiped out a lot of buyers and sellers
then they want to take a break that's
where the market cycle starts
now let's get into our trading habits so
when you are
short sellers or consist any profitable
trader
especially we on a winning streak
it's really easy to make that type of
mistakes because you
think the current market conditions did
not change
and you want to make the same amount of
risk or same amount of size
to risk into a ticker then that's where
you start to make your first mistakes
because personally i did make a lot of
mistakes like that
as i said in the previous video the
biggest losses come after the biggest
win
after when you enter into a market cycle
you have to be
really really careful with how you're
supposed to set a name
and the second point you want to look at
in terms of statistics
when you are entering into a new market
cycles
and you see there's dramatic volume
decrease
and you want to compare okay so am i
entering the next market cycle or not
because you don't want to make the
mistakes that you want to adjust your
size or just your risk
kodk as i said traded about six billion
dollars in one day
now we're beginning around 600 million
dollars in one day so that's a
big bond decrease and we can use that
statistics to
basically tell us that we're entering
into a new market cycle
now statistics performs very different
when you are entering
a completely new area because when you
are shorting into resistance
especially like mtp and grnq
these type of tickers do have a tons of
resistance but
in average statistics that typical
bouncer only can bounce
up to 70 percent from the resistance
when we're entering a new
cycle that buyers and sellers are too
eager to get into a trade
because they think the market is still
the same so
mtp and grnq almost bounce up to 100
to the resistance point if you're not
careful you're basically risking another
20 to 30 percent
losses from your original positions so
my solution will be i tend to avoid the
first
or second play if there's a really
boring market
lasted for about two to three weeks you
want to avoid the first
or second heavy volume traded ticker
because all these type of pattern will
perform really weird
because people are trying to get in very
very fast
the last point i want to make is the
psychology behind
these type of tickers when you are so
used to
one market your brain is said to i want
to trade
the same way that i traded for the last
two weeks
so when i sizing into one point and i
see a very boring market
everybody wants to go in and make their
consistent again
and potentially more profits and that's
where you are making the first mistakes
as a patient consistently profitable
trader
you are basically taking advantage from
the first wave of people making their
mistakes to create
opportunities for you that you can take
advantage of
so that type of psychology is very
important
and that is one of the major reasons i
avoid the first or second play
so let's look at grnq this is a bounce
short that traded
tons of volume which is the second play
after mtp
you can see the volume traded much more
than the resistance volume
normally by average statistics the stock
can only bounce up to
70 to 80 percent from the resistance so
average pushing is around 2.5 or 2.4
the resistance points at 2.8 you
actually respect it all the way to 3
then dumped it all the way to 1.5
so this is one of the outliers that
happens in the market
especially when we're entering into a
new market a lot of people are eager to
short into it
and a lot of people wants to make some
type of action that's why it's going to
make the chart
much harder to predict compared to usual
so there's not much going on this month
and i personally tracked a lot of
statistics
in different market cycles these type of
boring sessions
normally last about two to three weeks
sometimes a month or two
it doesn't last very long especially
where in 2020
just make sure be patient and when you
see a dramatic change on the volume
always wait until the third place comes
out
that can keep you from making mistakes
and also
potentially can save you a lot of money
so hopefully my advice are helpful
and being patient is the key to win in
this market so that's it for this video

able to figure out different patterns
and develop different strategies overall
so today i'm going to give you a very
slow and very detailed overall tracking
sheets hopefully you can enjoy watching
this and while we're in quarantine
so other than playing video games and
getting salty let's get into the video
so before i start this video this
statistic sheets is coming from my
students and i taught him a bunch of
tracking basics and right here i'm going
to give you some of the stuff he did
really good some of the stuff he has to
improve and something the heat they're
wrong
so overall make sure take this as a
learning experience and it's going to be
really good experience for you as a
beginner and especially when you're
trying to develop your own strategies
going along or short since we're in this
corner virus epidemic and there's going
to be a lot of volatilities and
potential opportunities for you to be
able to take advantage on and it's going
to deal shoots and see what we can do
now and it's getting to the sheets and
see what we can find out so while you
are looking at these sheets first of all
as I said they taker and press and press
out those are simulations those are not
accurate performances for you you have
to keep a separate sheets for yourself
that when you are placed this type of
trades and you're pressing and press L
are completely different from the
perfect present press out so in the
future we are looking at the ideal
president press l and you can figure it
out there's a way to improve your entry
and exit overall so the pricing and
press are simulations they takers has to
be very accurate and in the future once
you have two different sheets you can
compare with each other to figure out
what your raw material
you can do to improve your entry and
exit overall so the next thing you want
to track will be profit loss so profit
loss is how much you supposed to do when
the stock goes off your risk level with
the privacy's that means how much you
already lost with the positive ones how
much you gained and profit loss
percentages is how much you lost based
on the overall positions so daily volume
also has to be tracked as well
delivering are very important especially
to tell the stockings crowded or not and
also how many times you throw rotate
throw rotation are very different
compared to what we used to experience
for rotation is basically that how much
volume is traded on the day for example
10 miniature traded for the day and we
have overall two miniatures in the flow
so 10 divided by 2 5 times flow
rotations so that's very simple math and
you can pretty much do all the flow
rotations for or pretty much all tickers
now for rotation typically happens on
lower floats because or floats generally
have lower supplies and featuring
tons of volume there tends to rotate a
lot of times that's where you have to
pay attention to I will get into that
later and let's move forward into the
next couple categories so market cap are
very accurate I have to track go into
the SEC filings or if in this or Yahoo
Finance those are the three website can
get the accurate flow and cap so flow
categories is something that I placed
around myself 0 to 2 millions considered
to be micro flow or nano flow 2 to 5
millions considered to be low flow 2 or
3 million will be a little bit weird
between that gap of micro flow and then
afloat once we go about 5 million it's
not considered to be low flow once we go
over 10 million it's not a low flow
anymore you can see right here between 1
to 2.9 million
those are microphones now greater than
10 million right here those are not low
floats so as you can see my student you
can see the date' ticker press and press
L prime profit loss profile as
percentages daily volume market cap
money tab categories all these type of
cons has to be separated into a
different sheet I had to list them very
specific you want to sell for
all the takers dies Oh greater than 10
million flow you want to put them in one
sheets and all the ticker that is around
1 to 2 million flow play them in that
era sheets between 3 of 10 million in
the night sheets we already will have
three sheets together once you track
about hundred tickers for each sheets
you will be able to track what's the
maximum squeezing percentage when the
stock beats their own criteria because
they're all in the same flood zones so
their action are very similar when
they're reading the same criteria that's
how you be able to read out the price
actions and a lot of people are asking
what stock is not predictable in this
case it's predictable because once you
split them into very detailed categories
and they have very similar conditions
similar market caps I'm gonna float and
similar price actions and you will be
able to tell what's going to happen in
the next few hours that's the overall
statistic sheets you have to begin with
for more detailed strategies I wouldn't
really recommend for beginners if you
want to start somewhere and this is
where you should start you should follow
with the day keep tracking for all the
tickers that is over 20% have some type
of strategy in there or it's doing some
repeatable actions that you see when the
market is open and once you put all
those stickers you can find similarities
if you're dumb and you just disregard
all those tickers and after you track
about six months you will find something
that you could take advantage of
especially morning spike morning panic
both of the pattern happens in the
morning of course between 9 to 11 as I
said being a part-time trader will be
the best way for you especially when
you're a beginners and we're seeing so
much actions during the day and you want
arbitrary you want to make money and
that's where FOMO gets to you so 9 to 11
are the best time to trade if you want
to still want to trade
turn off the platforms and start working
on your sheets to be able to grow small
count you need a simulation so you want
to know what's going to happen in the
next year or two so you will be able to
prepare for that before it happens so in
here I'm going to give you a decent
simulations and also the calculation of
how
fasiqun guru account within certain time
and certain amount to see if you can
meet expectations or not so let's get
into the sheets again and calculation
for bounce or gap up short first right
those are all my patterns so if I don't
learn there's too much to explain I know
and that's the car behind me about short
calculations for a bounce or gap
optional first read day those are all my
patterns so if your honor get into this
patterns there's too much to explain and
let's get into the profit calculations
so profit calculations is something that
I built for myself
and I will put my patterns into
different categories so when I'm seeing
about Shore or a gap up Shore or
first-rate day individual patterns have
its own individual greeny percentages
now for what we need percent in just
over 80 percent or 90 percent extremely
high we can place them into category one
now follow with the lower winning
percentage categories will be first
birthday or sitting gap downfall of it
that will be kept up short without
resistance
basically category one will have the
highest winning percentage category two
will be around I would say seventy to
eighty percent category will be
definitely 80 percent more plus or
ninety percent plus category three will
be 65 to 70 category four will be 55 to
60 once you listed all those categories
you want to really maximize your profits
for the higher winning percentage
pattern as in category one I want to
place more shares or maybe put more
money down because it has much higher
winning percentage so I will be able to
maximum a reward category two same thing
I only put less money compared to
category one because it has the best
winning percentage so in this case I
will be able to maximum a reward and
minimize my losses so once we have that
we want to decide how much money we want
to put into category one two three four
and this is the simulations that we have
so the chances were based around 5500
and I want to since you have a small
town and this is where it gets a little
bit tricky so for a smaller account you
first so afraid to lose and since you
don't really have
my chance for screwing up I would highly
recommend only focus on category 1 and
category 2 next thing we want to do
we'll be tracking the frequency of
category 1 2 within the during the year
so we want to know how many times this
pattern happens per year let's assume 20
times a year the category will be 30
times so overall you will be trading 50
times a year during 252 trading days now
this is where you want to set your risk
level risk management will become pretty
different story after the data sheets I
will talk about in the next few videos
but that's getting into without risk
management and certainly you should have
a maximum knows each trader should be
able to risk $200 or $300 or $500 for
over your account size once you have
your account size how much dollars use
what's your profits supposed to be so
you can see with the perfect trades you
can turn about $5,000 ish into $50,000
within 26 trades because it's like a
snowball once you have higher capitals
you will be able to have more money to
be able to trade with and that also
increases your profits as well without
any type of screwing up or for moreover
trading you will be able to turn 5000 to
1 million over in about 100 trades now
of course we're all human we're not the
perfect robots we'll be able to make
mistakes sometimes we get bad news
Wilbur trade and this is where you have
to stay very disciplined because you
have the simulations you know the
frequency how many times it happens per
year and you also know what's the risk
reward and you also know how much you
suppose the sizing name so once you have
the simulations and you have that number
in your head the profit the risk how
much money is supposed to put it in and
what's the result is going to come now
after a year once you have everything
and you will significantly reduce how
much you want to trade during a day
especially where you have a formal so
over all the statistics from the student
is pretty good and the only thing he
needs to track is he needs to split all
those tickers that is in different
categories often between one to two
point nine of the tickers between three
to ten meeting of the tickers above 10
medium once he track all of that he
needs to track for specific price
actions to be able to increase his
winning percentages what's the maximum
squeezing percentages what's the maximum
point to take profits from so this is a
brass bed sheets
it's not super detailed the profit
calculation is pretty accurate so I like
that he still had a lot of work to do
but for beginners this is very
sufficient for you guys especially when
you're just trying to start so do your
shoes first name you know you have any
questions please leave a comment below
and I'll get to you as soon as possible
thank you for watching this video I will
see you guys in the next one

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let's go guys Steven duck sir welcome to
the new YouTube video this week so today
I'm gonna talk about a really hot ticker
which is called our kDa and a lot of my
students that made same mistakes on
Arkadia when people make their first
mistake stands to make another mistakes
again especially on the same day so just
be very careful if you made your
mistakes let's say you took a huge loss
on some ticker and stock is still
running and never try to place a second
carry them especially on something like
a multi-day runner or a huge runner with
tiny flow like our kDa before we get
into our kDa weather conference coming
up into the next week it's literally the
last minute make sure register tickets
I'll put a link below so what about two
tickers this week and one of the hardest
one is Arcadia of course if you take a
look at the chart stock was trading huge
volume Friday last week and you trade it
all up on a Monday now it's took a deep
dive into chart witness up does a panic
when it starts to gap up people are too
eager to shorting do something like this
shorting to a perk and personally I did
as well I showed it around 3 I think was
around high 3 so 306 somewhere at that
305 and then stock was panicking like
usual are like a failed cat hop short
just straight out okay and the start did
panic little bit and when you start to
crack the support around
2.73 I can see this tiny little bit
difference
it goes to one-minute chart you can see
a little bit clearly once it cracked
through that 2.73 and tends to crack new
lows and it took really think volume to
almost gained up enough over 75% of this
entire again I mean oh I'm sorry for
this entire panic so whenever you see a
panic a major panic something like very
heavy volume 600k 500k and star tends to
come back with really same volume
and the stock tends to come back with
really thin value and that's where you
should be aware of potential squeezes
coming so when the stock gets about
three I think goes around to 89 I
started covering my shares as soon as I
covered and it's like did a huge squeeze
almost 23.5 now in this type of
situation you have to be very clear
trying to understand where the short
seller is and where the buyer is because
when the stud does this kind of huge
movements the ticker is very very
emotional there's gonna be very fast
panic this is gonna be very fast bikes
now especially in this case
so first the start tends to break out of
the pre-market high becomes a pre market
break Ellen's number one second the
stock is breaking against gaining
liquidity throughout the time so when
the stock is getting pretty which means
it's driving more buyers into this chart
or into the sticker the stock case tends
to trade more volume than usual when the
stock is getting tons of volume and some
low flow the stock tends to remain
bullish throughout the day then take a
look at the chart if you see this huge
spike you can see short sellers are
covering very very fast because they're
nervous of stock tends to break out
again
now when satisfies this fast and getting
quoted you know there's other short
sellers are still stuck in this chart
sucking right around 2.8 2.9 so when
they stock they want to get out and
wouldn't start tends to panic you know
they also want to get out that's why
panic always holds in these type of
charts you can see people shooting
around
bid 3 or lower 3 let's draw a horizontal
line so average shorts appear around
3:00 3:30 when the stock does a panic
let's say if I showed it around 3:30 and
that tends to panic into my level what I
want to do is I just want cut even and
be done with it because I don't want to
try to show this chart anymore or people
start adding so the first mentality
people wants to cut even and when I
cover into a panic will causing a buying
pressure and that bottom pressure will
form a support for
heart so you can see multiple times to
stop panicked into this 3.7 area you
held about five times because there's so
many short sellers I've got stuck around
Laura 3ish and the son never attends to
come back and people are still shorting
or adding then there's caused a multi
layer of short sellers there's gonna be
people shorting around to 220 there some
people already shorted around $3 ish so
it's causing a layer of short sellers
getting squeezed
it's talk about chain reactions so when
the stock tends to panic and the first
level of short sellers are so close to
second layer of short sellers so which
is right here this is the first level
this will be the second level so when
those two level are very close to each
other remember this the stock is very
unlikely to come back down so in this
case I was tempted to go long on Arkadia
but there's Warren's $5 ish so I don't
really wake up and see the stock is
exercising warrants and potential
offering going on that's why I didn't go
long overnight but you capped out in the
morning and you went to six and today it
was a massive headache which people
buying and selling since there's so many
locked or got by it out around this area
and people still looking to break even
and start to break again so six star
becomes another support about me around
here $4 there's another $4 support so
dip will be around $6 the high of the
consolidation will be sick for 60 so $6
it's pretty close to 460 so when I start
tends to panic
let's hit the stop rent about three to
five days and when they drop into a
support it's going to be very difficult
to crash first you cannot practice six
hours support first then it's going to
crack this $4 support second and since
those two layers support really close to
each other and
sound like her to crack if you take a
look at our PDA when the stock goes
ready just look at the chart aside panic
panic panic then tends to squeeze before
the market close so this is the type of
multi tier runner that you have to be
very very careful with I will link
towards along side because I don't
really just go on the short side
especially on chart like this
first there is multi-layer support
second the stock is training huge volume
and third when the Suttons the crack
basically in the morning if you're
unsure if the stock goes red
you're basically shorting into you
double area of support you might be a
ghost lane but it's not gonna be like a
fast 50 percent drop in today so on this
chart I'll attempt to stay away unless
this one can spike to like 12 or 13 then
can be sharable again since the price
are far away from these massive support
so that is my thoughts for RK da when a
stock is non-korean enough range and
start its panicking and there's
multi-layer supports gonna take days and
weeks to crack and I don't want to
really hold that long to pay very
expensive pearl fees for future wise if
you guys look at the multi runner like
this not every single movie runner is a
sharable it does have a very good risk
reward I'm talking about intraday
shorting not a swing shorting so this is
the chart that you want to mark as not
really tradable so that is all my
thoughts for RK da if you need something
new press the like button or press the
subscribe button leave a comment below
about what I wanted me to talk about
next time and if you guys wanna come to
the conference this is the last minute
this is the last minute you've
registered of tickets a be the end of it

SOURCE VIDEO: The Risk of Going Long in Micro Float Stocks (Dux's August Stocks' Recap) [TfTTAVrn0iI].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys Steven Dexter welcome to
the August recap
sorry it's been a bit delayed and today
what I talk about Alber law August and
I'm gonna have a ton to play so not sure
if you're not sure where to start just
watch because we have the very boring
summer April May then June and July
starting from August a lot of place I
have popped up will have CET xrk da d pw
PS TV why am i those are no major place
that happened in August and they are
very difficult to predict so let's talk
about up those stickers and it's also
include couple of tickers from September
let's start with why am i why am i from
1 to 6 this is of officially your first
Green Day and it's considered officially
gap up short as well as you can see the
staff tends to hold in the same level in
the mid day so when you see a star tends
to gap up and holding the same level
again and again and again and never try
to trim down breaking that one specific
support as soon as they start apart and
start up cumene volumes and that's where
you should Colossus on your short
because when it starts to spike you can
see 1 from 3 to almost 6
of course we're now why am i DP ewp STV
auto step attackers they are very tiny
no float so there's only certain amount
of supply very high demand and no one
wants to hold those type of tickers
overnight it's because you are risking
of an intraday offering or risking love
after our offering most of offering
happens during after our pre market
so basically we're holding over now you
are risking after our offering and the
pre market offering so that's why people
wants to sell by the end of the day as
you can see the stop get automated um
went from 6 to 3
so either we are choosing going long or
short make sure to not hold these type
of stocks overnight I have seen people
who number 9 and mince any losses almost
75% of their investment so never try to
buy these type of pinning stocks and
holding overnight it's very very risky
so it's okay to buy in the morning it's
okay to buy in the midday
but never try to hold overnight so
that's for y ma PS TV is another tricky
stats the started also a gap up short
and I pushed a little bit and just
straight squeezed it to almost 15
now this ticker I don't think I found
any shares too short but anyways so stop
1 from 4 to 16 and can see this
consistent downtrend chart wouldn't
start tends to break the support again
and again again so let me show you what
people are thinking so first statins to
pull back secondly holding the same
support third crack a little bit of
support but still holding so when you
see three attempts trying to hold the
support and still not cracking and we
need the risk this reverse this is the
starter sign of being bullish when it
creates our lower low and sunny did not
break the support we need reverse the
trends breaking the previous panic which
is this candle so this is where star
tends to reverse and you can see it
stopped going from 10 to 16 now before I
said never hold this type of stock
overnight I mean it is because even
though if it doesn't you're offering it
has a chance that did not get any volume
in the second day and this day you can
see the start really much less volume
compared to the previous day so when the
stock gets into volume 2 or 3 million
volume compared to the Tony meeting
during Mia monetary on a previous day
the stock tends to crack pretty much
reducers alright so again as you can see
the stock going from almost 16 to to 7
so that taker consider is not really
treatable it's because when you are
trying to shore into a second day and
you're basically shooting into all this
type of support that's why it's re
sharable maybe you can show into this
bounce but this bounce wasn't didn't
bounce that high about probably 40% then
we have this slow grind almost 222 trade
all the way down so this chart very
difficult to trade that's my opinion on
a PS TV so CET X this is a ticker I
really traded because the stock did have
potential resistance in the previous
year
and if you take a look at one your chart
the stock did have some resistance in
July ish in and the debate in Jewish and
also have some resistance yeah we're
talking about August 20th so right
around here is perk its sharable so
truly about nine million shares but
anyways we're talking about this day so
August 17th
I'll gets 22 sorry then if we go back
look at the intraday chart same thing
stock comes right before the market
close so it went from almost three to
two almost very beginning so I shorted
this around three I think I made around
fifty thousand I will go ahead and
verify my trade later
other than that the sticker was pretty
weird and I thought the resistance was
really active around to $60 area it slow
grind get you almost three so I showed
Italy right here and the cover into the
panic then Stockton still stop Brian I
only covered partial and I've cut it out
when this tends to break this to $6.00
area so I can't my losses
I came out with a little bit green then
the status has to consolidate and when
the start decides to crack in through
his support I showed it around three and
covered around two so that was a simple
trade CTX was playing within the
resistance so it's much easier compared
to PS TV and while um I those two
tickers are pretty much not really
predictable until they for musicians
first then you go after to exterior
shooting into the resistance that's for
CET X so f fh l this is another based
breakout so when the stock tends to do a
base to break out it typically doesn't
really get that far and gap about fifty
percent or nearly hundred fifty percent
this is a pattern in my DVD called pre
market breakout if the starting out
capped out high and starts to break out
and get a lot of volume in the first
couple candles you can see the first
candle is like 3.2 million and 3 million
again so that means the stock did not do
any pullback and straight squeezed into
almost 6 dollars so when you're seeing
is large pink and
they they're also involved with short
sellers when there's no pullback it
means there's no room for show service
to cover to cut their losses that also
means there's a lot of short sellers are
holding the back and when I started a
major panic this is where they cover
that means the stock are attempting to
hold its dip you can see the stock hold
this 4.46 for four point 48 for multiple
times then did a very choppy to the
second day and same thing happened on PS
TV super low volume in the secondary day
so we are seeing a super low volume
let's say you can use the first couple
candles to compare the previous day if
the first couple cleaners read about
like say it's 3.2 million and secondary
can the trader about only like two
hundred Cade and there's two hundred
cares 1.6 million so has nowhere to
compare with the previous date volume if
the stock tends to do like a multi day
runner or go even higher the style used
to gain more boring compared to previous
state it means the first couple candles
needs to trade anywhere between like
four million to five million and that
volume will support a static go even
higher but in this case it did not so
that's where if you are going long you
should be very careful with the volume
volume means everything if there is
nobody playing the stock the stock is
likely to drop so that's for FF h l then
we have dpw this one was a tricky one
you gapped up so high to the point now I
don't even know it's treatable it this
is the first chapter that we have in
Tunis I think it was in tune there are
few gathers with having twenty nineteen
that kept over nearly 300 or 400 percent
so this ticker you fade it all day and
didn't really have any attempt of
pushing when the stock gaps up so high
it starts on really considered as a cap
up short any gap ups are considered as a
gap up short needs to gap up within two
hundred percent if the star tends to gap
up over twenty percent and it starts
gonna get really tricky either gonna get
really crowded so DPW is also micro flow
you can see that there's one mean shares
so as considered as a micro flow my
control are always
very dangerous I would not suggest
trading dpw at all so I think there will
be a future balance coming again but
especially when stock gaps up so high
after the reverse split this is where
short sellers blow up their account so
when the stock do a reverse split and it
tends to push it up during the pre
market and gainst on a volume and your
offering right afterwards because when
inside your reverse way they will reduce
their share flow they reduce the amount
of flow that they have typically reduce
about 20 times 30 times then they will
also reduce their market caps and they
will increase their price per share
that means the stock unit does the
reverse but the stock would meet the 9/7
requirements and also the flow through
parallel so if anybody tends to
manipulate this and they have a good
chance of doing offering to take all the
money flowing investors and then the
stock goes back to you like one dollar
or a couple cents again then it will
again into an i reverse split that's how
they take money from investors so if
you're not very experienced with going
long or short on these type of stock and
micro flows do not try to touch it watch
it and track it for at least 50 samples
or 100 samples then go ahead and using
us to play we stopped at ticker
now let's talk about now MDR MDR is
another huge flow huge market cap and
can see this day truly about almost 200
million shares on this day the stock did
a translation crack but in this case
when the stock is trading maximum volume
you want to use volume to compare with
the flow if the flow is about the same
number compared to total volume traded
today it means to flow only rotate about
one time it means there's enough supply
for enough demand and for all the low
flow or micro claps we're talking about
is they do multiple flow rotating per
day that means the volume overwhelms the
amount of supply they have so that will
cause either a massive squeeze or very
choppy chart or a straight parabolic so
MDR
if there is a large amount of flow and
there's a large amount of volume you
want to see how much does it rotate
typically when you rotate
one time is not that polish so the start
tends to drop and also you can see the
stock had a really bearish chart on
first candle a couple days ago he
panicked almost from five to one so you
will know there's a lot of people did
not get out and they're getting now into
this spike and in this case I will not
really recommend shooting and ER or even
going while I am they are very
unpredictable a lot of people are still
showing them as I said level of two are
very different compared to micro flow
and large cap so I'll watch your nerve
and we have a lot of play coming up in
September October and December
especially in November December so that

so to grow a small account what I
consider is anywhere between $3,000 to
$10,000 and I do understand a lot of
people wants to have a decent method
because when you have a small account it
is relatively challenging to grow a
$3,000 account into 30,000 and
potentially into 100,000 but uh there is
a way to do it so I'm today I'm going to
give you the most efficient and most
effective way to grow $3,000 account uh
exponentially to uh High amount so
overall there is a three structures or
three discipline that I follow

hello guys steven dexter welcome to this
youtube videos and this video is going
to be a little bit different
uh because i'm planning to do like a
huge recap
by the end of this year i'm going to
show you how i made
close to seven hundred thousand and if
you wanna manage to borrow fees and
commissions
probably 650 000 in terms of net profit
and i'm going to share some of the
patterns that i use
that can be applied into the next week
or by the end of this year
so we have a lot of tickers to talk
about and make sure hit that like button
and subscribe let's get into the video
so here is my account statement i have
live the login to trade zero site
uh i believe many of you guys pretty
much use trade zero as well
personally i use uh trade zero speed
trader
guardian those are my three priority
brokerage that i personally use
if you wanna look for other options
there's sure traders
there is a center point you can use it
for shorting as well
cobra very good for overnight holding
but
trade zero is one of the main broker
that i use
and here is my account statement so if
you look at the trade zero client portal
uh if i go to the account summary which
will be
2020 on october 20 october you click
search and you'll be getting
this is the entire month page will be in
all if you go to the bottom uh gross
profit will be
690 thousand here is the net profit
scroll down for october is 672 000
and that doesn't include bottles i would
say borrow is around anywhere between
30 000 to 40 000 so in terms of net
profit
by the end of the month you will be 650
thousand
so for specifically this month i will do
a huge recap by the end of this year but
i will use the same method and we'll be
looking at the tickers that we can
apply the same method into the next week
so
that's for the account statements and
let's get into the ticker that can be
potentially
give us tons of gains before 2021.
let's look at overall four tickers
that i picked that has tons of potential
by the
end of this week all those four tickers
which i talked about some of them
partially
they're all multi-day breakouts and
multi-day breakouts
if you haven't checked out the previous
video make sure to check them out i have
listed specific criterias for how to
really spot multi-breakout how to really
look for the perfect
criteria and the perfect condition for
to
get that perfect long positioning once
you already know the criteria and let's
look at
the extensions and how are you be able
to short into this type of place
let's look at cb 80 first we have
extension starting from 4 so you extend
it all the way to 11 which
barely hit the minimum extension for
multi-day breakout
what we know about multi-day breakout is
it needs to extend minimum 300 percent
for you to be able to short that qualify
as a shorting opportunity
uh in this case cpat is considered as a
shorting opportunity
which i didn't really size into because
the
extension is barely the minimum and
let's look at
the intricate chart as well in terms of
15 days
chart you can see this weird breakout in
the afternoon
and it did this massive gap down and
specked back into the major resistance
but
normally in terms of showing to normal
market conditions that
showing into afternoon's breakout does
have really low odds
so make sure don't do that and this one
just strayed
dropped in the next day so that wasn't a
very perfect
first red day short that's why i avoided
it
that's for cpid let's look at other
tickers
solo it's still up trending and this one
will be a good
first red dead shore or a multi-day
runner short
as i said a minimum extension from the
breakout has to be over 300 percent
so when you're looking at the breakout
level which
will be around six minimum extension
front six
has to be three hundred percent above
six so
six times three will be 18 and solo is
currently around 10 dollars so we still
have tons of
potential to go um but that will be on
watch
but soto uh when you are looking at in
terms of market cap
it will take a while to get to 18
because as the market cap
keeps increasing it's going to be harder
and harder
for it to go even higher because as i
said
for a bigger market cap to go 100 200
percent
is going to be much more difficult
compared to what we're being trading
normally if the stock is around three
dollar and the market cap is under
100 million so in terms of entire chart
conditions
solo does have potential for shorting
opportunity but definitely not for long
anymore let's look at sunw and nete
now any te especially when you are
looking
either shortly into resistance or buying
into the breakouts
throughout the entire four years you
have a tons of failed spike
you will have from 25 35 to 5
then you have fail spec right here so
one two three
four five six seven eight nine you have
total
nine failed spikes in the course of four
years
and that normally indicates that the
chart has a difficult time to go
up and hold its own again so when you
are looking for a multi-day breakouts
the chart itself has to show you that
the chart can hold its own game
in terms of rounding in a few days nete
you can as you can see that the chart
normally fail on the second green day or
third green day so
ate in terms of charting history is not
very ideal
sumw this one if you look at a very long
term chart
normally you want to look at in the
course of three to four years
you have a massive resistance around
october
and is slowly grinding into the
resistance
if you haven't checked out the slow
ground videos i have
mentioned about slow grind normally are
extremely difficult to short into
and also they are the only condition
that stock can potentially break through
heavy resistance
so sunw is showing that
it's slow grinding which emits the one
and only condition
can break through massive resistance
which suv
is currently doing so in terms of
breakout advantage that you can take
in the future of course into the next
week you are looking for a main
consolidation breakout you're
not normally looking for the day hybrid
account so
what do i mean by that let's take a look
at into
intraday charts so major consolidation
for su
w is landed right around
5.4 so you can see there's a mass
consolidations
around 5.4 then mass consolidation is
around
4. stock is currently around 545.
it's hitting the resistance and didn't
really show you there's a clear breakout
yet
so in the future the key area you want
to look for
is to break through that 5.45 area
to show you that the stock has its
potential to break through
the massive resistance so first unw
i think it does have the highest odds
out of those
four tickers for potential long and once
it gets
very extended off that major support
then it turns into
a potential short as i said minimum
extensions
at least 300 percent so that will be
all the analysis for next week if you
have any questions please leave a
comment below
i'll definitely answer your questions
happy thanksgiving i will see you guys
in the next video

SOURCE VIDEO: The beginner trading psychology that's often overlooked. [-pnm2pwBDks].en.vtt
================================================

that's one of the worst mentality you
will have
hello Steven doctor so today's mean poem
will be meaning Turing training
psychology and I do know there's a lot
of takers been happening for the last
few weeks and I had a really good
June slash beginning of July overall
profit is close to 1.2 million I can't
want to push that to a monthly recap
there's the other stuff I'm going to
cover by today's video we'll be covering
four points related to trading
psychology and I'm going to give some
suggestions to you guys especially for
beginners are just started in this
training industry so the first point on
the cover will be trading confidence
backing when I started trading five
years ago there's a huge problem related
to trading confidence now even though
when I know a patterns going to work now
it's going to pull back to the maximum
reward and they still don't hold as long
as I should now you men should I get to
taking profits way too early or cutting
my losses way too late so that's one of
the biggest problem I had at the
beginning so the only way and the
correct way to approach that is to track
enough statistics now minimum samples
per pattern will be 100 samples
I know people not been tracking random
stuff and they're tracking
billion-dollar cap and smaller cap at
the same time that doesn't really work
you have to put them into different
categories which I talked about in the
last few videos so make sure go back and
look at our statistic videos and figure
out how you supposed to track your
statistics as I said the very beginning
when you are tracking our patterns
you only need to focus one or two
patterns now the best will be one
pattern for you to grow your small count
into a median counts I will say if you
are anywhere between 3 K to 30 K I only
suggest the track 1 pattern first and
start testing the water growing your
size in terms of regaining your risk
award so in that way you won't be as
afraid to touch any other patterns you
don't really know about meanwhile we can
track the other statistics for other
patterns but only focus on one then once
you get to bigger accounts you have the
chance to go
for other patterns to get more profits
but with really small can the beginning
you don't really have a chance if you
screw up you don't get a second chance
so that's one of the most important tips
I'm gonna give you guys do not risk
multiple patterns at once especially at
the beginning so the second point wanna
make is fear of missing now this is one
of the most common mistakes that every
single trader make personally I made
multiple times in my trading career save
10 or 20 times now to describe these
type of mistakes is you personally miss
the trade you want to make your trade
money back assume you already made money
on the first trade since you missed our
profit you want to increase your size on
the next trade and then to be able to
make more profit you think the market
owes you money in that way that's one of
the worst mentality you will have my
suggestion will be at the beginning you
need to go back your basics and start
tracking statistics in two different
ways you want to track the frequency of
the pattern how many times it happened
per year you want to track ok what's the
average you reward I could get from one
pattern so you will be able to generate
a simulate again per year to really get
rid of that type of mistake
because if you know how much money can
make per year then fear of missing out
won't really affect you as much
personally for me it's worked out really
well and I think you should do it as
well this is how I really get rid of
this type of emotion to become a much
better trader than I was before
the third point wanna make is also the
common mistakes that everybody make is
when you are just getting into the
trading industries if you're looking at
on social medias and you see a lot of
people making money and posting their
gains making hundreds and thousands of
dollars and you're just a beginner
now that type of thing will give you
some type of FOMO to place your trade to
make your trading results better and
then you supposed to what will happen
will be ok so this is how much money I
want to focus on to make this month in
that way you will never get to where
your goal is because
you're way focused on the results
instead of focus on the process now the
process is you have to track your
statistics to become a better trader you
have to also practice within level twos
have more market experience just to have
better experience in general to become a
better trader now to focus in the
process instead of focus on the results
will make you much better trader then
just focus on the money this is one
examples so when I'm trading a pattern
I'd always tend to cover in my
unrealized profit so I don't really know
how much am I making the main focus for
me will be focused on the pattern
development let's say the average
weekend for this pattern would be 25 to
30 percent now if I see okay well I'm up
about ninety nine thousand I'm a
thousand dollar away from making a
hundred thousand and I want to wait
until that thousand dollar happened
before I cover in a position to get that
a hundred thousand see in this case I'm
a way too focused on making a hundred
thousand dollars instead of focus on the
pattern now the pattern tells me okay I
should cover today's game will be 99
thousand so instead I want to be more
greed than want to cover to make a
hundred thousand most of the time you
will not end up making a hundred
thousand dollars will end up making
seventy eighty thousand much less than
what the average statistics is supposed
to tell you and that do you understand
there's a big struggle focus on the
results and people come into the market
to make money try your best to focus on
the process because this is the only way
for you to become a better trader now
the last thing I'll cover will be
emotional limits this is something that
I found out personally for myself that
when I'm looking at other better traders
right I'm looking at how they're
supposed to trade going back their
entries and exits figure out okay what's
their thinking process how much others
hasn't into if there are sizing then
about fifty thousand dollars right now
according to my account I only have
fifty thousand dollars let's assume and
I want two thousand fifty thousand
dollars to make the same profit as him
now the results will come outcome pretty
different you will have the patience to
hold that ticker for one or two days I
don't because $50,000 is in my entire
account and I cannot risk a single perk
or single drop so every single movement
will make me really emotional than every
single movement for him it's part of the
pattern because he's thinking rationally
I'm thinking way too emotionally in this
case well who's going to come out as a
winner him not me
so for sizing into different patterns
you had to practice for yourself it's
something not very different for
different people now let's say you have
a $10,000 account some people are
comfortable as in 3,000 some people are
comfortable setting a thousand and some
people are willing to risk $300 some
people are willing to risk $100 so
emotional limits is something you have
to go test by yourself to really
practice how to be comfortable in each
pattern now personally for me at
practice the town at the beginning I
practiced at least 10 to 20 times per
size so I don't change my size until I
practice about 20 times and slowly
increase about 2 to 3 percent each time
when I trying to grow my position that
will be my final suggestions for testing
your own emotional limits hopefully this
video is helpful
those are my from the heart how to
become a better trader so that'll be all
the tips for this video thank you very
much for watching I will see you guys in
the next one

what's up guys Tim doctor
so today we're going to cover two topics
first will be what's the most efficient
way to get into date earnings and second
we're going to go over the weekly recap
what you have wrought acres recently so
I'm going to go over them one by one and
it's going to be very interesting
because the markets been fairly stable
compared to the last mount first of all
what's the most efficient with giving
day trading so first of all we divide
them into three sectors first will be
pattern analysis second will be by
analysis third will be indicating
answers now all those theories are kind
of related because they kind of included
each other so I'm going to list you know
how they are different pattern is
combined by criterias there's a criteria
1 or tier 2 and tier 3 for example so if
you are doing obviously a gap down or
potential first right they sure and you
are looking for market cap between they
say 10 to 100 million volume is around
20 million to 40 million the flow is
between about 3 to 5 million so you are
looking for all these specific criteria
for specific patterns once it fits the
criteria then you're looking at your
statistic sheets you should know what's
the winning percentage of this pattern
now second what I'm talk about will be
volume analysis this one is kind of
everywhere and I'm going to give
examples later on but it includes
gaining equalities and losing equalities
for example let's say we are trading on
the first green day and we have a
morning spike now more respect typically
counts as a guarantee quality so if the
stock continued to spike and starts
consolidation and there's no resistance
whatsoever people are very interesting
to this stock because if the stock is
already over a hundred percent and
people were saying oh you maybe go 200
percent during a percentage so in
between that time it will attract more
volume compared to normal so once you're
doing your long prediction for the
entire day if the stock is doing morning
spike consolidations you will trade more
bonds than normal now second when you
are looking at the same
panic and the stock just dropped 50% in
two seconds and that would definitely
you know people will lose interest about
their stock because will consistently
reduce volumes throughout the entire day
now that's gained equally and losing
equality so the last thing that it's
kind of related will be volume ratio
compared to individual resistance I'm
not going to dive too deep about that it
takes way too long to explain but volume
Narcis is very important to compare to
the factors and pattern definitely state
as a priority so when you're keen of
analysis and patterns patterns always be
volume analysis and the last one I'll
talk about will be factors I think it's
definitely the wrong way to approach
into the stock market when you are
learning double top double bottom and
these type of factors doesn't really
produce good winning percentage let me
give you an example so if there is a
massive support at three all right it's
unbreakable support we have a certainly
a double top by three point one all of a
sudden we can start dips to three you
would definitely reverse so there's no
reward for you maybe potentially ten
cents but stock definitely have much
bigger upside compare to the short side
so in this case people who are more
experienced with the stock market will
take advantage of that people that don't
really know how support and resistance
work how long notices and pattern works
and that's how they take losses so when
you are looking at factors they
definitely help but always pay attention
to the previous two priority will be
pattern drawing analysis and that's my
recommendations for you guys as a
beginner if you wanna learn and proach
into this market always find a one or
two repeatable patterns and how to
really find patterns already the video
before and that will be all suggestions
for beginner trying to get into the
market and let's get into weekly caps as
I said markets getting stable now so we
have d similar tickers and decent amount
of patterns and the pattern has gone
back to normal and it's very profitable
I have profit about close to maybe
30,000 to 40,000 this week it's going to
these ticker
and talk about how they're really spot
patterns and how do I really look at
which ticker is credible which ticker is
not it's getting to this two weeks recap
we have four takers that I selected
maybe I'm missing something but it's
getting to some of the tickers that I
wanted to talk about so wll this ticker
as a priority when we're looking at a
chart we look at the histories overall
we traded about 10 million shares or
more averaged about five minutes per day
and it's a consistently down trend chart
and we are looking at are consistent
uncertain chart with a major first
screen date it 60 percent of the time
you'll always have a second green day so
we were saying I take her perform the
first screen date actually the more
volume compared to in average and there
is about sixty percent of time the stock
will gap up and of course it gapped up
almost doubled and created a mass amount
of volume close to 300 million on that
one day now we are seeing a massive
amount of volume is what definitely not
normal because when we're looking at
general market the average voluntary
it's about 20 million to 40 million the
average so 300 million is definitely
overwhelming and of course the price is
a little bit lower compared to what we
trade in normal the price range we trade
is around three to ten dollars per share
around first green day now if it's a
multi-day runners it will be completely
different story
so um wll I consolidated close to three
hours and at the market close in the
next day it gapped down so he performed
the overstaying gap down definitely
trade much less volume compared to the
300 meeting day so when you're looking
at is two days trying to compare with
each other because the breakouts needs
consistent equities and potentially more
liquidity and the reason why I talk
about equality means the stock next day
needs to get more volume to break the
previous day high so we are looking at
wll 90 million difference not going to
break 300 million and in this case the
stock definite favors short now when it
favors sure you have to look at
and the flow and the resistance now as
we see the resistance is around 1.8 when
we're trading on NASDAQ stocks or my I
see Nasdaq does have a requirement that
the stock cannot go below 1 and if it
goes below wine doesn't really meet and
has that requirement so a lot of
companies tends to higher market makers
and potentially manipulative stock go
above 1 which is very normal in this
type of situation
so for wll you can automatically assume
the support is going to be out 1 and
where you want to show there will be
probably under 180 in this case and we
are shooting around let's say 140 and
your maximum reward will be 1 that's
only about 40 cents reward for me it's
definitely not worth it because when you
are trying to borrow shares to show this
type of stock as very cheap stocks so
you need more shares and that will give
you more Commission's as a cost and also
it will be more risk lower priced are
typically have much bigger risk the load
the prices the more risk you are having
and it's not very good risk reward and
also I'm trying to short with a large
amount of risk that's why I didn't
really short wll right people are asking
me about it and potentially you can
faith more and back to maybe 70 cents to
50 cents on long run but for me
definitely not my pattern and it's a
potential short so what's a try but
let's look at WRX now this one will be
one of the special ticker that we have
during the coronavirus hype stock went
from almost from 2 to 15 now 2 to 15 is
generally kind of normal when we're in
this type of market but the volume is
definitely not normal because in that
specific day we traded almost a hundred
million Mali on that day 100 million
long as I said it's around the maximum
volume that we typically have for these
type of low priced stocks so when you
are trying to aim for either over stink
gap down or potential back shore you
will be deafening good for long-term
hold as a
in my room and WRX I will hold on to its
around four or two and this one got
qualitative so probably when it reopens
its going to open around maybe even
under two or one because there tend to
do a massive offering and that's what
WRX and if you swing dit congrats and
swing positions typically involves about
two to three month hold and in this case
if you're sure that using obscene gap
down and adding the potential bounces
your average supposed to be around maybe
nine to ten and if you cover around two
dollars and that'll be over 80% profits
of your original investment so I will
say WRX are one of the signature
patterns for you to really learn from if
you're going to do part time traders so
the next one I'll talk about will be say
PAH and this ticker does have some type
of resistance now resistance it's not
that clear because when we're looking at
fresh resistance or clean resistance it
needs to be volume only packed in one
day not slow grind or potential breakout
through the resistance without any
volume so when I'm looking at in the
middle right here these type of in a
potential break out and on the figure
out kind of mess with the resistance a
little bit because it treated pretty
much no volume and thus I can break this
resistance in about five days so when
you're surely in say PAH this one I
didn't size the name the way I wanted
because as I said the resistance are a
little bit strange looking at overall
chart so this is the ticker that I
shorted average is around 3.8 and I
think it covered around 280 H so I
covered have around three covered have
around 270 Laster I won't talk about
will be Co DX now co DX is a very normal
chart that I talked about a thousand
times these type which are are favored
into swing positions that means when you
are trying to treat as an intraday
pattern it doesn't really work that well
because when star takes multiple days to
go up the speed of coming down equals
the speed of going up now let me give
you a
see example for motive owners compared
to fast countdowns and fast go up so I
know as you as you see I know I don't
know as you see the stop starts to speed
up day by day and treating more volume
compared to the previous day the second
round actually took much longer compared
to the first time first time went from
$4 to $20 in about one two three four
five days the fifth days actually
dropping so one two three four days and
I don't know starting from 8 to 15 so
overall only a hundred percent it took 1
2 3 4 5 6 days when compared to the
speed of going up for 220 that's about
500% 8 to 15 that's only about 100
percent i took longer to get up there so
for i know to come down you will take
probably four days or five days to go
back to maybe ten since there's a large
amount of support around nine and that's
why i'm always not ideal short so
hopefully not answered all your
questions on i know and see what the
eggs because i do see a lot of questions
that what the stocks going into
potential resistance what do i do again
about that is they intruded pattern or a
swing pattern so as I said it's a swing
pattern if you want to swing and you
will be worth your time but personally I
like to catch intraday patterns they do
have better risk reward and higher money
percentages so these type of swing
patterns they are slow I don't like slow
stocks so that's just my personal
opinion and that will be the end of the
video hopefully you guys liked it please

have any questions please leave a

what's up guys Stephen Baxter I'm
finally back so it was great to meet you
guys at the conference I think
conference went well and we also feel
alive shared making $20,000 on Monday
and I'm very grateful to meet all of you
guys so thank you for all you guys
support in this video I'm gonna give a
little bit of tips about how to really
trade a macro float since we had about
pretty much over 10 micro flow for last
couple weeks and we can talk about how
to really treat them and how to really
use a different method that into bounce
Shore or bridge higher levels and how to
be by breakouts so first of all let's
talk about arci and this is one of the
patterns that was a little bit strange
since the last couple days at the first
ending and it did a huge spike around
three point five to seven then a lot of
people are looking at is surely into it
because they see this huge conservation
crack but first of all when you see this
the stock is doing consolidating and
tented crack one two three four five
times in a row this is the situation I
shouldn't be showing in tune and as soon
as you shoot into a crack the stock
dealer reverse it save you sure into
this bounce and reversed into six point
three this is where you should cover
because typically when low flow cracks
it doesn't really have that much
strength to come all the way back and to
reach spike again they are see I along
the most rapid stocks into the
consolidation in the future for
September October November the mark is
going to get really really hot I
wouldn't really recommend shorting into
this type of microphone first screen day
so please be extremely careful there's a
lot of manipulations and you can take a
look of AR say what happened next day
this is where the destructions happen
for alarms so when when people say oh
using Emerson gap down first using
obviously a gap down you need the
minimum ow minimum while needs to be a
100k candle at least so if you take a
look at the Kenya at the beginning the
candle is only 50 K NK 40 K that's not
really sufficient to really use every
single day so of course it will cause a
squeeze and when the stock is oui
take a look at the volume it's taking
really little violent spiking from 6 to
9 100k that's extremely extremely low so
that means the query is a really low
seconds our low flow Isis are into the
panic and spiking percentage will be
amplified than normal tickers since our
SS are third there's gonna be a huge
spread and if you want to enter in the
pre-k level let's say you want entry at
$7 your execution will be actually 7.5
so you already missed about $0.50 at the
beginning when you exit you gonna exit
50 cents less that's how you really miss
$1.00 when you're training to your low
flow now as soon as the start decides to
down because people are mad opinion this
one so first you cannot get out sound
hot every pretty much every two seconds
second super low declaring you can end
up taking on us third you don't know
where it's going to dip low flow down
since the fundament is so bad it's
really difficult to find a dip in air
support if you try to do pie as six you
will likely end up pretty bad and
selling that four or five below so this
is the reason why I don't really trade
microprobe there's only couple of ways
to trade micro flow on a short side and
go on the long side not recommended
because volume too low you need
sufficient mine first before you go on
always pay attention to the volume so
let's talk about ffh oh this is the same
thing until a breakout and dumped all
the way back
now this one's pretty much not really
treatable on the short or the long side
first ocular dip huge trap trapped a
bunch of short sellers and just as gap
have in the second day now you can't
really short at 7 because there's so
much support underneath so you kind of
just watch the stock to be dead and
the consolidate for copy this and
finally decides to crack that five so
when this ticker does a bump short you
will become I'll put in your short using
five to six dollar area but other than
that first creams are not really
treatable too much volume you can treat
as a gap up short to try the test day in
the morning but you're likely to take a
loss then after that it's not real
treatable so either one short alongside
because on this type of but not dump
it's really easy to shake the buyer out
very very easy each candle dumps about
one dollar you can take a look five
point three to four point four so one
dollar five point four to four point six
so almost $1 again so microphone
extremely dangerous
not recommended always stay away from
these if you are not a very experienced
either you are going long or short
always pay attention to the volume if
you want to go long it has to be
sufficient volume needs to be crowded
anywhere between twenty meaning or above
so Arkady a this is also one of the very
interesting chart the stock did a
multi-day break young with very thin
volume you can take a look initial
volumes traded about fifty million 40
million and it's break evolving and
treated a pastor Tony minion since
there's not many people trading as taker
and the star tends to fade day by day
and this ten dollar level first there's
no consolidation second there's no
volume so shortening or go long very
unpredictable one at the point I really
want to emphasize is there is going to
be so many trades
putting your trades in the next code
month and there's gonna be trades I
can't really place any type of trades
but you can see the stock is going 200
percent two hundred percent forty
percent and that will give you so much
fun and you can see people on Twitter
social media that say oh I made about
2,000 4,000
it doesn't really matter what the money
is and you will give you a lot of FOMO
it means a fear of missing out so when
you have that emotion your mindset and
you're tempted to go into your market
you were likely to lose it's because you
see people making money and you're
looking at the ticker that you cannot
really place any type of long or short
trades and you're still trading it and
at that point you don't really know what
pattern are trading this is one of the
major issues of with all traders or
beginners they cannot control their
emotion you cannot control that hand you
are going to the market with a purpose
you're going to the market with a
certain percentage that's how you can
become consistent profitable so this is
the one of the three examples that one
give out and to tell people that if
there's no pattern no trade in the
volume doesn't really matter how much
it's going out doesn't matter how much
going down you can now predict in that
type of trouble cannot predict that
about push so always track your
statistics know your statistics know
your odds before going to any type of
tickers and hopefully the market start
getting hot after August that bit in the
video thank you very much and you guys
have a great day

================================================

welcome to this YouTube video in this
video we're gonna major the cover of the
tickers that happened this week so I
select a few takers cboi I made 120k on
that then mran and evk I think I made
small trades on those two tickers so
overall for this week I think I made
anywhere between 200 000 to 300 000 I'm
going to go over majority of my profits
and where it came from and how did I
really trade it in the morning so before
I start this video make sure to click
the like button and subscribe we have a
conference coming up in November 14th to
16th online if you want to find the
register link it's right below the video
so make sure to click that button and
you will be attending the conference for
the whole two days let's get into this
video The Golden Rule of the market is
if 90 of people are linked to one side
and 10 people will likely to profit from
the 90 and that corresponds to the rules
that 90 of the Traders lose my running
almost all the time so when you are
putting that psychology into the real
Market you can kind of see how people
react in terms of Spike and fail and I
found three examples and to show you how
it's really played out in the chart and
let's get into the chart so the first
ticker I want to talk about is cbli this
sticker if you look at the Historical
chart you have tons of resistance pretty
much everywhere you have one in July one
in June then tons of resistance in the
early 2020 so January and February and
when you see this much resistance and
the stock is trading tons of volume and
that also means the shares are rotating
the seller to the buyer so what does
that even mean people who bought earlier
like CBO I ticker they want to hold it
forever to make sure that if the stock
ever come back again they were likely to
you know even up their positions or
maybe potentially make a game and that's
why you see a tons of selling power
after market open for this candle I
don't want to mention who actually
pumped it but this was a chat room pump
it made the stock expected
um almost a 1.5 dollar but you see as
soon as the breakout happens you did a
huge figure on everybody so people went
long are all underwater when they bought
at the breakdown so in this case when
the historical buyers are setting into
the new buyers and majority people are
buying the breakout which they become
the 90 of people holding the float and
the golden rule about the market is 90
of the people if they are leaning to one
direction ten percent people were likely
to profit in this case that's why cboi
dropped massively did a huge freak out
on everybody on the breakout especially
for the buyers that's how you went from
5.4 to 3.2 faded all day and this is the
ticker that I shorted it around 4.88 and
I think I added a little bit on the
spike right here so overall I didn't
really top ticket because it was a chat
manipulations but overall direction will
not change based on the chat pump always
remember that if the volume is
sufficient then you don't have to worry
about any type of chat pumps if it's
liquid enough then always focus on the
chart instead of think about the stock
is manipulated that it's affecting your
decision making so the second chart I
want to talk about will be mran
this ticker had a very similar
pre-market action and this is I want to
also talk about as well because both on
MRA and and evk if you see the
historical chart there is zero
resistance whatsoever and evk as well
you can see fresh char No resistance no
volume until October 22nd same thing
with mran this is on October 21st and
the real action in the morning
completely changed MRN failed in the
morning and came back and Consolidated
around 4.8 then dropped by the close
ebk this taker actually expected through
pre-market resistance you can see
started around three expected to five
and most of the takers tends to test the
pre-market consolidation will fail but
in this case when so many people are
used to that type of action when so many
people are shorting 90 people are
showing then 10 people were likely to
make a game so that would be the main
idea of how to really adapt into the
market because if you don't have a
certain pattern that consistent produce
enough winning percentage and also give
you a decent reward a lot of people tend
to put this type of ticker as a
definition of adapting to the current
market but that's not how it goes most
of the takers tends to change if there
is no statistics behind it for the last
five to seven examples that pre-market
Gunners after market open they tends to
spike into the resistance then drop it
happened about six to seven times said
people are getting used to it they think
okay this is me try to adapt into the
current market if they try to size in
too much if it tends to repeat way too
many times the stock will likely to
reverse something easily so especially
for beginners you need about 100 samples
and the long consistent winning
percentage for you to really get into
this type of pattern and make sure it
come out with a win for something like
mran and evk if you see this type of
pattern happens about six to seven times
and you think it's a pattern but you
don't really have a large sample to back
it up to consistent generating enough
winning percentage for you or enough
reward for you then you will be not
ideal for you to try to go really big
after you see the sixth or seven time
testing pre-market resistance and try to
short into the pre-market resistance so
the second point I want to make is in
the last week we have about 10 plays in
total maybe 10 to 15 plays and we've
been getting around 15 to 20 million
volume on trading in the pre-market the
majority of them tends to spike as soon
as it produces a failed morning Spike as
a short Setter also as a buyer don't be
too rushed trying to get into the open
candle because there's tons of volume
come after it being patient is number
one criteria for you to become a
consistent profitable Trader make sure
to wait 15 minutes after market open
then make your decision based on what
pattern you are trading to identify if
the stock has enough resistance to block
the volume from keep going up and that
will be the key component to win in this
market so that will be of the tickers I
want to cover today thank you very much
for watching and I will see you guys in
the next one

================================================

mr. past even doctor will come to the
new week video lessons and today we're
gonna talk about some of the tickers
just overall in March we had a bunch of
runners either leading with the pattern
performance or they're running on really
thin volume and we got biotechs hype and
loafer types me seems like there's a lot
of actions but it doesn't really have
that really good out pattern existing
down overall March let's get started
so hunt this is another one of the
tickers that I ran from I think $10 to
almost hundred and three and this one
was running a really really thin volume
as you can see the volume was around 160
K and our bond was on 700 K the entire
day now let me give you idea of how much
on should it be trade throughout the
entire day so typically on penny stocks
the minimum volume on current date
should be for meeting at least for me or
you cannot place any kind of trade in
there either the spread is gonna be huge
or you're not gonna get a really good
execution price second as soon as you
get in there's no recording so if
there's no trickery and then gonna be
stocking that's the two things it's
really really dangerous to get into
those lowly quality stocks that it seems
very very manipulated if the stock is
trading around 200 caricature there's
definitely can be one individual just
buy the entire flow and want it plate
the stock to 100 200 there's nothing you
can do the volume has to be around that
these four million maximum is around 40
million so over 40 million the stock's
considered to get really crowded if that
stock is crowded it's gonna be really
difficult to trade throughout the entire
day if it seems to manipulate like this
it's really really easy for SEC to hold
those kind of stocks if you are stuck
and $90 per share then you're pretty
screwed because as soon as they opened
you're gonna go to your right really
started probably at $10
don't brining chasing into load equity
stocks
minimum air volume four million I was
hoping how can
bring a bunch of sympathy plays it turns
out didn't a bar a bunch of really
really low flow stocks I'm try that you
took hand see owt you had GPR so those
two tickers are really low flow I'm
convinced this shows COF WTO's around
800 K flow IG b ran our stock around 800
K flow I think G barrels will be higher
around 2 or 1 million fro I remember
back in July stock was super manipulated
by sure trader even from yeah went from
4 to 12 and dumped from 13 but I went
from 13 to 4 in one day and you had
couple Punk shoulders back back then
I tend to stay away from any floor under
2 million even though it's good pattern
where it's about short sometimes just
can get a pattern like this it fades on
the first day second day of super green
can't recall the breakout when the
volume was increasing Friday volume last
made it seems like going to break the
previous resistance volume which is
around 10 million 10 million doesn't
consider as a really heavy resistance
that's why I didn't show into it but
turns out fit it sometimes you get those
opportunities that you think you can go
in and make money but you overall you
won't make money in your long run so
it's really good to practice the
discipline don't trade the stock if it
doesn't meet the criteria if the
resistance is not heavy and it's also on
low flow so i basically skipped
GBR same thing with city of WT and this
one was an rj q 1 i'm typically normal
tickers if the stock gaps up and falls
back about 50% Frank's entire again
until it doesn't come back now this one
came back same thing low flow loafer
can't do anything so if the stock is
getting up on really really low flow
under two minutes
don't ever underestimate the potential
of coming back people who are shown into
this bounds got completely squeezed now
look at the squeeze the volume right
here squeeze one time Quijote
that's about 200k squeeze an hour Hotel
400k 400k is squeezed about almost I
would say each candles are on 15% on
that really using volume and squeezed up
far on the price that's the risk of
shorting into low flow triggers no
matter where you shorted I don't care I
don't care insurance' owt or GVR you may
make money but your round round loaf
logo always come back to get you never
show the weakness no floaters if you buy
just be super careful see owt
if you go wrong I think that's ideal
because it straight is amount of volume
if you look at see owt about 16 minimum
intraday if you buy haunt well those are
two very very different things because
if the stock is on really low liquidity
you buy it you always lose if the stock
is volume you buy it sometimes you want
just be really careful which one which
low flow you're not buying to you for me
personally I major in shorting so I'm
not really comfortable to go along super
low flow because I hate gay intraday
hotel especially on something I can't I
think have seen one before the stock was
trading decent model volumes or it was
at first Green Day trading on a regular
volume I think was up around four
hundred percent or something like that
stock goes around sixty cents in squeeze
to one dollar and that was wrong around
65 I was up around 15,000 and the stock
Kohoutek when they opened opened at
forty something cents so I was instant
down 20% so that's a unfortunately also
you get stuck into those trades um
really low flow sketchy penny stocks I
always suggest to go along really small
don't ever try to go for positions on
those special honors Long's yeah into
the hotel pretty much school instant
down 20% now we'll see about huh once
they opens you will probably open around
20 dollars to ten dollars so that's the
tape backing you up today hopefully you
guys have a great March thank you very
much for watching this video and I will
see you guys next

Oh
but some cast even doctor welcome to my
new video lessons of the week and today
we're gonna talk about the recent plays
and the markets being really really
boring anyway we're gonna talk about oxp
are and there's why S&amp;W MLP so recently
there's a lot of micro flow spiking and
they're going gap ups or kept up Shore
and I personally don't like shooting
anything flow under 2 million because it
can be really easy manipulated and just
like MTS LGB are and a double X so
people just buy the entire flow letter
make a short squeeze each other and
that's why I start off run to the 236
and people came marching call people
blow up their account so those place
with micro flow please be careful
because there's only couple entries you
can may take a try and to be potential
profit in this specific ticker but if
you are chasing witness who are chasing
strength you can be really really heavy
d stop and get dumped on okay a massive
short squeeze so please be careful
shooting those micro low flow stocks
they tend to be really really dangerous
so lxp are not not much volume and
attempted to shore but I didn't try it
because the recent general markets
around 2013 medium share trade per day
on those penny stock tickers and in the
morning typically trades about 4 to 5
million shares in the first two to three
hours so expre doesn't trade on much
volume the highest volume can of about
100,000 and it's not enough you take
decent positions and it can be really
really easy to speculate a bit more or
just dump straight off the gauge so the
first thing you want to focus on is the
volume to decide either you're going to
go long or short so if you see on micro
low flow starts it started going crowded
and it favors more than short because a
lot of people cannot go short and then
nickel on if you think there's only
specific amount of supply and 90% people
are going along and the flow is rotating
so
time is going to be people that keeps
holding the stock for a while that's why
rotating it's really benefit to the long
side instead of short side especially on
a first green day now um not only sys
and get a perfect over sting gap down
but the thing is with go boosting gap
time you need a volume block if you
don't have a bottom bracket gaps down
sometimes you don't have enough good
odds to be favored on the short side but
yes I guess there's no I'm sure it's too
short so nobody came really sure and
that's why a massive sell-off on open
and one bacterial count from at the $4
so wlp it's Kearney halted news pending
and it's a gap up short and I'm pretty
sure most people already took their
profits around in 2.75 or $3 H because
they only almost dropped a 100 percent
skin.i pretty sure any penny stocks most
of the pinion style you can have halted
for a while because nobody likes the
whole painting style that are halted
most likely going to be a sell-off but
there's going to be that one person of a
chance of paint start going massive
spikes so that's why you don't ever want
to get caught in a hole sometimes if you
got caught in a hole and unfortunate but
if you are going short and the stock
gets t12 then you're most likely benefit
on the short side that's just a general
statistics of how hot to be behaving for
past two years of what I noticed now the
next thing is lots of people are asking
me about the private teaching our

================================================

Language: en
hello guys steven dexter welcome to this
video and today we are going to cover
some very interesting concepts about
supply and demand
and how to really use them in real time
especially
when you are lab trading and be able to
recognize
the potential trend is changing or there
is potential danger
if you are taking a short position in
the afternoon we have a virtual
conference coming up in november 14th to
16th
and i think will be a very interesting
experience for you guys to join
especially for beginners and some people
who already traded about one or two
years
personally me and temper tony both of us
made
the most money compared to the entire
career we've been trading
in this industry so not only are going
to learn some new patterns and also
to be able to know how to really adapt
to the market next time
we get this type of insane action so
before i start this video make sure to
click the like button and subscribe
[Music]
before you are looking at a stock you
want to look at in terms of supply
demand to be able to apply that into a
stock you are looking at the float which
will be the supply
and the potential volume is going to
trade through the entire day
that will be the demand so a lot of
people
are very confused about flow rotations
and start getting crowded
and if you can use this formula you will
be
very good to recognize that there is a
potential crowded stock is going to
happen today
for example let's say the stock flow is
around
50 million and the stock volume today
can potentially trade up to
100 million maybe 50 million so you're
using the potential volume it's going to
trade through the entire day divided by
the flow that will
make sure to give you a number to
identify if the stock is going to be
crowded or not
normally if the stock rotates about five
times or more it's considered very
crowded
ten times or more very crowded 15 times
or more then it becomes not tradable
if the flow is about 50 million and the
volume is 50 million
then the flow is going to rotate about
one time that will be the only reason
you see that their volume is there but
the flow is way too big then the stock
is going about anywhere between 10 to 20
range not having tons of volatility
not jumping 20 in one candle and that is
the reason
to make a judgment to make sure if the
stock is going to be crowded or not
you want to use the potential estimated
volume divided by the entire flow
if the result is over 5 then it's going
to be very crowded
let's take a look at htz flow is around
100 million
and the pre-market volume traded around
100 million in the pre-market so the
entire
buying estimate for the entire day will
be close to 1 billion
1 billion divided by 100 million which
the flow is going to rotate
10 times today potentially and which
exceeds number five so the stock is
going to get really crowded
now how to really identify the potential
action and how it's going to perform
throughout the entire day
based on the trend this is when you are
going to look at the historical chart so
going back
to one year to two years you can see
that recently the stock had
tons of resistance packing around three
to five
and the stock basically gapped up really
close to three dollar
that's one of the reason a lot of people
are selling as soon as the stock opens
so when you see 100 200 million
resistance that will create a bunch of
selling pressure
as soon as the market open that's one of
the reason why
htc dropped from almost three dollars to
1.5
that's where we're looking at the base
volume so
htz expected from one to three remember
what i said about stocks under three
it's really difficult to trade
this is the chart that made a lot of
people to lost money on
especially their shortly in the
afternoon on the bounce which i
personally did
and i didn't really like the price
action i only showed it a very tiny
amount
only took a very small loss due to the
volatility of the stock a lot of people
are sizing in hundreds and millions of
shares
and that's how they take a loss on these
type of
small price stocks so let's look at the
mentality and how
buyers and sellers really exchange
shares with each other
so normally what i mentioned about the
more expensive the stock price is
and the more volume it gets it's very
likely for the stock to drop in that
specific day
is because there's no more money can be
traded
let's say there's total about 100
million
dollar can be traded in this industry
and
100 million is already used in that day
there's no more money can be poured into
for potential buy the stock even higher
and that will cause the death drop
on the intraday now for one dollar stock
which
stock is going to take a while to meet
that maximum
dollar amount that's why the stocking
gets tons of volume
and also when the stock is really cheap
a lot of retailers can buy a tons of
shares
if the stock is around 10 a share then
that will be very difficult for them to
buy
ten thousand shares or one million
shares when the stock is one
dollar or a couple cents they can buy
ten thousand shares twenty thousand
shares no problem
so that will be one of the main reasons
that stocks under three
is really easy to hold its dips and
also can potentially produce a massive
squeeze after
the initial drop and htz did an initial
drop because of the back holders that
comes from a couple months ago and the
volume
actually picked the stock up because the
stock is really cheap
and also people are tend to hold more
shares due to the stock price
one of the major reasons i want to make
is if you are showing a stock that is
under three
then i would recommend that if the
fading percentage is 50
to 75 percent i would always cover
partial my positions especially on the
drop and
for a stock that is over than three and
you will take them
a long time to fade and also much safer
to fade
if it's trading tons of volume if the
volume is way out of control
and the stock is also really cheap that
is one of the signal to tell you that
make sure to cover early
and also do not try to hold the stock
for too long because
the more of the volume can be traded
that means the more competitive the
stock will be
and also it's going to become very
unpredictable
so that will be one of the method to
really predict the stock is going to be
crowded and also to save yourself from
these type of massive squeeze
so that will be end of this video if you
have any questions please leave a
comment below
make sure to grab the conference ticket
i will see you guys next time

hello guys steven dexter welcome to this
youtube videos today we're going to talk
about some of the takers that happened
for the last two weeks asag and sndo
really stood out
and i'm going to talk about some of
their charting behaviors
and some of the factors you should pay
attention to especially during the
midday
so before i start this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
i really appreciate that and let's get
into the video
so let's start with on this sticker i
think i lost about 50 000
and let's start from the beginning uh so
this taker went from one to five i think
it was
without any news was pumping the ticker
it would just pure volume
and hype i'll drive the stock from three
to five
you can see that the stock was really
struggling around the five dollars
550 area so i decided that took a
position around
close to five risking the 560.
i wasn't very aware of my risk of how
much i'm going to
lost after i cover around the 570.
so um i sized in a little bit too much
around the consolidation area because it
failed it twice
tried to test the high high of the day
so 550 right here uh failed it to test
it out
right about here around 10 45 then fail
to test it out
around 11 56 but you can kind of see
that each time when the stock trying to
break it down of its own support
it held consistently for
almost 10 times so we have one right
here
one right here one two
three four and five so
once it gets into the midday the stock
still holding
about ninety percent of its own gain so
i didn't really take my profit
i waited and the stock decided came back
and did the midday perk pattern
uh once it breaks the 560 area
and it basically went from 5 to 20. so
normally for this type of behavior it
doesn't
really happen that often because for a
flow
that is around 30 million and the normal
squeezing percentage for this type of
flow is around 50
to 60 percent so i wasn't really aware
of okay so if asag decided to
uh do a fake out and how far it will
pull because 90
of the time you will never hold its
afternoon spike
so for uh this scenario i caught my
losses
around six dollar area so i took about
20 something percent losses
overall it wasn't a very good trade and
also i didn't really
stick to my rule because the volume was
way too much
and also there were little
resistance around four so that wasn't
that much compared to the intraday
volume
and the last one assessing way too much
so
make sure in the future wise if the
volume is really overwhelming compared
to the historical resistance you have to
treat it like a fresh chart there was
nothing in the historical chart
there's only one intro entry chart for
you to analyze so the second ticker i
want to talk about is
sndl uh this is very
similar to bngl which i took last i
think it was early
this year uh in january let's
see what's the difference between b and
g o and s and d
l so after i took a loss on b and g o
i found out pretty much all of the multi
developers doesn't really drop
75 percent after the initial first red
day so you can see that sndo only
dropped roughly
around 50 percent um let's say
start spiking around 50 cents to four
then dropped it to two so that's about
50 percent from the high
now let's look at bngo you can see
after the initial run up stock went from
one dollar to seven so it dropped it to
3.7
at one point um so for both of the
tickers
i did learn something that i should
cover earlier if i decided to short into
multi-day runners
so for sn dl my initial heavy size is
around 3.4
covered around 50 percent at 2
12-ish added again
at 292.80 then the final cover
will be 1.8 and 1.9 is
so for the entire trade i made over
around
180 000 for aacg lost about fifty
thousand
i think both of the tickers are
completely different patterns
asag i was appeared gap up short without
resistance
sn deal much safer bigger flow and it's
trading
massive amount of volume but if it's
really overextended
and it's about to go red when the stock
especially
going into the back side with really
heavy volume
ninety percent of the time you would
drop a little bit more into the next day
that's why i chose
to cover sndo at the next day at
open so that will be all for today's
recap make sure to stay safe
trading in the current market because
you have to stay really disciplined
to respect your risk avoid getting
squeezed from 5 to 20.
i heard people that didn't really cut
losses on aacg
and also make sure capitalize on these
very heavy volume multi-developers
i think it will be a really good
shorting opportunities once they decide
to go red
and potentially fade into the next day
so that'll be all thank you very much
for watching i will see you guys in the
next one

hello guys steven ducks here welcome to
this youtube video so today's video we
are going to cover how to really look at
a stock
in a simple way uh before i start this
video we have a conference coming up in
november 14th to 16th
so will be the next two weeks if you are
interested in this day trading industry
or you have been trading for
one or two years it's going to be a
really good experience for you guys to
come to hear
three of our traders share our
experience about
especially this year how to really adapt
into market and
we are going to review some of the new
patterns as well
so before i start this video make sure
hit that like button and subscribe
it's going to really help our youtube
channels so let's get into the main
content today
if you are a total beginner and you are
gathering information
from all of the sites like filmvis yahoo
finance to get a statistics
on the general stock you're interested
about and there's
all kinds of different statistics about
stock and there's only three things you
need to know
volume float and market caps
because those rings can directly affect
how you
place a trade on a certain ticker now
first let's talk about volume volume
generally
means how much demand is in the stock
currently
so let's say the stock traded about 100
million shares today
and that's considered a very good volume
or
almost very crowded and that indicates
the stock has a really good demand
secondly let's look at
float a lot of people are confused
between float and share outstanding
share outstanding means the total
outstanding shares
is in the stock and the float means the
total amount of shares you can trade by
investors like
you and other people wants to invest
into the stock they're not insiders
so flow is the most important thing you
want to look at share outstanding
doesn't really matter at all
in this case float means the supply
when you are trading a stock it's a very
simple supply and demand
question it's because if you can figure
out the demand is overwhelming the
supply then the stock price definitely
going to increase
so that's the relationship between
volume and flow
lastly let's talk about market cap and
volatility generally market cap can take
a big effect
on volatility itself so a lot of people
are confused about
market cap and volatility let's explain
them one by one
so market cap normally i split them into
three different sections
now it will be zero to 100 million
that's one section 100 to 500 million
that's the second section
500 to one billion that's the third
section now the fourth section which i
don't normally trade at all so i
kind of ignored it but the fourth
section will be one billion
or up and when you want to focus on the
day trading industry you normally want
to stay
in the three section between 0 to 1
billion
the second thing i want to talk about
will be volatility volatility means
how much range the stock can create in
that day
so normally you see a stock drops 70
from the highs in one day
and you see a stock just dropping maybe
two to three percent or move out one to
two percent in one day
so that's the reason why volatility can
create
large amount of profit and that's also
the main factor of
a lot of traders can make 50 000 or 100
in one day and that's they are taking
advantage from the volatility
so how does market cap and volatility
relate to each other
let me give you a solid example so first
of all
when you are looking at the entire day
trading industry it's almost
90 percent retail investors there is
a total amount of dollar can be traded
in one day
if you are really trying to focus in
this specific industry not into the
billion dollar cap
so if there is a total amount of dollar
can be only traded in one day
then we are putting this dollar amount
into a
bigger cap it's not going to affect the
bigger cap stocks
very much let's assume the total amount
of dollar can be traded in one day will
be one billion
then we put that one billion dollar in a
100 million dollar cap
you can make that stock go for a
thousand percent before it drops
now let's put them into a different
condition we put one billion dollar
into one billion dollar stock that can
only make the stock go
up 100 so the higher the market cap is
the harder it's going to make the stock
move based on how much money is being
traded in this industry
and let's try to pull off the factors
together we have demand
which will be the volume we have supply
which will be
the float we have market cap which
will indicate and tell you how much
volatility you can create in one day
so how do we use all those three factors
together
to generate a decent method to really
benefit your trading skill
so i'm going to explain one situation
you can use all three factors together
and just listen carefully if you
understand
make sure leave a comment below if you
have any questions also leave a comment
below
i will get back to you as soon as the
video is posted
so here we go normally that we see a
stock can go from one to five
first of all we can use the concept
that we know there's a total amount of
dollar can be traded in one day
so we place that in a stock let's say
the stock is
100 million it can go maximum a thousand
percent so we have that idea
of okay this is the maximum the stock
can spike to uh
one to ten dollars and of the student we
have a
massive consolidations at ten dollars
then how can we use
the volume which it will be the demand
and
the flow which will be the supply how do
we use those two factors
to predict where the stock is going to
drop so we know the maximum
that stock is going to trade 1 billion
dollar in that day spiking from 1 to 10
a thousand percent
when we have a massive consolidation
which will be a flat line
and it's trading tons of volume that
also means the share are exchanging
hands back and forth
so if i bought at one dollar i'm selling
that 10 and if you
bought a two dollar you're selling that
10 as well because the longer it
consolidates it actually makes buyers
nervous
as soon as the stock decides to crack or
even a little fifteen percent or five
percent move
nobody wants to be the last one to sell
because when you
are the first one sale you will get a
better execution
so if you bought at eight and as soon as
the stock pulls back
to two percent you are eager to sell so
the longer the consolidation
is that means all the barriers are
switching
from one to ten because the reason why
stock didn't drop
is because people are buying at 10. all
the shares are slowly exchanging hands
from all the prices
to the 10 mark now we know the golden
rule of the market is 90 percent of
people
are generally going along and also 90
percent of people
are generally losing in the market so
the more volume is trading that
consolidation
the more people are holding into that
consolidation and the more people are
buying
in that consolidation as well eventually
what turned out 90 percent of people are
holding the entire float
and that will cause a massive drop in
this case you are using all the three
factors together
you are using the demand which you are
using the volume to predict
where the stock is going to drop and
also you are using the supply
because the more volume you trades if
the flow is rotating 10 times 15 times
or more
that tells you most of people are
holding at the same level
thirdly market caps generally when you
are trading
under 100 million caps most of the
companies are generally
penny stocks and by using all those
three factors together you can kind of
predict where the stocks going to drop
and also predict the volatility as well
by using
all those three factors all right guys
that will be the end of this video the
last part is a little bit complicated
so if you have any questions please
leave a comment below thank you very
much for watching i will see you guys in
the next
[Music]

hello guys steven here welcome to this
youtube videos and today we're going to
cover
some of the basic method of how to
really value support
and i do see a lot of beginners making
the same mistakes over and over again
so in this video it's going to be very
helpful for beginners to actually
find the correct dip by strategies or
breakout strategies as well
on the second hand it's also going to
help you to find
the correct statistics you want to track
so before i start this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
let's get into the video
so the first method you have to nerf on
support is volume
and the support has to combine with each
other to form a solid ground
for you to dip by so in this case i will
actually give you an example
of dlpn that happened last week to give
you
an idea of how to really look for
support and also
some of the terms you learn from books
like 200-day moving average
or 52-week highs or view apps these type
of terms
they don't usually work as a support so
that's why a lot of people
tend to make the mistakes by using that
type of price point
as their support also as a risk level
that's why they tend to take
a lot of losses by using these terms so
let's look at dlpn
uh for the overall chart that the stock
never performed
a huge spike like last week and traded
160 million shares on the first screen
day so when you are looking at the first
screen day it's
a very bullish sign and also it's very
difficult to shorten to
that's why most of the short squeezes
happen on the first green day
now once we know that the momentum is
driven
upwards we want to find what's the
correct support for us to either dip buy
or to buy the breakouts or if you are
shorting
a ticker you want to know where you want
to cover normally you want to cover
right before the support
so in this case you can have to know the
boat side
either long and short to figure out uh
where is your target and also where is
the short service target as well
so for the charge dlpn you can see that
the stock
consolidated between 15 to 17
for almost the entire day and
when the stock tends to break out
through that 20
area in the after hour majority of the
people will use that support to buy
the breakouts and you can see that the
stock went from 19
to almost 40 dollars in the next day and
it tried to test the 40
again and it went back to the 19
20 support and it's cracking very very
slowly
ever since that day what we can get from
this chart is
first of all that first green day
normally is the uptrending momentum
when the stock tends to go red on the
day that stock is
tends to switch its momentum and going
back to the support
so in this case we have two different
mindsets
for long and short let's go over the
long side
as i said on the first point that volume
and support has to combine with each
other
to actually form a solid ground for you
to dip by so the more dense the volume
that trades in that specific
consolidation area the harder for the
support to crack
so in this case dlpn traded a hundred
million volume
and the consolidation is pretty tight
it's between 15 to 20 and once it breaks
out in after hour
that the stock tends to flip double of
its price
so for this specific case
as i mentioned in the previous couple
videos that the smaller the market cap
is
the higher the stock tends to go dlpn
that has around 100 million market cap
that's considered to be a very small
market cap
so the potential of the stock going
higher is
greater than gamestop gme
so the first thing you want to write
down will be that
the more volume that trades in the one
specific consolidation area
the more winning percentage you will
have by deep buying
from the support the second one you want
to write down is if the stock is on the
up trending momentum
especially after the first screen day
performs the breakout
and it tends to go parabolic in after
hour or into the second green day
you want to memorize that if the market
cap is really small from the beginning
then you have a greater potential
to get more reward from by did buying or
buying the breakout from the
consolidation area so the second point
on the cover will be dead buying
strategies from the support in this case
this is more about buying from the
support
after the stock tends to lose its
massive momentum
from the day high to the major support
more of gme which i talked about
previous couple of videos
and that's a great opportunity did
buying from a hundred dollar area
for dlpn you can use that as well so the
faster
the drop is the more likely that stock
tends to bounce from the major support
so let's try to use that method on dlpn
so
you can see that uh the stock went from
uh 40 to 19 in one day you can see that
the action
of the chart is pretty slow that is
slowly faded
all the way back from 40 dollars to 19
but for gme it dropped 300
within an hour so that's not the normal
action you get
that as i said that the faster the drop
is the more likely the stock tends to
bounce
so if the opn that performs the action
went from 40 dollars to 19 in about 30
minutes or an hour
this is the chance that you can dip by
because you can see
even the stock tends to fade all day
it's still difficult for the stock tends
to fade more
after it hits the major support level so
you can see that once they hit the
support
it's bouncing a little bit and it's also
fading about maybe two percent three
percent on each day and sometimes it
tends to go up again
so overall that two method you can learn
first of all is the support has to
consolidate with a lot of volume
the second point is when the stock is on
the down trending momentum
you want to aim for the fast drop you
don't want to wait
for the entire day after the stock
already faded so those are the very two
basic methods you can learn from
deadline support and also try to value
the correct support so that'll be all
for this video uh leave a comment
or question below if you want me to
answer and
that will be the end of this video thank
you very much for watching i'll see you

hello guys team dexter welcome to this
youtube video and today i'm going to
talk about some of the adjustments that
i personally made
for multi-day runners especially in 2020
and first of all i want to thank you for
you guys that came to the conference
during this conference we caught a live
trade on athe hopefully you guys
made money by the end of the day
uh shortly very small at 3 20 up now 3
sorry uh planning to add it but
this is the opportunity you can take
[Music]
we definitely took some profits
partially and the conference ended there
so if you guys have any questions
about the sticker you guys can leave a
comment below and let's get into the
video
so for the multi-day pattern adjustments
i want to make in total of three points
first of all when you are looking at a
multi-day runner pattern you want to
look at the initial market cap
because if you start buying a billion
dollar cap it's not going to go that
high
it's not going to have the potential to
spike to 300
but if you are looking at a market cap
that is under 100 million initially
then you will have much better chance to
get much
better reward compared to buying
something like a billion dollar cap
so the second point i want to make will
be reference to the chart that we had on
cb 80
and solo those two charts have the
secondary breakout
now secondary breakout is completely
different story compared to the first
breakout
so we will talk about how secondary
breakout is not
as strong compared to the first one and
also what's the correlation between the
first
and the secondary breakout as well so
the third point i want to talk about
volume prediction which i
specifically taught in doxinator
and also training technique as well
volume prediction is very important
i'm going to introduce the concept
behind it and how to really spot the
breakout before the market even open
and you will have much better winning
percentage to trade in this
multi-day breakout pattern so today
we're going to talk about two tickers
c-b-a-t and s-o-l-o both of them
are very similar chart you can look at
the historical chart of two years
you have around 200 million support
between four to
five then you have 200 million support
around
six so on both of the chart you can see
that it looks
pretty much identical but there's one
thing that's completely different
is the initial market cap as i said the
higher the initial market cap is
the more difficult for stock to go up
whenever the stocks initial market cap
exceed over 500 million
it's not going to be very profitable
especially
on the way up so in terms of risk award
higher market cap generally have lower
risk
but especially when you are looking for
much bigger reward on multi-day breakout
smaller initial market cap works the
best
so in this case uh solo compared to cbat
you can kind of see that solo has much
lower market cap compared to
cbit so in terms of risk reward solo
actually have a much better reward now
if
we're not taking any type of criteria
solo actually have much better reward
compared to cbat
in this case cbit started with much
higher market cap
but in actual charge cba extended much
further
than s-o-l-o so in terms of
charting let's look at the specific
chart itself
well first of all let's start with c
b-a-t initially
stock went from point one to four and it
had
its first breakout break through this
or 200 million support and the first
extension is only about 20
and that's considered a completely fake
out
and the secondary breakout started
around
five you went all the way up to 11.
normally that
secondary breakout is correlated with
first breakout if the first breakout is
really strong then the secondary
breakout is going to be strong as well
in this case cb80 actually have much
stronger or strength compared to the
first one so
cbit is definitely our outlier just
according to
all of the statistics that have tracked
for multi-day rounder
second ticker we can look at is first
breakout for
solo started around 309
all the way to six now they consolidated
much longer than cbat
then the secondary breakout extended
only about twenty percent
so in terms of breakout level cbit is
definitely an outlier
and they extend it much longer and
further so let's look at
other criterias might fit in and
actually can explain
why cbit ran much further compared to
solo
so let's look at in terms of volume this
is the main criteria that we're going to
look for especially when we're looking
at a breakout
so the first day of the breakout
actually traded only
about 90 million volume now compared to
solo
first the breakout volume traded around
40 million so the more volume it can
trade
in one day then for the second day the
second day liquidity which
is volume has to surpass the first day
for cbit
that the second day did surpass the
first day
but it still traded around 100 million
but you can see
solo that traded 160 million so
to extend to the next day that solo
needs to trade more than
160 million shares on the next day which
is
very unlikely and on cbit well you only
traded
100 million shares so it's much lower
volume compared to solo
and that will bring more odds for
spiking a little bit further compared to
the solo ticker
so when you are looking at overall
multi-day breakout patterns the first
green day cannot have that much volume
because the more volume it has
then the next day liquidity or volume
it's going to be very difficult
for a stock to extend even more so let's
go over
all the three criteria first of all that
you want a really low initial market
caps so
the stock itself have much potential to
extend
now the second point you want to look at
is the
first breakout and secondary breakout
well normally you want to see
that there is a lot of extensions on
first
breakout so the secondary breakout can
be as
good as the first one because when you
are looking at in terms of the second
criteria
the psychology behind it is when
somebody wants to buy a breakout
that they want to see okay this actually
this ticker
had a decent history of breakout so in
the next breakout the ticker itself will
give them much more confidence
to hold longer and buy more shares on
the second breakout
so the third criteria will be volume and
liquidity make sure that the first
day on the breakout do not trade you
know the maximum volume can be traded in
a day
then the next day there will be no
liquidity can be traded on the next day
um so if it's trading decent amount of
volume somewhere like
40 million to 60 million it's very ideal
but if it trades over 200 300 million
it is pretty much impossible for the
next day to exceed
the previous day liquidity so that will
be overall three of the criteria you
want to look for
and some of the adjustments that i made
for 2020
and thank you very much for watching
this video and i will see you guys
next time

SOURCE VIDEO: The rules you MUST follow trading in 2021. Day Trading [nvQ2vuHu18A].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys steven ducks here welcome to
this youtube videos today we're going to
talk about some of the rules
i would like to take into 2020 because
i've noticed there is a dramatic change
from the market condition from 2018 2019
to 2021
so hopefully those sets of rules will
help you
to grow your account and also to be able
to avoid all those
huge mistakes that can potentially blow
up your account
so before i start this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
and let's get into the video so the
first rule i want to call
its name of volume density because
recently pretty much for 90 percent of
the gappers
their pre-market volume normally exceeds
20 million to 40 million ish now for the
normal volume
is under 20 million and extremely
crowded volume
is over 40 million so let me give you
like a rough estimate formula for that
type of pre-market volume
to estimate the entire day volume so
back in 2018 2019
we have around in average around 10
million to 20 million
that is considered as crowded trades now
crowded trades is over 40 million
but for the formula itself that
pre-market valentine's day to estimate
entirely volume
doesn't really work lately especially
that the volume
is so much that you can basically trade
in pre-market without actually
affecting the liquidity so the first
hard rule i want to say for myself
will be if the pre-market bond is under
10 million
in the market condition of 2021 that's
basically not tradable because there's
way too much
volume potential can pour into the stock
to make the stock jump
200 300 percent and nobody can expect
that
now the second rule is if the volume
stays between 10 million to 20 million
that's considered to be like a normal
stock that can be
traded with maximum volume but not as
crowded
that's basically untreatable for the
pre-market volume exceed over 40 million
then that's type of indicator to tell
you that do not trade
aftermarket open because it's impossible
to predict if it's gonna pull 20 percent
or
spike another 50 percent so if you want
to trade
this type of crowded tickers i always
recommend that wait
until 10 30 about an hour after market
open
to see if there's an actual fake out or
potential
consolidation swerve to short into
because there is way too much
unpredictable factor in the first an
hour for those crowded tickers
so if you are mainly short sellers uh
there's going to be two
time zones for you to take your
positions first of all
will be between 10 15 to 11 o'clock
that's probably the most predictable
time zone for you to take a position
the second time zone will be anywhere
between three to three
thirty to size into your potential
consolidations
now remember you can not sizing into a
parabolic action because
volume potential that can potentially
squeeze the stock
over 70 percent in most of the scenarios
so in conclusion three things you have
to remember 10 million or under in
pre-market that's not tradable
10 minutes 20 million that's stable or
normal
volume can be traded throughout the day
over 40 million
is basically untreatable and also two
different time zone you can take a short
positions
will be anywhere between 10 15 to 11 and
three to three thirty
now try to not hold a stock overnight
because there's also
unpredictable factor in there as well so
if you want to be a short sellers and
stay profitable and consistent make sure
follow the first rule
now let's talk about the second rule the
second rule is meaning for buyers
if you want to buy something that try
not to buy
into the next day now next day has its
definitions
if you see a chart that trades over 3
400 million volume
in the previous day and the next day the
stock is only trading two three
miniatures in the pre-market
that means in the next day volume it's
not going to
even compete with the first day volume
because the first day volume is way too
crowded
if there is a massive difference between
the previous day and
the current day volume let's say the
volume ratio is
20 to 1. so for example on the previous
day 400 miniature traded
on the next day there's only 20 minutes
here traded
so the volume is 20 to 1. now if there
is a massive difference of the volume
uh between two days then try not to dip
by in the next day because
there's way too much back orders trying
to sell into your
bids and the stock is pretty much
impossible to come back up or to test
the previous high
now let's talk about ideal timing for
buyers to potentially take up positions
throughout the day so first thing you
can think of
is if the stock is not yet overextended
enough
and how should i take a risk and where
should i take a risk
so if you don't find the right timing
for taking on long positions
i do recommend that always take a look
at the volume
if the stock is not creating enough
range let's say
the stock is only up about eighty
percent seventy percent
and it's not over five hundred six
hundred percent on the day
then that's an ideal scenario for you to
take a long positions
as i talked about for pre-market
breakouts uh in the previous videos
that the flow has to stay under 20
million market cap as low as possible
and also there's a either it's a
multi-breakout have a high dense
support or you're looking at the
pre-market resistance
and the majority of the short squeezes
happen in the midday
so if you really want to take advantage
of that if the stock tends to hold
close to 60 percent of the entire day
again and consolidate about two to three
hours
that's where you have to pay attention
to the volume if there is enough fluid
quality
as soon as there's a perk come into the
chart and you can
attract this amount of buyers to push it
off the support level
and cause a huge short squeezes that's
where you should take your positions
before that
and that time zone are normally between
12 to 1.
so for midday breakout it is extremely
tricky
i do recommend to you to track a lot of
data
asag is example that perk through the
midday
and when parabolic eventually hit 20 a
share of a three dollar stock
so that's something that you can take a
look at try to find a very similar chart
and also a similar flow as well also a
similar volume
so that will be all the suggestions for
short timing
long timing and something for you to
look at and also something for you to
avoid as well
hopefully this video is helpful and i do
wish you
stay consistent and profitable in 2021
and i'll see you guys in the next one

hello guys steven dexter welcome to this
youtube videos today we're going to talk
about what happened
to gme and amc and all the sympathy play
that related
to gamestop and also uh what behavior
that surprised all the hedge fund and
what's the reason behind it
so before i start this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
it's going to help us putting out more
videos other than that
today's main focus will be recaps so
let's get into the video
so first of all let's start what
happened to gamestop so apparently there
is a billionaire
that bought one third of the shares of
gamestop
and also there is a war between retail
traders and the hedge fund
on reddit all of the sudden that hedge
fund shorted way too much shares
that's exceeded the current flow after a
week or two
the statistics came out on yahoo finance
it says that there is
four miniatures apparently shorted at 17
to 18 dollars
from the hedge fund and there is another
hedge fund called
cintron research i think they told us on
one of their videos that they
showed it around 40-ish and covered
around
90 so they took a 100 loss but i do
believe there's other people shooting
this as well
that's why it cost such a volatility on
a billion dollar stock it went from
basically two dollars to 500 in waiting
a month
so other than the drama you started with
the retail traders and hedge fund let's
talk about
what happened to the chart and what we
can do to basically predict the next
move
and also to keep you guys safe from over
trading this
massive volatility so let's start with
uh
at the very beginning when gamestop went
up to 150 dollars
on this specific day that caught
majority of the traders attention
the true squeeze came right after the
stock broke the 150 dollars in
after hour and went all the way to 350.
so at this point the short squeezes is
so massive that the hedge fund got stuck
now they got stuck so bad
that they're trying to manipulate it you
can see in the pre-market and after hour
to make it drop but instead
the buyers are not selling that's why
the next squeeze
came right after to the next day you
squeeze all the way to 500.
now due to the volatility was created on
gme
a lot of people are using leverage so
there is a massive
liability on different brokerage that
are hedging
positions on gme so that's why
i think part of the brokerage and some
brokerage restricted
from people trading gme but i think
that's completely wrong they're not
giving people rights
to basically using their leverage and
using their positions
to buy gme and other tickers like amc
and koss
basically the robin hood a rule
that retail traders can only sell cannot
create new positions on gme kill ss and
amc
that's why there's a massive panic and
other people who are trying to
manipulate
and squeeze the hedge fund sold in the
state you can see there's a massive drop
from 483 to 100 and bounced back to 300
now it's up to 352
because robin hood just opened up some
restrictions
that retail traders can buy limited
amount of shares
of gme now let's talk about chart
patterns so the safest
dip by strategy come from the stock
creates mass amount of range
which gme did they dropped about 70 in
about 30 minutes
and this is where you can try to get by
from because you can see there's some
type of support
around 100 and people love to use the
round number as a support
and also you can see there is a support
in january 26
and january 27th so the position that i
created yesterday which i shorted around
near the top around 295 covered
around 2 20-ish and covered
another 50 around 3 12 because i didn't
expect the stock tens to come back again
after that mass amount of drop so by the
end
i came out even i think i took a loss in
the morning as well
using the 380 dollar as a
resistance to shorting to but that did
not work
so i cut my loss quickly then i made a
profit from 295
covered at 220 and covered the rest of
my positions around
3 12. so overall based on the technical
analysis
gme is extremely overextended i do not
recommend people to buy dme
at 351 dollars if you bought around the
breakout around 150
even before then that's ideal to hold so
buying a stock at 353 dollars after
performing the 300
drop is not ideal at all so overall that
drop created way too much back orders
that people are too nervous
and they're selling into the panic and
people who are holding
around 400 are still extremely nervous
because stock did not come back to their
expectations
and there will be very difficult for
buyers
to compete with that setting powers at
four hundred dollars
so overall i do not have any positions
on gme i'm only giving out some
of the technical analysis based on my
years of
day trading other than that make sure to
stay safe and always have a set
of risk for yourself so you don't get
wiped out by all those volatility
created by hedge funds
and that would be all for this video
thank you very much for watching i will
see you guys in the next one
you

we're going to majorly focus on
hello guys steven ducks here so today
we're going to talk about kodk and all
of the sympathy plays that happened last
week
overall i think i made about 500 000
between wednesday and thursday and
friday didn't really make too many
trades before that
we're going to be majorly focused on the
fundamental side and the technical side
fundamental side i'm going to cover the
basics and how you
should choose what type of market cap
zones you should
trade and how it's going to affect
compared to
2016 and 2017 market due to the current
market condition
before i start this video make sure to
click the like button and subscribe
it's going to help to support our
youtube channels because i'm giving
content for free
if you haven't make sure you do it and
let's get into the video
so the first point on the cover will be
the fundamental side now generally we
trade small caps that is considered
anywhere between 10 million to 100
million market caps
due to the market condition we're
currently have the small cap can be
trade
over 2 billion on the day and back in
2017 we're trading around 300 million to
million maximum on that day so you can
see the total dollar that's been traded
on one day increased about three to five
times
and that you have to take that into
considerations
generally we're looking at gap up short
voucher
or overstaying dab down as soon as the
market open now
we're looking under 100 million market
cap range
we'll have to increase that about three
to four times so now the comfort zones
we trade
is anywhere between 100 million to 500
million for me
and that will be my advice to give you
on the fundamental side
just make sure you choose the comfort
range for overextend the gap down and
bounce short
because of that maximum dollar traded
increased that creates more
opportunities for
us especially we're increasing our
comfort zones
to 10 million to 500 million just by
using that method you can get much more
opportunities and you can generate
much more profit as well that will be my
only advice to give
for the fundamental side and let's dive
into the technical side
and there's a couple points i want to
point out on the internet charts
for kodk and how the psychology was
played out
for buyers and short sellers and also
i'm going to attach
the ticker that i made 350 000 on
and giving my entry and exit make sure
pay attention to the entry and exit
and how the psychology was played out i
think is very important for
beginners to understand the chart
overall and let's dive into the chart
so for kodk i'm going to talk about how
you actually
expect from almost from two dollars
three dollars starting to almost sixty
dollars
again over two thousand percent so the
first day
when it gapped up it was trading 50
million volume in the pre-market before
the market even started
and when you see that type of actions
you do not want to actually place a
trade as soon as the market opens
now for these type of crowded trades
they always tend to push
after about 30 minutes after market open
it seems like
all they fader but for gap up short
specifically
that when the stock trades that much
volume
if the volume exceed over 100 million
on one inch a day and that will slowly
change the pattern
now for the maximum fading percentage
especially for
massive gappers that tends to fade all
day
kodka went from 12 to 7. now the maximum
fading percentage
is supposed to be 50 of the entire game
so the stocks still have
rooms to go down after it closes around
seven that's one of the main reason
people held it overnight especially on
the short positions
when the stock traded over 200 million
volume on that same day
and they had a pr in after hour the
stock reversed instantly
and squeezed almost to the day high
that was formed at 10 o'clock
then during after hours stock broke out
held the support
11 and gapped up starting to squeeze
at 13. as soon as the market opened i
think people were shorting
uh because they created enough range
there were no consolidations
whatsoever only in the pre-market
as soon as the stock dipped it starts to
squeeze people from holding the shore
probably around nine or ten and people
who are shorting
into this push which is 21-ish that
massive squeeze
and the stock went pretty much insane
when the stock is
keep halting itself and jumping five
dollars
basically as soon as it opens now the
most ridiculous part i saw
it was jump from 51 to 6 dollars that's
almost 10 dollars a share
and when that type of action happens
short seller gets
really really nervous because you cannot
risk
almost 10 percent in one tick that's
just
way too ridiculous to hold that type of
positions
on the parabolic so as soon as the
parabolic ended the stock
went up to 45 dollars which balanced
relatively high because i generally
don't really see
that type of bounce from the massive
panic
drop from 60 dollars to
in the morning you tested yesterday's
high which is
46 dollars again and it starts to form a
massive consolidations
now that's some type of action you want
to see
when you are preparing for shorting and
as soon as it starts to form a decent
consolidation
and look like it's about to break down
in the afternoon i shorted
a little bit around 38 covered in the
next day i think it's
anywhere between 23 to 24 ish
i'm not very confident holding that long
because
the overall range was created between 3
to 60.
now dropping 50 from the day high
which the maximum fading is around
30. if the maximum goal is to cover at
and you finish the realty week which i
know is going to gap down
in the next day since the market opened
people started to panic and so their
positions
that's where i covered all my shares so
generally i didn't really get a good
cover
but position size still not that big
for what i noticed is when you are
playing the major play
that brings all the sympathy plays
typically i don't really make money
on the major play especially on the way
up i would take about one or two paper
cuts then i'll make a big chunk
after the stock finish is spiking then i
will calculate all my gains and losses
i can only come out with a really small
gang
so i have traded these type of major
players for
a couple of years now it happens pretty
much ninety percent of the time
that's why my main focus is all the
sympathy plays because
all these type of plays they don't
actually have a news they're just
following these type of industries like
pharmaceuticals shipping companies or
bitcoin happening 2016.
these type of companies if they're
spiking based on nothing they will drop
pretty much 90 percent of their entire
gain
after the hype is over so i focused on
edsa which happened on thursday
it was a low flow and i see a lot of
people chasing
it gapped up huge and kodk was losing
its momentum
so all of the sympathy plays as soon as
they opened
dropped miserably edsa dropped 50
in the first hour by looking at the
chart you can see how
profitable we are focused on the simple
display instead of
kodk ko dk consolidated faded really
slow
and also traded way too much volume
super hard to read
the more volume it's trading on the
stock the more competitions
it's going to create that makes the
stock much harder to trade
compared to normal focus on the simple
display rather than the mean play
is a much profitable choice especially
during this type of hype
so my entry on esda is 19 i covered
half at 12 then pretty much reps that my
shares are covered around 10.
and also edsa is probably my highest
profit of the month
so that will be the end of the video
make sure you can
implementing my strategies to your own
strategy and probably make it to your
own
trading is all about yourself you don't
have to focus on other people's profit
but learning about method is very
important and how to really
take other people's good strategy and
potentially
form into a much better strategy by
adding your thoughts into it
if you have any questions please leave a

most of you guys didn't duck sir
so recently there's alabaster's my
Instagram and Facebook
just picture be careful with you know
people contact you on Facebook and
trying to offer you account management
because I don't manage your accounts for
other people I want to trade for myself
and anything that is outside of Stephen
tuxedo man is definite so do not invest
into these type of scams you will get
scammed and you'll take your money and
they will walk away and makes me feel
bad
be careful do not get scared by these
imposters lots of guys doing daxter so
in this video I'm going to talk about my
$80,000 week as a gross profit and
there's some of commissions and fees
involved in there may be about 5,000
days since the barfy are very cheap
recently and they also found out there
is free more new adjustments for people
trying to go along so I will try to
select some of the tickers that stands
out and some of the tickers that I
profit huge and give you a decent
understanding of wise the psychology
behind this pattern because every single
pattern have a based psychology in there
to tell you why the pattern works
why face the logic so before I get into
this videos as I said that profit about
eighty thousand dollars in gross profit
minus the fee is about five thousand so
seventy five thousand and I don't want
to really not show proof so here we go
so here's my account statement you can
see my first profit about two thousand I
didn't really trade down this second the
third then ten thousand fourteen
thousand twenty one thousand the biggest
profit I made on was an IO which I will
go over later I lost about three
thousand on Friday I was trying some we
long strategies and I also will go over
and why I took a loss on that one so
overall within this week I profit eighty
thousand dollars and once you fought
pattern the profits will follow so let's
get into the patterns and figured out
why I showed it I owe and why I tried to
long mark so there's a bunch of details
and psychology involved in there and
there's getting to the tickers so
there's three
seekers I want to talk about based on
what we had on January February and
March
it created a lot of opportunities on the
coronavirus volume so say APR of course
trapped a lot of volume mark this one
also traded a tons of volume I will go
over later because they tried to form a
multi-tier account without any type of
consolidation level and i/o this ticker
was a decent github short into
resistance and also it's a little bit
weird because how the resistance and
support level played out it's getting to
say APR first and then it's followed
with the long short pattern so say Apr
this ticker form the 200 million
resistance are not really high-priced
stocks typically in average volume
putting stock trades about 100 meeting
as a maximum per day so see APR actually
exceed so typically what we know is pain
stock trades about 100 million volume as
maximum entry day say APR actually
traded about 200 million which exceed
the maximum on average which created a
huge amount of resistance around $10
area as you can see stop keep pushing in
two turns and keep failing so that's
where you can select your entry and
swing this ticker for about maybe a
month or 15 days depends on how have the
resistance is and if the resistance are
very solid typically they drop about 75%
in very long time sometimes within your
mouth sometimes within two month
so for capr if you are a swing trader
and you want to be a part-time trader as
don't want to spend whole day trying to
trade in between 932 for this strategy
will be the best that fit for you is
because it's very simple and you don't
have to spend about you know four hours
of five hours trying to your load cap
where it's going to break down so once
you find the entry and you swing it for
about 10 days and select the broker that
doesn't really charge tons of fees
overnight then these type of strategies
will profit you a lot
typically my schedule fits for this type
of strategy I trade anywhere between
9:30 to 11:30
maximum sometimes I get off around 10 so
the more you are trying to look at the
and trying to study I don't really
recommend during the market hours
because a lot of people when they look
at stocks that is going up a hundred
percent two hundred percent they're
fearing of missing now when they have
that type of emotion involved in they're
always trying to force opportunities
that they don't have then they start
making mistakes getting emotional start
making next mistakes that's where they
blow up their account or they get
frustrated that they don't want to
really trade anymore so for study always
recommend study after market close and
only spend about maybe an hour or two
hours to find the best pattern if the
pattern is not there then you just don't
trade it make that day to zero but in a
red so say APR that's my overall
thoughts now let's get into today's
major takers which is ma RK and I Oh
so Mr RK did have an IPO oh I didn't
really show any type of history and you
can see the stock trade about 160
million shares around May 6th typically
when we're looking at a multi-day
breakout we always want to look for a
consolidation or neutralised area now
what do I mean by consolidation then
neutralize area let me give you a decent
examples and why the psychology behind
this pattern works sometimes it doesn't
really work assume I'm a buyer which I
don't really know anything about the
stock market and I saw this ticker
everybody's talking about and trading
tons of volume bonds very sufficient all
of the sudden the stock is spiking from
70 cents to $1 new net
it's a swim I bought at $1 the maximum
that I know the stock is going to drop
to zero so the next day the stock falls
all the way back to 50 cents or 40 cents
and let me give you a decent drawing
right here
so let's say the stock fought fought
back about 60 cents so assume you're a
buyer from one daughter and the side
Ross about 50 cents or 40 cents around
50 to 40 percent in one day and most of
the buyers that doesn't really know
about market when they're looking at
that 40% or 50% loss they will get
desperately they will hold the stock
forever on to the stock combat these
type of buyers we call
well desperation hold now that will
cause the sock former long consolidation
area for a while and once you've formed
a long conservation area which doesn't
really have any type of it equality in
there since the stock perk people will
use that consolidation area as support
to dip by to see if the stock could
perform a potential breakout so in this
case a may arcade didn't really form a
long time consolidation it's because
once the buyers in there if you're not
feeling frustrating of they won't really
hold forever
if the stock keep performs in a
frequently day by day and it's not
really breaking now through the high
which is one fifteen dollar area this
will cause the stock become really
choppy on intraday let's look at fifteen
days and five minute charts you can see
the start did and pulled back start
rubric again because of this tiny leader
consolidation these type of
consideration needs to last about five
to ten days and in this case only lasts
about in after and pre market you can
see the breakout is not as strong
compared to sale DX which we talked
about a long time ago which was a
multi-day breakout that trapped a lot of
volume you had a decent amount of
consolidation time and the shorted
consolidation time is the harder frigid
where tried to break out so on Friday I
was trying to buy the breakout when it
broke this one fifteen dollar area I
forgot about the stock needs to
consolidate for a while that's why I
took a loss because that freaked it out
on me
that's where the three thousand dollar
loss come from for future wise as you
guys trying to focus on what is a
breakout or a long strategy never try to
buy the stock that didn't really form
long time consolidations or solid enough
support and trying to brownie by the
breakout because most likely you will
get fake down that will be my tips on ma
are okay let's talk about my thirty five
thousand yen il this taker
and support and resistance level are
really messed up so let's go over them
first on the historical
first of all you see there's a decent
amount of resistance around 20 million
shares traded on April 2nd
so as the market open the stock is
tracking more volume and the volume
estimate is going to exceed the
historical volume resistance so in this
case what I did is I saw there's tons of
volume in the pre-market and didn't
really create enough range now what we
see in the first half a year in 2020 if
the stock is only up about 70% to 80%
that's not enough for you to really show
into the stock needs to create about 100
percent or 120 hundred 50 percent to
become like a potential short for you
especially on gap up short for IO the
first thing that I saw is overwhelming
pre market volume and I know the bond is
going to trade more than the resistance
volume so the first thing you want to
think of is the stock is going to push
it as soon as the market open and if
you're trying to shore into the pre
market using the historical resistance
that's where you make mistakes as soon
as the market open because in the pre
market is there's really little queries
and can be easily manipulated that's why
I placed a rule for myself and my
student to not trade in the pre-market
no matter how heavy the resistance
volume is it's because when you are
jumping into this type of situations you
always get squeezed about 30% to 40%
iams even 100% and you don't really know
where this is going to end once you wait
after the market open you wait the stock
forms the top then you enter for a short
so for Eyal what I did is I showed it
around 380 ish risking fourth Tony and
the cupboard as soon as they tried to
tempt it to break the previous high
which I did I lost about I think was
three thousand there then I sized the
end once you've rejected for 37 falls
under this resistance so for 20 and for
37 becomes both resistance for you to
risk off and the average turns out to be
390 and ice winded for the entire day
covered around 317 and
add a little bit into this bounce which
is 340 ish and overall I think I made
about $1 a share I showed it about
35,000 shares so profit will be 35,000
NAT sound IO and Amon are okay so that
will be all my analysis on this weekly
recap and thank you very much for
watching hopefully you guys learn
something new you have any questions

that's what guys doing doctor so
hopefully you guys enjoyed the last
video I'm going to make a monthly recaps
for all the trades of this month so stay
into on that today I'm going to
introduce a new strategy for you guys
and it's still in testing process I'm
going to introduce all the concepts and
why you'd need to know the psychology
behind it so the first point I want to
make is a lot of people are knowledge by
reading books that history always tends
to repeat itself and today I'm going to
show you some of the charts that doesn't
really match the criteria some of the
charge that does and it's going to
involve different psychology behind it
and it's getting to the chart first
before I get to the next point
so in here the first chart only
introduced is s rng and this one had
news on Friday they are producing
vaccines for over 19 and still in
testing process basically the stock went
insane based on how much was traded in
average now let's look at in the
histories and to try to give a decent
analysis the volume and how much range
can create by a single day so first of
all when you are looking at stocks you
want to look at the entire histories and
how to start performed for last you know
5 years to 10 years overall by judging
how much range you can create it doesn't
really spike that far and also doesn't
really trade too much volume at once now
the normal range that can be created
around 20% so 3 to 4 4 to 5 and 5 to 6
or 5 to 7 the volume in average is
trading around 5 million to 4 million
per day so what we know is average
volume 4 to 5 million now maximum volume
will be 50 to 60 million which treated
around 2019 in November we knew the
maximum range and we know the maximum
volume let's take a look at on Friday
what happened the stock traded over 500
million value on that day so when the
stock is exceeding the maximum volume is
trading throughout the entire history
that doesn't really prove history always
repeat by itself if the volume arranged
by itself exceeding the maximum range in
volume for the last 5 years you have to
treat the stock completely different so
in
this case when you treat the stocks you
can't really use the historical data to
make a judgment or move to make a trade
I'm sorry II so after this let's relate
to how much volume that can typically
trade in one day in the mid caps when
you track statistics you always want to
track the maximum line can be trading
one day especially in certain market cap
zones now we talked about Murray cabs
owns about a week or a month ago we
separate different market cap in two
different zones ten million to 100
million 100 million to 500 million
thundering - 1 billion and billion more
above now different minor cap zones will
trade completely different volumes and
when you separate them into different
zones let's say sree is between 400
million to 1 billion so the market cap
is on zone 3 which the average volume
can be traded or the maximum on can be
treated is around 100 million 250
million if we have exceptions on a star
on a traded about over 500 million
volume on that day so what we know is
for the future wise this is the
exceptional case we know stock 99% of
the time will not trade 500 million
dollars on one day which we already have
exceptional case and the amount day as
soon as the market opened the volume is
definitely not going to trade 500
million on that day once you assume that
based on the statistics on Monday will
definitely lose enough liquidity
compared to Friday and when a stock is
turns to lose volume now means the stock
is going to drop for the future wise
especially on Monday or Tuesday is
definitely going to do some type of pull
backs and once you have that mindset you
will really help you to make a judgment
on either try to go long or short on
that day these type of method only works
on small caps and any caps are under 1
billion is because when you separate
them into different zones what we know
about small caps is 99% of the company
intends to do offerings and warrants to
make investors lose money and overall
its favored in short in your long term
so let's introduce a new strategy into
bigger caps which is favored in billion
dollar caps now all these bigger
companies tends to have tighter range
and they don't really do offerings and
Warren
is because they do have enough the
queries they have good fundamentals to
support companies based of that we can
use the average volume and the average
volatility to create a brand new
strategy that could take advantage of
billion dollar caps now let's look at a
much bigger cap companies now when we
look at our ten-year histories of how
much funds being traded per day I can
kind of tell the average volume on the
day is around 14 million to 20 million
since we're in the cupboard and it's
affecting you know people are working
and these tabloid events are called
incident now when we're bikina
average day trading volume and how much
range is created by itself what we see
is you can see maybe a five dollar
bouncing range or $5 increase per day so
when we put that into statistics average
volume will be twenty million average
increments of bouncing back and forth
will be $5 which is around 1% to 2% when
we look in a chart most of the time that
stock is trading within that range and
is treating around the same volume per
day if the stock exceed the maximum
range and the maximum volume on the day
we can use that to either dip buy or
short sell let's say the stock increased
$7 to maybe $20 per day right and we
know the average increase and one day
will be $5 so you can use that average
percentage to sure into that day is
because it's bouncing above the average
percentage same thing we can use for day
by if the stock pulls back way too much
average pullback will be around $7 to $5
he pulls back $20 per share then we can
use that concept to dip buy so I'm still
testing the strategies and you need to
find a really stable stocks that
performs average range and with average
volume and if you exceed the average
range and volume you can short or you
can do buy so the only disadvantage of
this strategy is you need to make a lot
of trades that's number one so the
Commission will be our number one
problem second will be some of the
shares are hard tomorrow so you need a
decent brokerage most of brokers that
have heard
our shares are very difficult to get the
cheap shares in this case you are making
a lot of trades and borrowing a lot of
shares so I'm not sure if it's worth it
or not to really make that many trades
per day if you can code a potential algo
by using this no average balancing
strategies LLC can probably work as long
as you have a very good stop and this
strategy cannot be used in small cast so
let's go into all of the points that we
talked about first of all these type of
strategy doesn't really work on small
caps it's because companies are tend to
do offerings and warrants and they tend
to trap a lot of bad odors and they
don't really produce enough volume so
smoke cabs are out of the way so the
second point I'll make is if the banks
see the average following an average of
queries and average range as well we
indicate the historical charts if the
current day volume and the queries and
range exceed the normal range and volume
and you cannot really use the historical
data to judge that intraday actions and
these type of method can be used in
small caps and pure caps as well the
last point will be all of the data as it
can track if you are beginners I will
suggest as I said separate market caps
into different zones and track the
average volume can be treated in one day
and a maximum volume on one day as well
so you will know some of the volume are
exceptional some of the volume are in
average and you can use that to predict
if the stock is going to turn to bearish
or bullish in the next day so sree as I
said 500 million volume in one day and
we know in this type of market cap zones
typical maximum volume will be 120
million to 150 million and the next day
the quality will definitely not exceed
500 meaning in one day so loosening
quality will basically tell us Ernie
will turn into bearish in the next day
or in the next few days and that will be
some of the method you can really use we
are trading in the morning so that'll be
all the points I want to cover hopefully
it's helpful let me know if you have any
questions or the concept is relatively
new
let me do this again so that'll be the
other points on the cover the concept is
relatively new you have any questions

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
that's what guys do index here so today
I'm gonna talk about how to really use
pattern in two different market
conditions not always ask me that how do
i trade xie te ISEE since there are
relatively high market caps so today i'm
going to talk about how to really use
these type of patterns to apply into
harmony cap and how to be really
profitable when you're not trading
something like 40 million flow or 30
minute flow let's get into a chart so X
T is one of the tickers I would trade
round time ago
I think the last round was back in 2016
2017 late 2017 sorry the stock did a
multi-tier on went from 5 to almost 30
as you can see the stock took a long
time to room that far typically what we
see I'm Laura Murray cats they only take
about two three four or five days to REM
from they say one to ten one to twenty
it's very different compared to one of
the ticker that we just traded them
called SES if you take a look at that
one-year chart look back to October 15th
so on October 11th October 14th you only
took about two days to run from 1 to 30
just passage the market absent Merck
marking tabs around 9 million x NE t
markets 400 million at that time i think
is still around the same market cap that
they were offering there and they're
probably the market increased a little
bit but overall I don't think it changed
SES rum to 1 to 30 super quickly in 3
days
X ain't even from 4:30 and took about
like a month typically Harmar caps
takes much longer to spike the same
percentage
Laura Marie captain Spike Lee reacts
lower as well so when that squeeze comes
in you have to be really patient you're
actually like a multi-day breakout you
are expecting to hold at least for a
couple of days so excit when it started
to break out in this 1213 dollar ish
it took about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 days went
from 12 to 28 now SES this one didn't
really show a multi-tier account so in
breaker happened it extends the range
all the way from like 3 to 30 and
there's no pull backs when you want to
trade it's something like this
first bigger market caps were expecting
to hold for a long time
for Lorimer cabs we are trading you are
expecting to hold less than maximum five
hours and you have to cover your
positions or clearable positions by the
end of the day the reason behind the
bigger market caps and smaller market
caps is if you do like a mass just by
using SES as example so if you have a
nine million dollar market tab it takes
about another nine million to make the
start to increase in our 100% now if you
have 400 medium market caps you need
that matter four hundred million to
inject into the market cap for this
ticket inspector than one hundred
percent typically as a day trader we are
trading intraday stocks you have the
idea of how much money in that all of
the day trader it has let's say when
you're tracking multiple tickers at once
now this is the highest volume not
trading on this ticker
so I'm going to put this ticker that
considered as the maximum volume can be
trade in day trading so when you have
that volume you can use that volume
times the price to get the maximum
dollar today on that day so most of the
data that I track typically the maximum
dollar can be trading today is around
like 300 million doubter
and on X nu T the market cap is 400
million so let's put the day trading
volume into the bigger market caps so we
know the biggest volume or biggest
daughter can be injecting to a market
cap is 315 million in one day for XA NT
to spike one hundred percent then you
need the maximum dollar to be poured
into the sticker which is not possible
other 100 samples that there's only one
can be trade that much volume so when
you see a bigger market cap that is
spiking around 100% or 200% you will
know the stock is likely to pull back is
because you know there's only name
amount of money that are existing in day
trading we are shooting to a parabolic
you can use that number you can use the
double to use and can use price actions
to direct you to place like a short
entry for bigger market caps now let's
talk about intraday actions on bigger
market caps as well take a look of
Xfinity that ran for last couple days
you can see the stock gapped up huge
into the sixth hour area while we
normally see it
is when the stock performs the first red
day after a huge resistance created on
that Friday which is October 28th when
the stock has already trashed
fundamentals all we see is something
like this see I learned from three to
five and took about two days one from
five to two point five and you can see
the stock went down exactly where you
started on X T is completely different
so when you start create a huge
resistance and start to downtrend
so for bigger market cap stocks they
generally have little bit more
fundamentals compared to some other
markets ivory trade and there is a
maximum pullback percentages that
attract for almost like a year that most
of the bigger market caps when they
perform a first-rate day there's only
maximum negative percentage that can go
so for that percentage is around
negative to me but six percent so when
I'm trading something like Mark a breeze
over 200 million I'm shorting into a
first right day if the stock gapped down
it's a negative 15 percent in my mind I
know the stock maximum pullback
percentage is negative 26 percent then I
only have about another 10 percent to go
as a risk reward so I'm not going to
sure using pattern called first red day
and that's my thought process when you
are trying to trade the first right day
now for lower market caps you can use
first red day and to read it all the way
down because most of the micro caps they
have really bad fundamentals and they
likely to do offering people don't want
to really hold overnight you don't want
to really hold throughout the day then
they dump the stock and people trying to
manipulate they also dump the stock as
well the negative percentage can
increase to negative 50 percent negative
75 percent so this is why the stock has
potential risk reward if you're shooting
up your first right day now we are
shooting into a bigger caps using first
birthday doesn't really work as well
now the final point the final point when
you take a look at the charts just put
detailed attention into all those panics
you can see right here
morning panic hold that Wallen push back
up panic hold push back up panic hold
push back up pen code push back up clear
specific repeatable actions on this type
of bigger market caps as people are
applying the same strategy into these
bigger market caps it's because they
don't really understand some of the
fundamentals are very solid and we're
trying to sure using that resistance to
get rejected by the end of the day I
think that talk too much is it so the
final point is the bigger market caps
hard to drop smaller market caps very
easy to drop when they're shifting
Momentum's when you want to look for a
dip I look for a dip by that trades a
tons of volume that's number one number
two you are looking for our large
pullback something like fifteen percent
or plus number three when you track data
and you know what's the maximum pull
back on those bigger market cap stocks
then you can use that data to direct you
to get a very good long positions
especially when people trying to use the
first read a pattern apply into the
bigger market caps and can use a reverse
psychology to dip buy into that double
bottom to be able to get a decent profit

so here's how much i made today which is
about 100 000 not smoa showing around
the 13 area and this is a very frequent
pattern that happens over and over again
in the past 10 years so it happens about
40 to 70 times per year and it has a
really strict criteria
so the typical reward you will get from
this pattern is about 30 in a day so to
make 100k you are looking at putting
around 300 000. in terms of criteria i
will be giving out a conference tomorrow
going over all the patterns that i have
especially for this specific pattern so

also guys doing doctor so today I have a
really good news for you guys and that
will be hosting a conference in March
28th 29th and 30th in this conference
will be randomly select 15 people and
will take them to the Nasdaq trading
floor and ring the bell and just
generally enjoying the trading floor
environment the conference will be 3
days the first day will be generally
talking about you know beginner
techniques and will be also covering the
most updated strategy in 2020 and what
techniques have changed going through
and try to adapt in the marketing this
year because I've certainly noticed
something is changing beginning November
last year so we'll be giving most
updated strategy to correlate with your
method to go into the 2020 market and
help you to begin consistent profitable
so the second day we'll be talking about
general statistics and other people are
hurting about them a very good with
statistic sheets I have trapped a tons
of data from 2016 to 2019 and have a
general understanding of how pattern
works and what's a frequency of the
pattern will be giving new updates for
that as well I will give you step by
step to use statistics to help you
generate more profits in the future so
this is more for people our intermediate
level trader and if you're training for
a few years will be benefit you a lot so
the third day we'll be doing a live
trade like the last conference last
conference we made 27 thousand in front
of 200 audience once it's bounced when
they crack that support again I signs
there in that bounce right there you're
gonna see the live trade will pull a
partial recording in this video you can
see the last conference live trade so
lastly we will be launching a platform
which is very suitable for beginners the
platform itself includes my own pattern
their own strategies let's say opposite
in Gap down I have program this specific
strategy into this platform and when the
over sitting gap down potentially pops
up into your scanner you will tell you
this pattern will be a potential publish
name gap down and will help you
generally filter that all the stickers
that help you find the pattern much
easier compared to before that you have
to manually go through every single
taker and route our person gainer and it
wastes a lot of time and also sometimes
because we are trying to find a pattern
you will miss a tons of pattern out
there at the same time so this one could
really benefit you as a beginner too
start learning the market and also we
build this feature as you can use your
own data that you track to invent your
own pattern and find your own edge in
the market and I think will be really
good for you you for just started
trading or you're been trading for few
years I think will be very few you know
long run so that will be all the fraud
conference and let's get into today's
topic so today I'm going to give you a
little bit of content about this
conference and what we'll be including
and beginning I will be introducing
what's a short sell and what is a buy
and hold and how can be probable back
understanding the average reward and the
risk behind it
let's talk about now I'm sure and let's
cut them in two or three different
categories the first one will be the
winning percentage now shorting by
statistics generally have higher winning
percentage numbers you're trying to go
along now compared to the reward same
thing because if you are shooting a
position the maximum reward will be a
hundred percent now average reward would
be anywhere between fifteen to
twenty-five percent using short strategy
across all night raids the first
category that I put them in will be ten
to fifteen percent that will include
some of them takers that doesn't really
fit the criteria but somehow fit the
criteria it's not 100 percent pattern
but it's worth it for a trade so
generally in this pattern it happens
pretty often about a hundred times a
year the next one the reward will be
anywhere between twenty to twenty-five
percent that's where you're the money
maker is and when you are looking for
specific pattern if it fits the hundred
percent criteria you'll generally get
that reward pretty easily
lastly the biggest reward that I have
encountered is you got caught in to your
offering and you're shorting into
offering and in that case you can
generally make about 50% to 75% of your
original investment so category three
we'll be talking about risk that normal
people understanding will be shorting
has infinite risks but pretty much all
the time you will have your own risk
built into your shorting strategy and
generally showing risk percentage will
be around 7% to 10% for me if I'm
shorting this stock I'll be risking
anywhere between 10% to 12% depends on
the patterns winning percentage but if
you're a trader that major in short
you'll know that when you're shorting to
a consolidation there will be some time
have a burst candles that instant caused
a huge short squeeze they don't really
have
the time to get out now after you
realize it's a short squeeze and you
pull off your risk you'll be
automatically down about 30% to 20%
that's one of the biggest risk for short
studying and get cut into short squeeze
in your really short amount of time so I
get a lot of question that people ask me
well Stephen I can't sure how about I
can go long now long strategies are
generally work in the printing stock
where smoke at market by the winning
percentage by statistics massively drops
now let's give you an example so let's
say shorting you're reacting to your
stock and for going on you're trying to
predict the stock so this those two are
completely different no concept we are
trying to track statistics by itself so
I've tracked about 10,000 samples long
strategy generally have about 60% to 65%
winning percentage and the reward will
massively overwhelm the shorting reward
is because when you buy a stock let's
say at $2 you can say 5 units or 10 if
it goes there and the reward will be
sometimes in a thousand percent two
hundred percent but we are ensuring the
maximum words only a hundred percent so
let's talk about the risk of going along
and I think the most dangerous part will
be get caught into offering and start
just straight drops about 75 percent
from its own gain since we all know
small caps or you know micro caps they
all have really bad fundamentals all
they want to do is to do potential
dilutions to gain money from the
investors and then we just do a non
reverse play again and again and we're
compared to you know short and long for
me personally I would rather stick to
you like a high winning percentage and
lower reward and if you really want to
go along you can long into like a very
neutralized area with a really high risk
if they gets volume and gets some type
of news you can potentially gain or 60
percent 100% and that's no surprise
there so make sure understand your risk
and try to invent a way to control your
risk because I see a lot of people
discussing about day trading and day
trading has the most potential reward in
this industry but the Mallory war also
come with the risk so if you know how to
control your risk this game is all about
how to manage your risk and how to keep
your wrist attached as possible to
potentially get a massive amount of
reward so that is the difference between
going on shore and we'll be giving more
tips and content in the March conference
so I hope you guys can join if you don't

uh going forward I believe on January
20th when Trump gets into the White

again so that will place a good bounce
short into the 50s uh depends on where
this going to end up in the before
January 20th so if it hovers around 40
to 45 then I don't think it's really
good opportunity short into a massive

what's up guys Steven Dexter in today's
video I'm gonna talk about some of the
tickers that happen in the last week
since we had a really boring amount on
April there's some decent kickers first
week of May so I'm gonna go over some of
the trades and that I did and some of
the mistakes so meter did mistakes so uh
AEG is on the bounce or you can take a
look and there's a decent resistance in
history one is around the 1.55 ongoing
so on 1.72 and another is around 1.86
and 196 so all the resistance are around
that area nearby two dollar area in this
ticker the markabs were to be really low
so now i'd be really careful with once
the flow start to rotate it's gonna be
really difficult to shorting -
especially in when the market cap is
under 10 median and now we look at the
intraday chart now typically when the
stocks on parabolic work is really solid
volume you don't want to really want to
settings the parabolic you wanna setting
too much to start start to consolidate
so in this case assess them around
around 1.5 and the cupboard around the
1.16 and I was hoping the stock will
fade all day
doctor one dollar ish turns out I didn't
do the choppiness throughout the whole
day and on example in the good day so
this it's really special scenarios that
when the stock is really close to one
daughter because NASDAQ stocks
love to hold their cycle but one to be
able to fit in exact requirements if the
stock falls below one it's likely for
them to get adjusted
that's why the stock does reverse split
once the stock falls below one goes to
couple sin and we do a reverse spell 150
it goes but above $1 again so that's how
we really stay in the Matic market now
we are shorting to a parabolic
I even know your position resistance and
very good risk award but when the stock
is really close to one you're not gonna
cover right about one dollar each
because you don't want to risk not you
don't know you've been the market makers
or company insiders wants to hold above
$1 area typically what I will do is I
would just cover four positions above
one another now that's one of the
factors you have to be pay attention
into when a stock is around 1.3 1.5 0.7
dollar H now G and nu is the one that a
ticker also this one was a gap up short
and now this is also very close to $1 as
you can see the stock is holding above
under area throughout the entire day
even though in the morning consultation
crack typically were morning
cancellation cracks afraid all day
especially when the stock is around
three four five dollar ish so in this
case the stock just barely holding on
loved one we had them Friday morning
squeeze so a lot of people are not
really expecting this but gapped down
the Monday because people doesn't want
to really hold overnight and the cover
of their shorts and when there's no
short in the pre-market people are
starting off and you can see there is
massive support around our area so stock
is still holding entire area and when
you're shorting into those they say the
sides are over a hundred percent but we
are shorting around $1 area you still
don't have any kinds of risk award so I
tend to stay away from something like GE
IET I see th are so couple things go on
a trade first the stock really close to
$1 second the market caps to low under
10 million third when the stock has no
volume not if you look at this say thr
everything was correct and decent
monicab decent flow but you can see
there's non-volley 2.3 37 million
average good day trading morning is
around at least Tony mini on the current
day even though the sub break 52-week is
still not very suitable stock
keep that in mind just be patient
reading for yourself always setting
small even though has a vertical
resistance but the stock price is not
ideal hopefully this video helps I have
a conference coming up in August for
anyone on register I will post a link in
my website in about a week so if I don't
come meet me and watch me live trade
this is the event and thank you very
much and I will see you guys next week

chart reactions how to Wi to top tick
and what is the highest volume on maybe
1 to three million uh float what is the
highest dollar traded on a market cap
between 0 to 100 million right so I
would recommend for myself you would
want to create a chart for yourself so

hello guys s duer welcome to this video
so today this video is going to be very
special for you guys I know the market
has been boring so I have spent the time
that there some conclusions for
beginners so in this video I'm going to
do statistics for beginners uh part one
let me know if it's helpful before I
start this video make sure click the
like button and subscribe let's get into
it all right the first side I want to
show you guys this is going to be a very
helpful tool for you to collect data the
website is called spy kit and you can
pretty much go ahead and put filters
through all the small caps if you're
looking for you can also track
statistics for bigger caps as well and
let's click into one of the templates so
let's say this is one of my gappers open
data I was tracking tickers that was
trading 10 million shares in the premium
market and gapped over 100% and see how
much they actually spiked after market
open and also what is the overall volume
that traded through the entire day and
this one will give you a general I say
data for all the criterias you're
looking for float market cap and gap of
percentages how much Vol tra in the
pre-market and how much while traded
throughout the entire day and the
website itself this tool can also view
the chart on that current day to show
you what exactly it looked like on that
specific day going all the way to a one
minute to two minute chart the chart
itself will help you to study taking a
long time to Lo because there's a lot of
tickers you can pull up multiple
criterias for Gap up shore bounce Shore
multi Runners and if you are trading
bigger caps you're are looking for
algorithm tradings you can track that
data as well and this is a very helpful
tool for you to collect the entire
database and study the database once you
collect the data let's say you have all
the data in your spreadsheets so right
here you want to go into that specific
day and make sure study the level two
make sure study the two-minute chart
reactions how to RN to top tick and what
is the highest volume on maybe 1 to 3
million uh floats what is the highest
dollar traded on a market cap between 0
to 100 million so those are very helpful
criterias for you to track that the
database that doesn't provide so I would
recommend for myself you would want to
create a chart for yourself so you can
screenshot the chart going to that day
and make sure you input market cap and
flow and daily volume manually so you
can remember it next time we review it
so it's not just about tracking your
entire database you also want to make
sure memorize the chart because whenever
you are trading a small cap you don't
have a time to go back and look hold on
wait for me for 10 minutes let me see I
remember a chart called bbby and it had
a very similar reaction or a similar
chart in very intense situations
whenever you're are trading you only
have a few second maybe half a minute to
make a decision so I would recommend
that you manage track or input the
current market cap and Float on that day
when it spiked and everything by
yourself so you can remember what was
the number and once you review it
multiple times you kind of have that
chart in the back of your mind so I
would recommend manual input just for
the memory reason then afterwards you
want to go ahead and track for a very
specific criteria you're looking for so
let's say for bbb1 and we had the
consolidation on jary between 9:30 to
1:00 and the range is around 5 I think
was around 5 to 520 between 480 to 520
so you want to look for that specific
consolidations how much dollar it's been
traded in this case spike it doesn't
provide and you want to see how much it
FedEd those also you want to make sure
it calculate by yourself you can
memorize that in your head well if
you're tracking your data and it shows
the average fading percentage is around
30% or 26% if you want to get more in
detail you want to track manually by
yourself and to make sure recognize okay
what between the market cap around 100
million to 500 million The Fading
percentage is 30% for between 0 to 100
million The Fading percentage is 35% so
there's a very small difference you can
memorize by yourself I would recommend
doing that for yourself then another
thing that I want to mainly Track by
himself after I get the entire database
is you want to make sure that let's say
a ticker has a resistance around 50
million and within 6 months and you're
shorting into resistance that's close to
the resistance you want to track how far
you are from the resistance you want to
track how much volume you traded when
it's approaching to the resistance
what's the highest SP on the 2-minute
chart so next time you can use that in
the same market cap and flow zone so
those are very specific details you want
to track for yourself what's the uh
resistance to volume ratios those are
the very detailed statistics for you to
know as well this is just for multi-
runners and GAP up short there's every
single pattern has its own criteria and
have its own very detailed statistics
for you to track so Gathering the entire
database is very helpful I would
recommend spyy I think this is one of
the most accurate database that I found
in the last couple years you will adjust
based on the reverse split so most of
the time if you don't track intraday
data you won't get the data in that
specific day because the Tiger has
already down multiple reverse splits and
the resistance and the price already
changed and most of the uh platform do
not provide inet data within I think was
within 2 years so if you want to study
the tickers that's all the way back for
or even 10 years ago it's impossible to
pull all the data together so as spikey
this is a very good tool for you to
collect the entire large database for
you to find your Edge for the detail
statistics I would recommend tracking it
manually this this is one of the few
examples that I tracked for myself and
also there is something I want to
mention is as I said that Healthcare
stocks are very difficult to trade and
for a large statistics you want to avoid
pretty much all of the health care
stocks or therapeutic stocks you as far
as possible so for a large database they
don't do that you have to manually
filter the specific sectors out this is
why I found out why Healthcare stock
because by tracking I say a th samp Po
and I would say 80% or 70% of them do
not follow the average pushing
percentages or the average fading
percentages it has its own statistics so
that's why I tend to avoid pretty much
all of the biotech sectors in my trading
career okay so here is the beginner
tutorial for it you can also look
for the tutorials on YouTube as well so
let me give you guys example let's say
you want to name this as galop tour I
want to look for a data between let's
say starting around 2017 all right let's
go into input your criteria manually so
first of all you want to look for add
files so you want to look for stock
symbols or security class and you can
take off those ETFs and units so you're
just looking for Common Stocks so can
add the filter in there then for daily
you want to see okay well I'm looking
for tickers that traded 50 million
shares throughout the entire day or 10
minute shares in the premarket so daily
is how much volume traded throughout the
entire day not looking for crowded
tickers tickers that trade did maybe
less than 100 million shares throughout
the entire day then if you want to look
for tickers that traded in the premarket
let's say starting time is 4 a.m. in the
morning to 9:30 a.m. before Market open
this is the ticker you want to look for
ticker that traded less than 10 minutes
shares throughout the entire morning you
are now looking for ticker that traded
over 100 million shares throughout the
entire day whatever you want to input
the volume typically I look for B less
than 10 million shares throughout the
entire day and majority of the tiers
that traded over 10 million shares in
the Prem Market becomes extremely
crowded and it's impossible to trade
especially on the first screen day then
you're looking for did the company has
news what's the market cap what's the
current growth you can filter pretty
much all of the market cap between let's
say this is very beneficial for if you
are looking for a specific market cap
zones and flow range you are looking for
market cap between 0 to 100 million and
flow between 0 to 10 million then you
want to switch to 100 million to 500
million market cap and 10 million shares
to 1550 million sh outstanding so you
can use this tool to filter out all the
market cap zones to look at what is the
average backing percentages for a
different market caps so by tracking
this specific statistics you can avoid a
lot of squeezes especially on the
smaller caps so those are just very
simple examples you can input your
criterias into the filters and you can
look for the past 10 years of data so
very helpful tool and uh in the next
video I'm going to talk about how to
really track more of the detailed filter
to increase your winning percentages on
your specific pattern all right guys
that'll be end of this video thank you
very much for watching if you guys are
looking for tracking statistics by

my uh account statement and look at what
I traded what what I'm supposed to trade
what I'm not supposed to trade okay now
there's some losses that I'm supposed to
lose that's okay yeah but you you have
to recognize what you are supposed to
lose what you are not supposed to lose

and there's offerings pretty much on all
of the botex uh botex they do reverse
splits and they do offering they do
warrants and there's a bunch of active
warrants in the stock and the stock is
trading let's say anywhere between 1
million to 5 million float and these
type of tickers they typically do not
perform very well because if you see
there's active warrants that's ready to
go and sometimes the company doesn't
have to issue the warrants in that
specific day and if you're short a big
size based on warrs you're going to end
up with a massive squeeze so majority of
the time when you see a bunch of wors
you see botex they just fade completely

seeing ticket going from 2.25 to5 so
that's extensions about 100% uh I sting
a little bit early because I haven't
seen a boun short for a very long time
so I sized in very small I think was
5,000 shares here and 25,000 shares
around 4.5 so my average is total is
right around right here so 4.25 uh 420
to 4.25 around uh 4.75 so only made
about 50 cents on this chart this is

================================================

Kind: captions

[Music]
hello guys steven dexter uh welcome to
this video haven't done a video for a
while so for today specifically i want
to talk about the overall trend for the
penny stocks and what will happen in the
future
from what i noticed and from what i
attract uh starting from this year
beginning of 2022 so a lot of things has
changed and we're in this
crazy
inflation geopolitical crisis
so i just want to give my take of how
the market is going to go and how's that
going to affect the small cap market and
what we can do to be able to be
profitable in the future
so first thing i want to talk about is
the stimulus check from 2020 to 2021 or
late 2021
and that specifically pump up the market
so there's tons of people having the
money
injecting into the market and pushing
the market cap into a i would say a
higher standard uh and that also
bought tons of um
mean players like dwc dogecoin
kodk and gamestop and
amc et cetera for those meme plays
specifically i have prof lid
at least i would say 15 million or above
on the downside on the upside didn't
catch it
but there's specific technical analysis
you can be able to
profit from the upside as well
but i'm mini a short setter what i have
noticed from all the meme plays
starting from 2021
at the beginning
the volume has significantly dropped at
the beginning of 2022 so there's not
much
uh tickers has been going over two
thousand percent one thousand percent uh
every single week
and the last time the last time i've
shorted a ticker indio has been the only
trade that i've placed uh for the last
four months and i made about four
million dollars which i will be
uploading the live trading into youtube
so stay tuned on that
go back to the data and what i've
noticed that the volume has dropped at
least 30 to 50 percent especially on how
much else the dollar is being injected
into a specific market cap zones so
under one billion dollar market cap
the max amount of dollar can be put into
a ticker
is around three to four billion and what
i noticed recently it has dropped about
1.5 billion so overall 50 percent
sometimes it's thirty percent so you can
see the confidence level from the retail
trader part uh has been losing
significantly just within short period
amount of time so that also means
uh the stimulus check is running now so
we kind of have to take a step back and
look at the 2018-2019 data how we have
been trading in that
uh time period so we can figure out you
know
what pattern works what pattern doesn't
work anymore and we then we can adjust
our strategy
to
actually to fit the current market
condition so without further ado let's
get into today's chart i'll show you
some of the data that i have noticed and
also giving you what i would say the
overall take on the general market
so this is what we had um
i would say
so about two weeks ago
h usa and indo
all right so let's take a look at hsa
this is a simple display of indo and
this is where i showed it around
14 added into this panic
right about here so my average is around
13 ish 13 uh 13.9
um
right about here
then it dropped back up to
5.85.9 so my average coverage is around
6.5 6.9 ish
um i made about 50 percent on this short
trade
uh plus the indo so so the reason why i
am deal dropped
is because it had this huge
you had to sell off on monday
um then gapped up on second day this is
a classic oversteering gap down i traded
about
a day so
70 million volume
uh that's 5.6 billion dollar block if
you try to compare the volume between
two days
uh before the market open you only
traded about 500k volume so
it's not enough to contest with the
resistance that was formed yesterday so
that's why i picked my shorting spot i
think it's around 70 my average is
around 70.
covered
36 half added around 47 cover arrested
at 40. so i didn't catch the last drop
from 41 to 30. and
a lot of people are confused about how
did you pick up the entry from
hsa so
as
indio
is the main leader of the energy sector
play because
uh crude oil has been skyrocketing
and it will cause tons of
dependent stuff to go with it as well so
hosa is the sympathy player of india
since i showed the india that's where i
showed it husa and
while you are live trading you can kind
of notice
is that uh simplified normally drops
much faster than the main player so
that's why i sized in much heavier on
hsa i think i made around two point
five million dollar on hvsa and one
point and what 2.3 million dollar on hsa
and 1.7 high ndo uh this is the only
major trade that i placed in i'll say in
the last four months
so uh market has significantly slowed
down but what we can learn from this
behavior is if you take a look at uh
what's been hot is we had this ukrainian
war and they sanctioned russia all of a
sudden
oil will become a big problem so all the
energy sectors beginning to um
run up
so
in the future uh if the market tends to
crash and people start to run into
commodity either it's silver
agriculture
stocks or
gold stocks so gold mining company from
the penny stock sector will likely to
spike again so those will be
the sector you want to be focused on and
those
will be your i would say only
major gains from 2022 because you can
see that the market is definitely taking
a step back on how much longer it's been
trading and how much
i'll say meme stock has been running in
the last couple months so
be careful of going around because
tickers has not been gaining enough
volume compared to 2021 so
and also be careful going short but
since the bond has been dropping you
cannot size in else the same amount of
shares you can size in 2021 because you
cannot exceed one percent of the entire
shares being traded
uh throughout the day so if the ticker
is only trading about a couple hundred k
in the pre-market that means you cannot
setting over 100k after market open so
those are the things you want to be
focused on
on your side
and on which sector you're supposed to
be trading and also
make sure you track data along with it
as well
all right guys that'll be the video and
recap for the day and make sure you
click the like button and subscribe uh
and also my indio lab trading will be
coming in next few videos and also make
sure to leave a comment of which topic
that i supposed to talk about

================================================

Language: en
what's up guys doing duck sir today I
want to talk about some place that
happened recently that have worms inside
of the stock and this training massive
element shows get squeezed every single
time when I see it so I wanna give a
brief detailed explanations about a ETI
and Bo and K so those are the two major
stocks which I'm gonna talk about and
I'm also gonna talk about BK t X and ay
B XL for tomorrow's potential play so
they started its get started with a ETI
so as you can see the stock had the news
I think it was a contract winner they
reward it for 14 million doing some
project and the market caps are really
small and it's also a low flow so it
went from a one to two point four - I
think we might share a miler today in
the ones I don't really buy low flow
stocks so I don't want to roll it and I
don't want to see people call me bumpy
but I do give my comments in in my chat
room so people bought it I think they
are 1.1 and 1.25 isch and the soda into
tubes making a hundred percent of their
gains and when I see this kind of stocks
on the first green day if you took a
look at the entire historical chart
there's no actual voluntarily underneath
so you don't know where the resistance
is and when people are showing it and if
you are shown in without the resistance
in the history in the history and you're
showing only using the intraday
resistance and that will be a really
risky method to go for Shore into the
first green deck and as you can see how
this 1.9 support perfectly and squeezed
all the way to 2.4 I think some people
are shooting in twos
because they're thinking there's like
500,000 Warren's
placed in 2.25 I think this area ish and
the Pearl key started start with the new
high and the
squeezed again and I into afternoon I
just straight dumped into the 1.7 so for
tomorrow's play I'll be looking to short
this and I think it's a range of
dropping it's a little bit too high so
if it doesn't gap up tomorrow
I'll be looking to short it and be
careful with those high volume traded on
the first Green Day because 500,000
warrants does not compare to 30 million
bond trading under the current day so
same thing with the BL and K if you if
you took a look at the one must chart
and the very beginning of the day that
spiked I think there are warrants placed
around 4.25 ish and the bottom was
feeling massively so people are showing
underneath the warrants thinking if the
star reached that specific price range
they can exercise their warrants but
turns out is squeezed all the way to six
dollars so you can't really risk the
warns and to use warrants to shorten to
that just doesn't play well with those
technical that very bullish technical
charts especially like people appeal
okay so this is why have we really
careful and if a chart it's telling you
that's really polish and technical no
matter how bearish the fundamental is
don't ever shorting aim using intraday
resistance or using fundamentals at your
resistance it just doesn't work as well
look at the stock went all the way to
think of for long term squeeze to eight
are like almost nine dollars so if
you're shooting you are down 100 percent
and be really careful about it and also
choose the right side so we'll see the
volume is overwhelming the warrants
don't use that to shorten to very
dangerous and also let's talk about be a
V KTX I think a lot of people are
cherlene in or allowing or showing it
and the discharge did not do nothing for
the past five years except for the past
week and the chart was trading 50
million volume on a day or 60 meaning of
around the day and you nobody know where
the top is and it's a really high market
cap stocks so until the chart forming
actual resistance don't guessing if it's
going to drop or it's gonna go up using
the correct resistance to choose where
you going short into or where you're
gonna go down so play into those first
green days are really risky not and it's
also coming with a huge stress so you
want to trade prints less stress and
high winning percentage that's all you
need to focus
he only needs to catch Sybil when trade
two remaining the year not every single
trade because nobody can it's also
talking about a B Excel I think was
decent gainer today we're not almost 37
percent and if you took it the yearly
chart now the stock has consistent
resistance for the past year or two but
not really heavy consistent so you went
from 2.8 to for daughter and you can
solder in the mid day so I'm probably
gonna use that as my support to defiant
you I depends on how the gaps so that'll
be the for place for today and I hope
you guys know something new and if you
guys are asking where the chatroom is I
begin getting a lot of question about it
and I will place a link underneath my
video so go ahead and click that link or
direct it will direct you the the
chairman page so I'll be it and thank
you very much you guys have a great day

we see that volatility increased about
what some guys didn't tuck sure
hopefully guys enjoy the last video and
in this video I'm going to cover several
points that cost me a hundred thousand
missed aches and four hundred dollars in
profit if I can realize these type of
mistakes earlier I could save me a ton
of money so I personally consider this
it's a very valuable lessons and make
sure take some notes you have any
questions leave a comment below and
before I get into this video make sure
to click the like button and subscribe
and let's get into it recently we've
been seeing a lot of increased
volatilities and that got tons of
statistics from you know different
brokers and the number of people trying
to open up new accounts based on
Robinhood statistics went from 2 million
to 12 million so that's six times more
than usual compared to 2017-2018 now
we're looking at the volatility in
recently average bowing would be getting
back in two years ago was around
anywhere between 20 million to 40
million per day highest would be 100
million now recently we've been getting
around 70 million to 100 million daily
and highest Obama had been seeing for
last week will be 500 million per day
now since we don't really know if that
statistics was correct based on no one
from 2 million to 12 million
I'm the new accounts and we can use the
recent volatility to verify if the
Robinhood statistics was correct as I
said the numbers anywhere between 20 to
40 million per day in average back in
two years ago or six months ago and we
have 70 million two hundred million the
highest will be five hundred million so
100 million to 500 million that's five
times more than usual if you want to
average the people that trying to open
up new accounts in interactive broker e
Trade Center Point or 3-0
whatever brokerage you want to use then
Elvis is around five times or more so we
have the accurate number volatility
increased about five hundred percent and
people trying to open up accounts
five times more than usual once we
verify the statistics
accurate let's get into a different
viewpoint how do you really take
advantage of the increase of
opportunities now let's get into typical
market caps for you guys are relatively
new we majorly trading in small caps and
now we're trading mid caps or bigger
cash since there's so many opportunities
banging around for the last month the
average market cap were been trading is
around 10 million to 50 million average
flow whipping tradings around 3 minutes
of 5 million right
personally back in 5 years ago I was a
beginner and that also taught many
students that started as a beginner as
well this is a very common human
behavior when you try to go long on
stock as a noob if you don't really know
anything about the stock market haven't
seen something that it's over you know
increased 200% you want to get into get
more profits and of the sudden the stock
drops about 50% so you are holding out
$1 drop to 50 cent you're feeling kind
of desperate you don't really want to
take that 50% loss so your next instinct
is to hold up positions for a long time
on to the stock combat you can sell it
to break it even now this table
mentality will affect many many traders
that comes into the market as a brand
new trader as we seen the volatility
increased about 5 times or more than
usual that means there is much more new
trader trying to involve into the same
game let me give an example so back in
two years ago
there's about hundred people and there's
10 people that will hold forever if the
startup 50% now we have 500 people
trying to get into the stock and there's
at least 50 people trying to hold stock
forever now that will increase about 5
times or more compared to usual now
since we have a set amount of flow is
anywhere between 3 million to 5 million
right since the amount of didn't change
and there's more people trying to trade
the stock and there's more people trying
to hold us up forever that will decrease
the supply in order to increase the
price that's why we're saying
gap up short first right day or about
sure their behavior is getting much
lower than before
so in order to adapt into the current
market condition we want to increase our
normal range of flow and market caps so
what I did is
we'll increase all of the project cap
range times five and all the flow times
five so the normal market cap were been
trading from two years ago will be
anywhere between ten million to 50
million and we want to increase that
about five hundred percent so three
million to 5 million statistics that
we'll be using two years ago times five
will be anywhere between 15 million to
25 million if we increased amount of
market caps and the supply that volume
will treat this type of market cap as of
typical low flow and no cap stocks and
basically nothing has changed we're
beginning our opportunities and that's
where you can take advantage of all the
statistics that you track from 2016 2017
and 2018 on github sure first rate day
overstaying gap down whatever pattern
you want on call and that's where you
can take big profits from back into the
beginning of the year during January and
February that's where were starts to
transition into the current volatility
while we have now and I wasn't very
prepared I was just using the average
statistics trading the volatility that's
happening right now that's where I took
several losses because those gap up
Shore and bounce sure and some multi-day
breakouts that doesn't really fit the
statistics and you affect the charting
behavior into very weird range and I've
been getting faked out a lot back in
January and February now I have already
adapting to the current market condition
and volatilities I starts to profit a
lot more compared to last year so based
on all the points that I talked about
last 15 minutes this is the perfect
examples for you to really change your
strategies and to adapt your strategy
into apparent market conditions and you
can use this type of examples to apply
in two different options or futures
you're currently trading once you
already adapt into the current market
condition then you can come up with new
strategies since there's much more
volatility than usual what we're getting
is much more opportunity than usual and
also increase the frequency of the
pattern before that you will take a
month or two to really adapt your
strategies and to change where you
should enter we should exit and it sucks
you will take several losses in the row
but when you look back
fit your mistakes rationally and to
figure out what you did wrong and what
can you do to make it better so that
will be all for this video thank you
very much for watching you have any
questions please leave a comment below

SOURCE VIDEO: What I have learned from my biggest losses. [MG6eYmEGa4w].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys it's steven day traders and
mento here so in this video i'm going to
talk about biggest losses that i
personally experienced and also giving
you guys the lesson of what i learned
what's the solution of how to
really get over the biggest losses and
to recover your confidence so first of
all uh let me give you a little bit
about my personal experience uh there in
my first
half year of trading i've turned
27 000 into about 60 000 in the first a
month then i took the biggest loss on
bbig which is only about 15 000 loss but
my unrealized loss went up to 55 000. so
i was pretty much on the edge of blowing
up my account
after that loss i
really adjusted my strategy because i
was using strategy that a certain amount
of tickers cannot go over 500 percent
that's the
limit of how much stock can push in one
day so
bbig went up up to 900 in that day
so i wasn't very sure about how to
really manage my risk if the stock goes
over of what i tracked so i was sitting
there feeling a little bit miserable and
not sure what to do and i let my loss
keep growing and going and going he went
up all the way up to 59 000 at the top
and i only have a 62 thousand dollar
account so it was a terrifying
experience after that loss
luckily stock got halted went up to
0.325 dollars and went to five to three
so i always managed to come out with a
fifteen thousand dollar loss but that
loss really taught me about okay never
look at the stock into how much they can
spike in one day uh that's a very
important lesson for beginners
if you see a stock running ten thousand
percent or twenty thousand percent in
one day there's no limit for them to go
up so always follow your rules and stick
to your risk management because that's
the most important part in your trading
career
the second last experience was over
trading this is one of the major
problems that a lot of people
give up on trading once they make a
first loss they will tend to
make the second attempt
to recover their loss
that they made in the first place and if
they make a second loss then there's
goes
pretty much an infinite chain reaction
until you realize what you did and at
that point you already lost 50 of your
account so i actually did that once i
don't remember what ticker it was
but i traded at least 12 times on that
day each day i took 20 000 loss
i took about two hundred forty thousand
dollar loss
uh with a six hundred thousand dollar
account so that was a pretty big loss
after that i learned that if i make two
mistakes on the same ticker
you cannot trade it ever again you have
to wait until tomorrow
because
the more trades you are a place in one
taker the more losses you are likely to
experience that's from my personal
statistics that i've been tracking for
myself
if i trade more than two times on one
ticker i am likely to lose more and more
money
so after that lesson i learned that i
will never place one and two trade in
the same taker and always i'll have to
ask myself that what pattern am i
trading especially i'm placing on the
second trade does it fit my risk reward
and is it really worth it for me to
trade and also
can i use this method
to make money in our long term uh if i
only make money in this you know
specific one time i might lose it in the
future so that's something that you have
to take into considerations as a
beginner trader uh very important uh is
your pattern consistent and whenever you
are making a recovery trade is it really
worth it for you to put this habit in
your head than to potentially either win
or lose in the future so the last
mistake i typically make is random
trades sometimes you wake up in a bad
mood and you place the round trade and
you don't lose too much but in your long
term it does add up so this specific
habit i think everybody has it sometimes
you don't really realize but you have to
be willing to face your mistakes i
always go into my account statements and
find out okay
this trades is necessary this trade is
not very necessary
and that will layer out you know what
trade is random what type of trades it
fits the pattern but i still took a loss
but losses are manageable and this trade
i have to place this trade because it
does have a good risk ratio so once you
select out all the random trades you can
add them together to see how much money
that's worth in total so
for the last year
the total loss is about one or two
million dollars it's a pretty
significant amount each time you may
take about 50k laws 70k laws here and
there and all the random trades tends to
add up as a consistent profitable trader
you want to
keep your
trading record
as clean as possible so you know that
you're focused on the right thing
staying disciplined
the more right trades you make and the
less random trades you
make in your career that will just
generate much more money for you so if
you don't see a specific trend of how
you are making
rent and trade that's a good sign for
you but if you see
that you are making you know 20 of the
renting trades that equal 20 of your
losses or profit that's something you
have to slowly cut it out
those type of disciplines doesn't happen
in one day then if you can recognize it
make a plan for it
that's where you can slowly become a
much better trader in the future that's
something i'm currently working on as
well
so the last point i want to make is
account distribution this is
something that you can use to protect
yourself from blown up account
let's say that you
are being consistent you made
from 30 000 to 100 000
what i will do is i will split those 100
000 in three different accounts 30k 30k
and 40k
i will use 40k to trade and 30k as my
backup account and 930k in my bank
account so in this way i have about two
chance to screw up and if the market
tends to change on me a little bit i
will have
backup account for me to adapt to the
current market conditions and come back
again so in this way it protects you
from
never being trading again as i said the
longer you're staying in this trading
industry the more likely you'll become
more and more experienced and get better
with it so you cannot
risk
the capital that if you lose you cannot
trade again that's something that will
just end your career uh in one go so
make sure
that always separate your equities and
putting up at least one backup account
uh to keep you safe from making those
really big mistakes when the market
really adjusts itself so that will be
all the tips that i learned from uh some
of the biggest losses that i experienced
personally i think it happens to the
retail traders out there as well so if
you're a beginner make sure you know
write down whatever uh that's important
if you are over trading or you are
making random trades
i already give you the solutions work on
it slowly
the most important part will be
discipline and manage your risk so that
will be end of this video thank you very
much for watching i will see you guys

SOURCE VIDEO: What action differentiates Larger Market Caps from Smaller Market Caps (Dux Runner Analysis) [hJvyRsamz1I].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys welcome to the new video
lessons of the week and today we're
going to talk about why small caps and
bigger market caps are different um so
why we used to be trading our 1550
million to 500 million or under now
we're dealing with uh 2 billion 10
billion market cap and we're looking for
that massive drop like penny stocks that
and people keep shorting to
these first overextended charts of bid
and market cap they tends to come down
very very slow so I'm not expecting this
to go from 11 to 8 in a day and
basically want to trade these you have
to swing uh then they do not have good
enough risk reward uh for intraday with
a really good pattern and I see people
keeps overtrading and keeps shorting
into all those strength and they all got
squeezed then each time you don't get
squeezed that much because their range
are really small but people tends to use
a bunch of Leverage on those CN and uh t
y um and I don't suggest doing that
because um with larger market cap you
don't know what it's going to do as we
mentioned uh crowed trades are really
unpredictable then it's almost the same
thing because uh Crow trades are more
volume and More Dollar pulling into this
specific ticker and with B market cap
it's also the same thing there's more um
money and volume put into this same
ticker and this start become super
unpredictable and you're looking for
this um morning spe to fail and it can
go higher than you think or they can go
even higher and squeeze you out so all
those things are really difficult and I
see a lot of people uh losing money on
these and don't trade the pattern you
don't know because uh I have trade s a
couple times and I lost small uh almost
every single time and people are looking
to catch something like s drop from 11
to 8 because Centron research released
some some bad news on them and in turns
out ultimate bounce back all the way to
where it uh spikes to so all those
things you don't really know what's
going to happen next and as small caps
uh with all the back orders you can know
what's going to happen in the next 10
minutes after market open but on these
it's very unpredictable and also you
have to use nage to make something out
of it and uh once they squeeze you you
lose a huge you don't even know why and
that's something I always emphasize in
the market trade something you know
don't trade something you don't know and
that's just purely gamble it's probably
less 20 percentage than
gamble uh other ticker I'm going to talk
about is uh
GMP uh on Friday and I Fades all the
back so looking to maybe some bounce
into the 2.4 area to short into and they
didn't trade that much volume so uh that
means less size and uh more uh breaking
your positions into sever parts to add
into because smaller volume tends to
have higher Spike than you expected so
that's why you have to break your
positions into several parts to be able
to get a really good average uh that's
my general thoughts on all those little
B traded
tickers and I will be hosting a UCB
conference or more like a presentation
and it's free to come you guys if you
guys are interested to learn more about
P stocks to learn more about um
psychology behind it how does it work
how does the pattern Works uh you're
more than welcome to come and I will put
a link in my website and it should be up
on Monday or Tuesday so you can go ahead
and register your spot there's only a
liit amount of spot yeah if you're
interested make sure to check it out

SOURCE VIDEO: What are the best brokerages for day trading？ [jHWGc-U2fRk].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys liam dexter welcome to these
videos and today we're going to talk
about the pros and cons
for different brokerages and also the
borrow fees for different brokerage as
well
and before that we're having a platform
coming out it's going to be called
starcraft
it's a scanner that can scan for
different strategies that
you're interested let's say you're
interested into a bounce short you can
input the criteria into the scanner and
you will scan for the bouncer that you
wanted to see
for that specific day so it's going to
be very suitable for people that's going
to approach into the market
more of a systematic way if you're
interested make sure
click the link below we have a pre-sale
going to come out
very soon and let's get into the video
so as a beginner in 2016 2017
i had trouble choosing different
brokerage because the fees were
basically taking out
20 to 30 percent of my net profit that
doesn't really include
the ecn and the normal execution fees
it's all comes from the hard borrow fee
so this is one of the i would say major
problem if you get into
around a hundred thousand to two hundred
thousand dollar account
and there's also some brokers you can
use
to minimize that if your account size is
under 10 000 or
30 000. so first of all let's talk about
loan strategy first
so if you're a long biased trader and
you want to minimize the fee
as low as possible you have to do some
type of calculation let's say that you
normally trade anywhere between 3 000 to
5 000 shares
between one or two days so interactive
brokers basically charges
money per share and if you're trading
large amount of shares
well interactive brokerage might not be
worth it
and e-trade they basically charge a
fixed amount
for one trade no matter how many shares
they're trading
i think there's up to a limit but they
only charge about
i think it's around seven to eight uh
back in 2017 2018
per trade that's for specifically for
long
and they charge short interest for hard
to borrow stocks
but normally that e-trade doesn't have
enough availability especially for
shorting
or low flow so in terms of flexibilities
interactive brokers does have more
options you can choose
dollar per share you can also choose
dollar per trade so
e-trade i think it only has the option
for dollar per trade
and ever since 2018 i moved down into
trade zero and guardian then now i'm
using regal security so i'm going to
explain what's the pros and cons for
shorting strategies
and what's the best option for
especially
swing assured positions for two to three
days maybe two to three weeks
and what i figured out for the last two
to three years
is that short interest is much better
than holding overnight especially with
your borrow fee times three times five
that is just not worth it
because i have tested my strategy my
strategy actually works
but overnight fees are taken now maybe
to 25 percent sometimes even 30 percent
so whenever you are shorting a stock you
are thinking about holding overnight and
you had a really good entry but if you
can't borrow fee in
your entry is not very good if you
manage the borrow fee and actually
reduces
your profit margin so the concept is
very simple
if you borrowed a thousand dollars worth
of stock
and you want to hold overnight depending
on the trade zero current
uh holding overnight plan they normally
charge times
seven now the charges times five so the
stock itself
still have to cost you five thousand
dollars to hold overnight
just for the fees if the stock doesn't
have
another 20 to 30 percent drop potential
uh it's not worth it to hold overnight
that's why trade zero is
almost for intraday shorts almost all
the time
and the guardian is a little bit
different they do have
a plan that if you are planning to only
trade
25 000 shares or below then you can
enter this plan by paying a monthly fee
so you don't have to cost you money
every time when you borrow a different
stock that's also very suitable
for account it's between let's say fifty
thousand
to five hundred thousand if your account
is above that
uh most of the time you're going to
short more than 25 000 shares or trade
more than 25 000 shares
that's where the plan is not very useful
because you can borrow
more than 25 000 and that's actually
going to reduce your profit as well
so for different traders make sure which
area you are landed in
and to choose the best brokerage that
fits for you
i would say interactive brokers and
in-trade interactive brokerage
are suitable for account within three
thousand to five thousand
e-trade i would say it's suitable for
long
and swing strategies up to millions
and uh guardian and trade zero trade
zero are more suitable for
account that is over thirty thousand and
you're almost
placing injury traits all the time not
worth it to hold overnight guardian
i would say it's probably currently the
best for
swing short if you plan to hold two to
three weeks that's my personal
experience
for using them about two years now so
that will be end of this video
and whenever you are choosing a
different brokerage make sure that you
track
every around six months to a year to see
how much fees that's actually taking now
your net profit
so you can kind of have the idea that
you don't want that amount to exceed
over 30 percent of your profit
because that is very important and don't
blindly borrow shares before
the action happens normally that you're
into a wasted borrowed situations and
it's not going to feel very good
and also make you very formal to trade
different stocks in that day
so hopefully this video is helpful um
let me know if you have any questions
please leave a comment below and i will
see you guys in the next video

hello guys steven doctor welcome to this
videos and also welcome to my house i
will be doing a house tour in the next
video or two but today i have a good
news for you guys we're officially
launching our platform which is called
starcraft i've been telling you guys for
a very long time and we have two
features on the platform so far uh one
simulations and one strategy builder so
you can build your strategies and run in
the past five to ten years in the market
to see if your strategy is actually
working or not so this is a really good
feature that beginners can really test
out their stuff before they go into the
real-time market and to prevent them
losing tons of money because they don't
have the edge so the second feature
we'll be adding on in the future is
pattern scanners so let's say
overextending gap down bounce shore or
gap up short all of the pattern will be
scanned now of the scanners before
trying to find the right criteria so
those features will be very important to
add on in the future but right now we
have simulations and strategy builders
and a very well developed charting
system as well so if you're interested
make sure to check the link below and
let's get into the video so today we'll
be talking about the most profitable
indicators throughout the market in 2020
and 2021. as a beginner the first couple
indicators you'll be learning will be
rsi view app moving averages those
indicators doesn't really work that well
their average winning percentage is
around 50 to 60 percent uh personally
i've been testing them for a very long
time so the most important thing in this
market for you to be a consistent
profitable trader our first thing you
have to learn is
trading psychology is because all those
indicators are invented by people who
are trading in this market for a very
long time and back in the days it might
work for them but now it probably won't
work very well the reason is there's way
too many people knowing this pattern
everybody's using the same indicators
that's why
when the indicator performs a bullish
trend but it's actually going to reverse
to a bearish trend
the problem about this market is 90 of
people tend to lose money in this market
and that's one of the reason that many
people use one indicators that it's not
going to work
if there's way too many people using it
at the same time so i've been actively
trading in 2020 to 2021. um there's a
big change compared to
the trading years in 2018 to 2020
and in those two years uh the biggest
and the most profitable indicator will
be volume especially volume forecasting
there's way too many shares going into
the market so you have kind of to figure
out okay
what is the limit for
intraday volume so let's say we have an
average volume that's trading around
100 million to 200 million but after
tracking about 100 samples we know the
top limit for this volume will be around
400 million to 500 million so when we
know that type of volume and we know
that okay so on this one specific day
vol the max limit for volume would be
400 to 500 million then i should
probably start setting my positions
because it's unlikely to track more
investors into the stock and that would
be a really good reason for you to sell
the stock or try to switch from the long
positions into a short position
so the second way you can use for volume
forecasting will be pre-market volume so
let's say that a ticker is trading one
million volume in the pre-market
compared to a ticket that's trading in
20 million volume in the pre-market so
well definitely though that the second
ticket will trade much more volume
compared to the first one because it's
trading much more volume in the in the
pre-market uh compared to the first one
and the the volume forecasting uh once
you develop a formula you will be able
to project how much volume that's going
to likely to trade throughout the entire
day compared to
the first one as well
so as a buyer the first thing you want
will be technical breakout second thing
you want will be volume as long as the
volume stays there there will be a
massive flow rotation throughout the
entire day that's where the stock
becomes really bullish and that's where
you can start your long positions so for
all beginners make sure pay attention to
the pre-market volume and also you can
use a predictive volume to calculate how
many times the flow is going to rotate
in that way it's going to benefit your
trading strategies and also uh it's
likely to grow your small account in a
much uh steady way so by the way we just
introduced our new platform and
starcraft will be have its own channel
where we will post the tutorial videos
for you guys
and the platform itself it's very easy
to use but you can also go into very
complicated series as well that's where
our lead trainer dantes will be
doing all the tutorials videos for you
guys so
now the end of this video thank you very
much for watching i will see you guys in
the next one

SOURCE VIDEO: What did I get from trading all the MEME stocks. Bitcoin, AMC, DOGE, GME [nuW8ny_dXck].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
hello guys dave duxer welcome to this
youtube videos today we're going to talk
about
some of the meme stocks that's been
happening for the last couple weeks
including gamestop amc
and dogecoin also uh bitcoin as well
so all the stickers has been trading
tons of volume and
also it's been hyped up by twitter or
reddit
and i want to talk about some of the
lessons that i learned
and also give away some of the method
and tips to you guys
so you guys can stay away from all these
unpredictable patterns
in the future so before i start this
video uh make sure to click the like
button and subscribe
and let's get started all right the
first thing i want to talk about will be
the initial run up
normally the initial run up doesn't have
any historical
resistance or any historical chart for
the ticker itself for something like gme
the ticker itself never ran up to 400
before the highest of the ticker has
ever been was forty dollars
so when you see that the stock is
getting stream volume and
hitting extreme price targets that's
where you have to stay away from the
stocks
because normally the more volume trades
on ticker the more competitive
it gets and the more competitive it gets
the more difficult for to trade and also
be able to make money on the first
initial run up
i have took a couple mistakes actually
trading on the front side
and i learned my lessons so what you
have to do is you have to wait for
uh the first initial run up to die out i
know that's a lot of
uh formal and also trading on the front
side gives you a lot of stresses as well
so personally i stay away from the
initial roundup
and always wait for the balances these
type of
hyped up tickers or meme stocks they
normally bounce back
three to four times so there's plenty of
opportunities for you to capitalize in
the future
and that's what i recommend for
beginners also for
experienced trader as well so the second
tip i want to give you guys is once you
look at the historical chart you can
clearly see where is the consolidations
where is the resistance and support you
can build a strategy
from that historical chart to actually
be profitable in the second round up
so on the first rung up you don't have
any reference or resistance for
the risk of and that you can only choose
to use intraday support and resistance
and that's normally really risky to do
as i said on the first point typical
tickers normally
round up about three to four times after
the initial run up
so they will tend to bounce three to
four times for you to capitalize
and for you to shore into these type of
bounces in the future
and after that it depends on the stock
fundamental itself
if the stock does have a decent
fundamentals it will actually slow grind
back and potentially
test the resistance in the future and
that's not until
a year or two so it's going to be a very
long time for the stock to recover
itself
after it's being hyped up for a
short-term gain
so the last point will be my personal
experience
as a trader that is whenever you are
making
mistakes on the front side you feel fomo
and you want to go in
and and eventually you took a loss
and you think about after the initial
run up
you know that the stock will bounce back
three to four times for you to
capitalize on the stocks
but you already made the first mistakes
to trading on the front side so the next
couple bounces you are basically
recovering your mistakes
and that doesn't feel very good as a
trader so you want to be
very disciplined and always stick to
your rules and
stick to your risk to be profitable and
i do know a lot of traders make the same
mistakes
they feel fomo and they go in and make
mistakes they want to recover
from the first mistakes and then they
make more mistakes after that
so the first run-up of a stock normally
are
very difficult to be profitable with so
overall by looking at my trading
performance
i did come out very profitable after all
those meme tickers
but also i did made several mistakes
that i can potentially avoid in the
future
so there's still a lot of mistakes for
me to improve for 2021 there's plenty of
volumes and there's plenty of
opportunities
so don't ever try to get the fear of
missing out
emotion and that's the number one
mistakes you should avoid
so that would be all for this video
thank you very much for watching i will
see you guys in the next one

SOURCE VIDEO: What do I do when there's no trade. (DUX Weekly Recap) [bQqsfz5JXNI].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up last even duck sir
welcome to our new YouTube videos of the
week so today we're gonna talk about
some rich app that the trades I did this
week there's no big trades recently this
week it's been really really slow and
I'm going to talk about how to really
filter out trades that you don't really
need and you only want to focus on the
right setups because some of the trades
that barely missed the criteria and some
of the trades that doesn't meet the
percentage of the criteria so those
trades you shouldn't be taking and if
you take those trades you're really
taking a lot of risk into those trades
so let me give some examples so Bo XL
was one of the trade that was a little
bit risky because with the stock didn't
really jump up that much it had no
bowing pre market and just started
parabolic into the four point one so the
stock didn't really have any percentage
until about four point one and there's
decent summer resistance in the four
dollar ish and I shorted in the I think
was in the three three cemani I covered
in when he broke four so that was a
really bad trade that I did took I did
some math on this one but wasn't that
big of a deal and I didn't retreat it
again because the bonds getting too
crowded so if the volumes start getting
more overwhelming in the previous volume
that day trade about 25 million the
state read about 15 million so it's
about 10 million volume or more today on
November 5th so if the violence start to
get really overwhelming I stay out of
those trades and wait until they show
the first rate day in this case bxl
wasn't really up that much that's why I
didn't shoot him after first rate day
but I just skipped it via Excel and one
for something else sometimes we can't
really find the resistances if it
reaches your maximum level of risk
Kairo losses it's worth it don't wait
and hope because some of it because some
of the parabolic can go straight and
Buster there is
and there's nothing you can do and
you're sitting there waiting for sad to
come down but it's way above your risk
and you're risking a lot more risk you
expected some of it sizing too much and
the ad on the way up and that's how they
blow up so I tend to stay away from
those mistakes if it reaches my max
level that I plan on this trade then the
straight cutter no hesitations and state
discipline in the market will always be
to the right decisions and help you stay
more rational the next three I'm gonna
talk was aBCL the stock went from 5 to
13 and you didn't really show any kind
of resistance and just straight down
trend from 13 to 4 and you can't really
find any consolidation resistance in
this day and shooting the six is not
very ideal because the risk range is way
too far the probably the only
consolidation resistance is probably at
10 ish but that wasn't enough resistance
shorting - so all the trades when a
parabolic and it's not a banker because
it doesn't have it doesn't have enough
volume that consolidating a certain
resistance zone let me show you example
rtmp was really similar chart by behaved
a lot different
because right around here you see stock
trading about five million then suddenly
a bond overwhelming and broke through
the resistance and came back down and I
broke the resistance again so all those
trades that didn't really have a certain
consolidation level it can be really
choppy and can't really find where
they're gonna top out if you can't find
we really gonna top out then you're
risking a large of range that can be
possibly reached and you can really
identify where your risk is so our CMB
was wrong examples that a VCO could
definitely
pull out if you got it not vomiting go
straight to 12 then you have an idea
where the stats go and you top out the
next thing is I'm gonna talk about
FNMA now turning around billion-dollar
market you have you know TCC market
doesn't really happen that often that's
why I don't trade that much I don't have
enough data on it but seems like that
stock got the top range of volume is
about 18 medians so the stocks going to
be top out really soon if you're
reaching those maximum volume in the
history I will be paying more attention
to it but there's decent resistance in
the 4 to 5 back in 2017 January so the
resistance the resistance is a little
bit too far it's almost a year so be
extra careful right now it's still
parabolic in it's still a little bit far
30% 40% from the fourth out over $5 ish
so they'll be more patient
we still got out a 3 4 or 5 days left I
will say I should definitely make a move
in next week
so this will be on top of watch into
next week and stock is not trading like
NASDAQ stocks
it doesn't really react that fast right
around here you get first read the
second rider and bounce right back and
you get a final panic
so typically Nasdaq can straight panic
after the second read day and very round
and drop about 70% into the $2 zone so
when you want to trade Evan ma sell a
terror risk for me I'm only aiming for
large volume that have really
consolidated and start to top out that's
where I'm aiming for butter than that I
would stay away from Fannie Mae
didn't trade that much this week
hopefully there's more opportunities
into next week and I'll be up thank you
very much and hope this video lessons
helps never see you guys next week

what's up guy Stephen duck sir welcome
to the new Buki recap and today we're
gonna focus on moronic curly shoes and
little bit more on the technical side
other than the beginner today we're
gonna talk about kto v IC e and c CL so
the curly issue is basically Volume II
issues when the bottom is not existing
and the stock is heading into either
resistance or support it doesn't really
matter if you've treated because nobody
was trading the stock because the
candles are moving back and forth based
on people buying and selling different
no people are buying and selling
he doesn't matter hit the supporters
marry hit the resistance it's not going
to move and sometimes you have liquidity
issues and you have a large manager
stuck in your one stock it's really
dangerous for you to get out or exit the
stop because you have so many shares you
will affect the stock price and there's
not enough bid or asked to execute your
shares then you're gonna get really bad
execution then you are basically taking
a loss for nothing this is what happens
on IAE people thinking okay the stock is
heading to resistance but there's not
actually volume existing on the stock
and people are still thinking about
shorting it some people get executed
really really bad and they waited for
all that started in crack because
there's no volume so that's something
you need to keep in mind if the stock
didn't spike on the day before and it's
losing volume then you can be a sharable
start but if the stock
begin with no spikes it just comes in
with no volume then you can't trade it
because the queries now kto be now this
is not a thing I want to talk about is
Nasdaq area because a lot of the tickers
when they're around 70 cents to $1 it is
a very dangerous area because the
company wants to hold their stock above
1 if the stock is now above 1 they don't
meet the nice the criteria and the
our risk indicator didn't state they
want to try their best to hold the stock
above one and when start spikes to 1.35
and they automatically assume there's
going to be a lot of manipulation going
on and trying to hold the stock above
one so it's trying to struggle in this
one point or nine area if you keep
shorting then you won't do anything for
you because the stock is above one for a
while it's really hard to shorten to gap
up barely over one stocks that is the
reason I don't touch all those if
they're crowded the barely over one it's
not even my price range that's why I
don't touch all those between 0.8 to 1.5
this kind of range tickers season CL
this is the ticker that happened of soon
Wednesday and the stock was very very
proud I think he trades around 20
million shares on that day 16 million
shares
yeah so for stock trading 60 million
shares and their flows 1 million
actually about 16 times of his parole
and 6 times of the floor rotation all
the stickers will get super crowded when
low flow gets crowded when they're
trading between maximum of rotations
they can be either very very bullish or
very bearish now it means two words to
bullish sectors than the bearish because
if there's no major momentum breakdown
the stock is likely to stay bullish when
there are flow rotating for 16 20 times
and also the reason why I don't under
either ccel because if you look at the
yesterday support Mass consolidation at
1.5 to 1.6 area when the stock break its
momentum falls into that support bounce
right back to the day high first if you
are shorting to the breakdowns you are
shooting into your support it's very
dangerous because there's support
momentum breakdown
and the bullish factors and the birth
factors are conflicting each other and
especially on low flow when are
conflicting you cannot short them that's
exactly how the SAP bounce backs with
the shorts again then throw fade in the
afternoon so that's why I always stay
away from low flow that trades ten times
of its flow rotation on that day and I
will much likely to wait until the next
day to either short it or go along
because with massive amount of flow
rotation it's pretty much unpredictable
for macro flows under two million also I
wanna go over one of the questions that
people ask me or not how do you when the
stock performs a fake out and you get
faked out and the stock goes into your
ways that you were expected would you
chase or no the answer is no because
when the stock messed you up at once and
the second time you want to go in you
are more likely to be emotional and when
you're emotional you cannot trade the
stocks you have to always stay rational
when you make one mistakes on stock I'd
never trade it again I just skip it and
there's opportunities comes in in the
market as always I always focus on the
perfect setups I wanna give my risk
management right I wanna keep my risk
within 10% of my entire positions and I
won't get my risk reward of 1 to 4 or 1
to 2 in normal or 1 to 4 that's the best
if the stock doesn't meet a single
criteria out of 10 criteria
I don't trade it now on entre I only
trade the best criteria that is how you
can stay consistent profitable because
people are trading something that
they're not comfortable with and they're
testing strategies or they messed up at
once and they won't go in the second
time being emotional and messed up again
then just keeps the chain reaction you
want to always stay a fresh when you
messed up one just move on to the next
because this
is not married to one starter macness is
not married to one stuck in trading
Amazon's or trading trading all those
big market tap in penny stocks tickers
comes in every single day different
takers different situations and you can
always grab a lot of opportunities so
now be the weekly recap for this week
hopefully you guys had a great new year
and I will see you guys next week

[Music]
what's up guys team induction today I'm
gonna go over some of my thought process
on CBS I and some of the tickers that
happened
SSC happened yesterday so I had a very
very good Monday made about 110k I will
verify those two trades later this week
but you can see my screenshot on Twitter
so it's getting to the top houses on SSC
so on this ticker you did had a really
good news expect a lot about 120% in a
pre market and this is a very classic
bounce short if you took a look at the
long term chart notice about decent
resistance right around this $5 area so
once they opened and I didn't see any
strains of pushing because you tempted I
have 800 volume tempted to push and
didn't come over another push didn't
come over and just fade back all the way
to the three daughters so I took half of
my positions into this open area because
first it's about short second in meet
the criteria it needs to be meet it's
not a super low flow it's a relatively
big flow third of that love booty
weakness that's why I entered and I
covered in the I think asinus returns
and the last 10k shares are covering the
330 is I didn't wait on to end of the
day because I was trying to catch a plan
so I could make extra extra VJ right
around here but I didn't and I was
looking for a bounce to shorinji today
but I didn't give anything so I just set
it out on CBS I he was I wouldn't say a
pump or just say a hype massive higher
the stock doesn't went from like 30
cents to $9 and dropped from 93 dollars
in one day so people keep
telling me this is this stuff has the
fundamental in there if if it's a real
stuck stuck doesn't drop 60% of its high
in one day it's gonna be some deep
buyers I'm looking to swing to short
this on for further bounce attempted to
shorting the 528 and trying to look for
that $5 around crack turns I didn't hold
it really really good pushed to 580 and
faded back to $5 again and that factor
holds really well so if I don't see that
I've got a crack I wouldn't be shorting
so keep that in mind so now let's go
over the top process quite short raid
yesterday so when I see the stock is
cracking the mid day I see it cracks
this 8 and start going into this 750 and
I say okay the stock and you can see
consistently red candle cracking the mid
day and you don't see any support
anywhere from the previous chart so the
only King don't you can see one it's
probably that this 450 area and that's a
long way from 7-8 dollars and just this
slow grinding without any support
so I attempted to short in the 760 got
executed around 7:20 ish I think was
40,000 shares or 40,000 shares and I
covered into I think was the five ish
and I did really bad I covered at the
department five Tony ish and we'll just
start balancing I was in the airport so
I don't want to get too much stress I
did kind of what adding six to eight
years and I like you know adding to it
and you fades back and cover rest of my
shares in 520 so that's about it and if
I could add back to my origin original
sizing 680 area I didn't take all these
profits from 53.6 that can make two
hundred thousand on this one specific
play but turns out to be didn't catch
entire drop catch portion of it I'll be
looking for the bounce into tomorrow
hopefully can give me a decent chance
recently the market it's not that high
every single spike just keeps getting
destroyed and and they don't host back
that well so just be careful if you
don't see any good news and always wait
for five minutes once the market is open
because if you're getting at the market
open you typically lose because in most
of the game if you're the one making the
first move we will most likely do it
again in this type of industry so just
be patient you have to be patient to
wait for the right opportunity ready for
the right criteria so if the stock it's
not meeting the right criteria you just
have to keep waiting so people just
doesn't have any kind of idea of what is
patient patient is to wait until the
right timing to the stock meets the
specific criteria to be able to make a
judgment call but if you don't have that
specific criteria in your head no matter
how patient you are either you get in
too early either you're getting too late
or you miss the play so you have to set
that criteria you got to know what's the
pattern then you can be patient to wait
for that pattern to appear then you can
make tons of money on your patients so
that's what patience means to me and I
have traded about almost three years now
now exactly three years but the only way
to be consistent in this industry is to
be patient and and for that one specific
winning percentage pattern then you will
be good to go but if you over trade and
you break the discipline of being
patient then you will just be on that
losing streak until you figured out what
patience is and that'll be the lessons
for today thank you very much and guys
have a great day

================================================

hello guys steven dexter today we're
going to talk about what's the reason
behind
trading between 9 to 11 is the most
profitable
time zone so uh before i get into this
video make sure to click the like button
and subscribe
it's going to help us pulling out more
free videos so the first thing
you want to split day trading into three
different time zones that's personally
what i did
at the very beginning of my career so 9
to 11
11 to 2 and 2 to 4. those are three
different time zones that represents
different strategies 9 to 11 normally
represent
intraday trades so let's say you want to
shore into a bank shore you want to buy
into
a pullback into a multi-breakout those
are specifically designed for intraday
trades
then 11 to 2 time zone it's called
midday
now normally midday trades doesn't
really stay consistent profitable
now they do work seasonally so i do not
recommend for beginners or people who
are trading
for a long time to get into that time
zone because midday trades are very
unpredictable
according to the five years of
statistics
now the last time zone i want to talk
about will be two to four
two to four is called the late day
trades now those trades do
stay consistent profitable depends on
what type of pattern you're trading
let's say you wanna short into a
momentum shift
trades and you wanna build a massive
swing short
to hold over nine and potentially hold
for one to two weeks
and that is very ideal building
a position late day momentum shift
normally comes after 2 30.
some of the injury traits does happen
between two to four
that's when stocks is trading mass
amount of volume which i talked about
earlier in the youtube videos uh it's
called the buying sufficiency if you
haven't checked it out
buyers efficiency first threat day
momentum shift
and potentially building a massive
screenshot those are the four patterns
you can use
when you are trading in between two to
four now most of my trades
are placed between 10 30 to 10
45 i do see a lot of beginners tend to
make
mistakes they want to place a trade as
soon as possible
after the market open that's the
mistakes i made early in my career
as well people are too eager or
too rushed into a trade at end of the
day they will end up taking
loss because they don't really know the
volatility and the potential spiking
percentage
after the market open the reason why i
place the trades
around 10 30 to 10 45 is because i want
the chart to start forming a pattern
that i can recognize
and also is trading sufficient enough
volume that tiny little bit volume will
not
change the stock price dramatically so
let's say during the pre-market there is
no volume was trading before
9 30. all of the sudden after market
open the stock is trading
5 million 4 million 10 million volume
but i cannot
estimate how much volume is going to
trade throughout the entire day
because i only have that small time
range
of reference but ninety percent of the
time
when you are looking into the pre-market
volume you can kind of estimate how much
fun is going to trade throughout the
entire day
ninety percent of the time you can
calculate how much volume
is going to trade throughout the entire
day so you can kind of know that the
stock is going to get crowded
or not if the stock is very crowded that
means the stock has a really high
computation after market open
so it's really difficult to get a very
good entry
if the stock is crowded in average you
kind of have to wait
between 30 to 45 minutes after the
market open
trading about anywhere between 40
million to 50 million volume
and potentially develop a consolidation
that's where you should sizing in as a
shorting positions
for long positions you still have to
wait for 30 minutes to 45 minutes
because people tend to chase into the
breakout after market
open then the stock rejects them make
them
to sell into a dip that's where you take
the opportunities
to size into a potential breakout so
those are the reasons why you should
choose
to trade between 9-11 and that should
give you
a very consistent trading performance
and also
doesn't take the whole day so you don't
have to sit in front of computers for
eight hours
and watch the chart to develop and that
will be end of this video thank you very
much for watching i'll see you guys in
the next time

Plus that negative 14k I was right about
what's the best inductor welcome to my
new video lessons of the week and today
I'm going to talk about some trades that
I made last week sometimes I made today
and the thought process for tomorrow's
lunch so the major trades I'm going to
talk about will be a bi oh and a double
X a PIL I think I made around 40,000 um
a double X I made around 51,000 so last
week my profit was right around the
100,000 those are considered to be
really really big profits for me and
every time when I make a big trade my
ego gets too big then I start all over
trading I think I'm Monday lost about
14,000 and that quickly realized their
mistakes and they stopped over trading
and today and make some decent profit on
CBS I so that's getting to the top
process for a PIL
and a double X so a PIL I think I sure
did better around seven seventy and a
cupboard into 520 I think Albert was
right around 520 made about 28% and I
see this a momentum shift where I run
this $8 ish and when substrates that
many times and only has around 1 million
flow the flow becomes insufficient when
it drops it doesn't take that many
shares to drop so this is I think I
talked about this as in the last video
and let's not go over that much so to
take before yesterday I was shorting a
Baroness I think was in seventh when
there's major momentum shifted and into
this afternoon perk I feel a little bit
because they might be turned out into
your next bill okay so I don't want to
risk too much in common losses and then
massive dump into the clothes in the
next day had the offering and a missed
opportunity should have over hold
overnight I had I think ten up eight
thousand shares and I missed this
incredible opportunities yesterday so
that was a bad trade I think I took a
decent loss August 13th I think I
shorting them open because I saw there's
a massive resistance at 770 and I think
680 is now very far from 770 and I want
to use this a pretty market high as my
risk so turns out he broke this pretty
market high and went all the way to on a
25 and broke it didn't broke the past
couple days resistance but I tested
twice so I took a loss in this breakout
and I very short it in a 7 when there's
massive momentum shifted covered into
720 again because it looks like he's
gone perc again and took out this 720
back nothing so I was scared
started over trading and covered into
strength took a loss then he dumped I
don't want to be short it again because
I want to stop over trading 90 next day
dumped tired e2 burly began at 4:40 so
didn't take the profits
took my loss and I will be traded and
that is mindful I didn't really think
about the entry I was too focused on the
pattern because if you have a bad entry
and in stock goes against you even is in
the pattern you are done if you are down
15-20 percent your position you're too
nervous and you were start getting
emotional once you start getting motion
now we start over trading so there's two
factors that it's really important in
trading first you have to focus on the
pattern while pattern your trading
because some parents have specific
winning percentage now the second is is
your entry is your risk management
if it's not perfect pattern can easily
shake you out and you can shakes you out
you want to make your money back if you
wanna make your money back you started
making stupid decisions again so that is
the key factor to avoid and I do know a
lot of my students a lot of people are
making those mistakes so please be
careful when you have a really good odds
pattern you have to get your entry right
get your risk management right because
if you don't have both of those things
at the same time you go to lose money so
that is my style process for a pil day
before yesterday and on this month plus
that negative 14 all those red around
plus 70 case 80 th and I will take my
decent profit next time I'll be more
focused on my entry instead of patterns
because I focus on pattern too much and
that's where you start to get big losses
right after a big and so it's my
mistakes
and I hope you guys never from my
mistakes and let's get into today's OTC
patterns so CVS I but from moon II think
I was right around beginning was on 40
cents to $5 and yes he went up a lot and
it's a huge market cap so those market
cap are typically bigger than the market
but I used to trade I took a short into
the 550 risking the greenish and dumped
all the way to 450 and there's huge
buyers again and again so I covering the
four 70ish now OTC is you don't want to
covering a strength because when you're
covered it takes too long to cover and
if it takes too long you're sometimes
you cover 30 cents more where you want
to cover so in this case once they
bounce through that 4.80 because you
crack this 4.80 previously and you did
stop bounce back right through four
point attack nothing you have to cover
it because
450 becomes a support and already
becomes
again so if you want to reassure into
the for money and $5 again and there's
going to be to support 480 and 450 and
it's gonna be really hard to crack so
that's why covering the 470 right around
right before goes over it down 4.8
resistance so that is a really important
message if the market cap is too big
like 500 million then you have to cover
and there's actually a fundamental
behind the CBS eye because the marijuana
stocks and marijuana getting legalized
and they start having I think last
quarter was 1201 median so that's
already decent none of earning so
typically on those OTC stocks look like
a pump charge if they do have a
fundamental and if they have a large cab
just make sure take your profits really
quickly because they don't drop that
quick they're not pump and dump and the
holder gives really really well so
that's one thing you need to be chiral
and that will be it for today thank you
very much and you guys have a great day

SOURCE VIDEO: What would happen if there's $0 commission in trading？ [xnmY3jA5gZ8].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys Steven Dexter so lot of
people have asked me what is my opinion
zero dollar commissions um Interactive
Brokers
and you trade so those two things are
the biggest brokers in the industry here
I'm gonna give you some opinions about
it it's gonna be very interesting before
getting to topic I'm giving now a
two-week birthday sells had to do you
don't give sales so if you're interested
in my guide or interested how to really
trade in the stock market and the basics
and stuff I'll be putting the
discounting for the trading guide so
make sure to check it out and it's
getting into today's topic so number
things I think about zero dollar
Commission's is a lot of people are
thinking about okay well it's ready to
go into the training world and I can
just place whatever trade I want without
having any type of commissions it's
going to cause a lot of confusions as
well is because people think like that
but actually it's not so first people
will trade a lot more than before
because there's zero commissions you can
test whatever strategy they want and it
will cause a higher ECCN fees that means
they're still do pay fees with trading
but it's not about actual commissions so
you will still have to pay a little bit
money to overall commissions number two
in penny stock area specifically so
typically putting stock are really
really cheap and the way that I
experienced in trading world is when I
trade opinion size which is sub pennies
and I usually don't trade that right now
I don't really treat it anymore but when
I experienced it when I trading 80s in
stocks or a 50 cent stock I tend to
trade a lot of shares than before it's
because I'd say well I'll implode a
$50,000 as my position and if the stock
is about let's say $5 then I only need
to another insures if I trade back and
forth this it it's a buy and sell so I
trade about 20,000 shares in total
now let's follow with 50 cent stocks now
right now it's because if I have a fifty
thousand dollar position and have 50
cents as a stock price which means I
need a hundred thousand shares to buy
and sell now but end of the day I would
need to buy sell
overall it will be 200,000 shares that's
causing a really chunk out of profit if
I made a profit of this stock if I if I
lose on this specific it starts then I
will be charging more a service for
thousand on the position I'm ticker than
add another four thousand into the
ticker which is eight thousand in total
asked including Commission's without
that much Commission's and we're getting
rid of Commission concerns then a lot of
people is going to get into the paint
starts and let's dive into statistics
again general traders losses within two
years and 90% 80% traders losing so
people were likely to trade more when
the policies generally opened for people
in October 8th October 9th which will
cause a lot more volume for instant
market which means in my strategy wise
it will cause more that voters diodes
means when they are holding a stock and
they would never want to come out is
because if they decide to come out the
stock they will be taking like 70% 80%
of their position lost for retail
traders I don't think is very healthy
this because if you have a 3/4 retail
traders I don't think it's very healthy
it's because if the retail people that
wants to get into the stock market and
they think all there's no Commission's
anymore out likely to trade more and you
pinion stock area will cost more bag
holders cause more volume that means
they're likely to lose money and they
will bring better odds for short sellers
experienced short sellers next thing
when I talk about Alko trading system
algos is people who are writing a
program and they're putting into a stock
market and they're basically generating
traits for them and that's a big
actually that's a really big news for
them is because they can reduce all that
commissions out of the way because when
people are making millions and millions
trades per day they're putting a lot of
commissions well yeah if our people are
paying average lower commissions
compared to other retail traders because
typically they have a relationship with
the brokerage you would have a better
way to find better brokerage
so in this way they completely don't pay
any more commissions anymore so with a
low trading system same thing a lot of
people are losing money because they
can't fighting the computer trading
system are basically competing on
emotional so overall I think the stock
market will pretty much stay the same
stay usual I think there will be a large
surge of volume after this policy came
out for a short period of time and I
think a lot of retail trader is going to
lose money
you don't do their research if you go to
get in the stock market and you look at
it as a zero Commission do not get in
before do a research and another thing I
want to talk about last thing is the
Robin Hood now a lot of people recommend
a Robin Hood starting free and it's
actually not free because of the Robin
Hood trading style liquidity and they
are basically taking little bit sense I
wanted buy a little bit since I asked
them which means let's say you bought at
one daughter and there will probably
execute how you bought at one point a
one 1.02
then when you want to sell at two and we
will execute the trade as a 1.99 1.98
they're taking your profits by making
this the Robin Hood app for free so I
think that's really really bad for your
internet exit it's because when you have
a bigger position that means they're
taking a bigger chunk of the profits so
that's why when I have a bigger position
or a bigger size I like to choose other
brokerage that basically charge me a
certain amount of permissions that
doesn't really take my profits from the
original positions so that's my opinion
about a trade entirely broker and Robin
Hood hopefully you guys enjoy this make
sure / so make sure I hit the like
button and leave a comment below of your
questions about this videos or have any
other questions about other brokerage
and also leave a topic of what I wanna
do for annex youtube video thank you
very much I will see you guys next time

hello guys stephen here welcome to this
video so in this video is going to be a
little bit different
i'm going to share you some of my
training journeys and
how they will move forward with this
channel so i started this channel back
in 2016
after a year i was being profitable in
the trading industry
for the last two to three years we have
done tons of videos
about risk management different tickers
and recaps
and some of the trading mentalities that
you should have you can slowly see that
my profit is going from
700 000 a year to 1.5 million to 2
million to 3 million
then to 5 and 10 million last year and
as you know that in the last two years
we have gone through a lot of activities
especially in trading that there's gme
tons of tickers going up
two to three hundred percent on a day so
i was being really
busy about adapting to the market and
how do i
improve my trading performance overall
so
haven't given too much of thought
process into the youtube videos
as i'm getting better in trading all of
the basic information that i learned as
a beginner
doesn't seem very important it feels
like to me that i'm
trying to cover the basic informations
that's
not very good for beginners i don't know
if that makes sense
so going into the future if you guys
have any topics for me to cover
please leave a comment below i know
we're not very active on the replying
the comments part
but i do read every single one of your
guys's comments
if you have any detailed more of a
beginner topic
or more advanced topic as well
especially in this penny stock sector
or micro cap sectors you can leave a
comment below
and i will select probably most of them
that's attractive for beginners and also
that's benefiting for the entire
community i would definitely
do a video for that so other than that
well hopefully you guys are staying
profitable and
make sure as we always talked about in
every single video
that nerdfighteria mistakes be willing
to face your mistakes
and try to improve your from your
mistakes that's how you get better
thank you very much for watching i will
see you guys in the next one

what's up guys - inductors so this video
is very dedicated that you thank you
guys for supporting me to 100k
subscribers we'll be giving out a lot of
trading because a lot of you are asking
for it so the live webinar will become
pretty free and just make sure subscribe
to our email list and we'll be sending
out an email give you a link to click
and what they will be on so click the
link below and the LaBarbera will
probably around next week or maybe next
next week I'll try to get the dates next
week so maybe we can catch a lot of
trade or I can't answer you get some
questions
our Christmas sales going on starting
from now make sure grabber conference
tickets our DVD guides everything's on
sale we should grab a chance and this
get into today's topic so the most to
frequent question I get asked is how's
it be like to be him from a college
student to make a multi million dollars
per year what's the minimum dollar to
start before jumping into the stock
industry and today I'm gonna go over to
all those two questions and what did I
gain what they were sacrificed so let's
get back from the very beginning so back
in about 3 to 4 years ago I was majoring
in environmental engineering and
chemical engineering so I was taking
about 17 credit hours per semester also
working at a night shift English who
war-torn so basically I have to work
about 6 hours a day well five days a
week and from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. and make
about $50 per night and depends about
the nights I make anywhere between 300
to 400 per day no I make 300 to 400 per
week so I was using not about money to
save as much as I can and I really want
to get out of that well college life
because my sleep schedules all screwed
up and I do not want living the same
life that for the rest of four years
before I graduate so I started looking
into different industries to looking
into what type of investment can do to
really aggressively grow my accounts I
looked up into really start looked about
in stock market and up for real estate
you need a good credit well first second
you have to be able to communicate at
that time i english was pretty bad right
now still bad but better than before so
i couldn't really communicate that well
be
where I make the deal happen so I got
rid of that so for SAP market I want
something that only based on technical
analysis instead of fundamental because
I do not want to read the whole type of
you know long documents to figure out
which one I should really be able to
invest event wait for five years and ten
years and to make it grow fifty percent
100 percent because it's not really
aggressive recorder account I'll do it
for so long I want something that I can
put time into it looking for aggressive
short-term investment so I jumped into
this thing called a penny stock or micro
cap stocks whatever you want to call it
I typically trade stocks at under five
dollars sometimes I trade around 10 20
or sometimes 70 so it's not really in
that same industry because mid cap or
arch Chow I trade pretty much of and
just depends on the frequency how many
times I place a trade on different
market cap zones initially I started to
trade ETFs that's my first approach to
the stock market then now started
looking for daily averages what if the
stock have a average going up and down
rate every single day let's say the
stock maximum gain will be 15 percent
maximum Alice's would be 15% because ETF
is not like printing so we are not going
to drop to zero so there's gonna be
average bouncing back and forth to rate
now every time it goes off the rate
let's say today you went up 20% that
means it's going 5% above the average
okay I'm gonna go against it which means
I'm going to short it because he's
bouncing off the daily range now let's
say today lost 50% day I'm going to buy
it well today lost about 20% names
5% of the daily range which means I'm
going to buy and that worked out really
well and that did try to trade that
above method forward almost two months
and made a thousand bucks just by using
the technical analysis and also lost a
thousand but based on my emotions at the
beginning I do not really know how to
really control my emotion because when I
lose money I don't really think
rationally I think about what I'll need
to make this money back because it just
lost it today if I make it back I feel
better I want to stay green every single
day but it's not possible for a stock
market you have to wait for opportunity
comes to you but that time I do not
understand that type of wall psychology
of how to really supposed to trade the
market I lasted nine thousand bucks and
they carted pretty much even now think
about what I should change my method
into probably different industry or you
know I made the mistakes and I know how
I made the mistakes and I was looking
for more aggressive gains instead of
picking thousand bucks in two month and
losing the other blocks in tomorrow so I
jumped into as you guys know micro cap
stocks or mid cap stocks
now my first proach will be a little bit
different because I want to know okay
what's the general statistics for all
those pending stocks that's out there
because hanging socks in out like ETFs
they can drop a hundred percent in your
day they can gain a thousand were
sitting out there you never know it's
not settled bouncing range because ETFs
never just straight drop to zero and
getting about 100 percent a day that's
very very rare now for pending stocks
it's pretty much everywhere it you never
notice I was going to hop a thousand
percent to that are singing a day and
you don't know which stock you don't
know how is supposed to make the action
and I don't have a general statistics so
at that time I was a very motivated to
get off out of the you know the college
life and they start tracking massive
statistics everywhere any type of
tickers that involves full market cap
and volatility so I was tracking every
tickers that was going up 20 percent 50
percent 100 percent and no track in two
different time zones so 9 to 11 11 to 2
2 to 4 because now I found out 9 to 11
to behind to or for those two time zones
are most active time zone now when I
want to pick the most efficient timing
for my cabs or mid-cap stocks it's in
here between 9:30 to 10:30 so the first
an hour over the market open it's where
you can make the most money
now not all people are thinking about
what we should go full time for trading
stocks the answer is you don't
I trade pretty much part-time now I
spend about first an hour to trade and
also for now I teach people how to trade
in a live webinar and sometimes it gets
busy then I have
to sale for all day but most of the time
45 minutes to an hour is what you should
spend just to trade my recap sales
remain cap stocks you do not need to
spend a long time sitting in a chair and
do nothing
so how do you become ended if you want
to just jump into this industry always
start part-time and use the part-time as
a revenge to be able to more tracks
artistics learn the fundamentals during
technical analysis during the patterns
and all that and that's I think it's one
of the most important suggestions that
would suggest for a beginner to do that
so a lot of people also ask me what did
you sacrifice on your college life well
so basically I spend about 10 hours a
day 10 hours a day 365 days pretty much
no break and how did that still don't
take breaks and there was an earning
patterns drawing pictures on the wall
putting them on the wall and looking my
Celso psychopathic because people think
else with Jake crazy about learning
stocks and after a year and a half I
build my edge if you'll my statistics
that build my database and start really
profiting so initially I only have about
one or two patters I was already
profiting massively they're adding more
patterns I was pretty much getting to I
think the maximum of you can profit from
article caps were mid cap stocks just
using my capital so in conclusion I
pretty much sacrifice all the party life
also lack of study time for school as
well and that's a very important thing
as well I'll use my class time to study
use shower time to study use cooking
time to study using pretty much every
time you can get listening Bluetooth in
the car trying to study for the market
so everything takes practice it's like a
sports you don't become the pearl this
sports or become you later sports it
takes years to get there if you want to
speed it up do you just have to practice
more I just have to know more and you
know learn from other people and all the
general practice buy your own because
the best thing can earn is trying
yourself and from other people mistakes
now the method of ha studied is I pulled
out every single big traders and
mistakes and they started to analysis
how they really made the mistakes and
how what they're thinking before they
make the mistakes
number one number two using that based
on your own build statistics to really
generate an edge and how your pattern
can avoid all those big mistakes that
they made just to make sure they don't
happen on you before jumping into this
industry you can study my mistakes you
can study other people mistakes and pull
them out together try to go back to the
time that before they made the trade and
what they're thinking what's your plan
trying to simulate the same situation
again that's one of the big factors that
I used to study after that I started
making nine hundred thousand million per
year or two million per year and three
million per year over well people think
money can change a person I don't think
he changed me so you have the freedom to
buy whatever you want let's say I love
cars and about cars the get tired of
them eventually by the end of the day
it's where your passion is like what do
you want for your life and their love
trading I will keep trading for most of
my life and I love cars I would probably
buy cars and just to have fun with them
and a lot pretty videogames I still play
video games today I think one of the
most important lessons that stock market
really teaches you how to become a
humper person because whenever you get a
big ego the stock market will instant
shot you down and I think you hear this
before your biggest losses come from
your biggest game right after a biggest
game because when you have a biggest one
you are having so much equal you wanna
make more money and you're thinking
about bigger futures that's where you
lose your guard and like one of the
trick really catches you off guard
that's where you make the huge mistakes
and I did that multiple times pretty
much up still doing it right now when
you are in the market well I'm talking
about just you're a trader a retail
trader you have to stay as humble as
possible pretty much in every aspect of
your life so next thing I'll talk about
is a lot of people asking what's the
minimum minimum minimum money to really
well start off as I said you don't have
to start trade right away you're gonna
start with a few hundred bucks
lotta brokers don't really accept really
low capitals you need at least about
3,000 just start asking
that I know for short selling and for
cooling lawn can start whatever you want
you can start with $300 you can start
with $200 or whatever you want to do and
a lot of people are also asking a lot of
courses are very expensive out there so
my personal personal experience I spent
about initially twenty thousand just by
purchasing all the courses out there
online and trying to pick up as much
knowledge as possible some of them just
wasted some of them just so much both
there's so much Rambo some of it
well it's good and you are going to
waste money on all those different
courses out there and as you can hear
about me talking about it is I don't
really like that I don't like rainbows I
just go straight to the point in my
perspective a lot of people know this
the more you learn the less mistakes you
make and a lot of people just want to
jump into this industry and it's
expecting making twenty thousand fifty
thousand a hundred thousand right away
because sometimes people that think like
that you will get lucky pretty much the
first time or second time but you won't
get lucky in a long term the mistakes
that cost you will cause way much time
what do you have learned from if you
didn't try to learn as much as possible
you don't internet in the books or
whatever courses again and that's the
reason why the beginning I don't really
mind that's been that much money on it
but some of the courses out there are
completely 100% of the post oh so that's
the most two important things I want

SOURCE VIDEO: What's my morning routine before trading？ [YFBkSqxcT98].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
let some guys conductor so a lot of
things I'm asking me what's my morning
routine and what do I look for I think a
lot of basic questions here and there so
today I'm gonna go over all those
questions altogether and before I get in
this video make sure to click the like
button and subscribe we're gonna have a
lot of more Gainor upcoming videos so
stay tuned and also statistics 1 or 2 is
coming as well and I know a lot of
people are asking so it's going to be
the next video or two and and that's
giving and let's get into today's video
so generally I wake up around 9 o'clock
and they look for socks that on the top
person gainer top person gainer can
typically find on every single platform
either have a trade equity feed
interactive broker all types of
brokerage have their own bathroom you
can use all platform to scan over or
Nasdaq market and YC may be OTC market
as well typically I don't really scan
for OTC market because the violence
super-long what I'm typically looking
for is a very high volatile pre market
action so one of the skin and I have is
the volume has to be over 100k that's
number one number two it has to be over
20% if it's not over 20% then I just
automatically filtered away also a lot
of people are asking do I look at most
wall tickers that goes down a lot let's
say top losers and negative fifty
percent 60 percent I generally don't
really look at that because when the
stock is dropping 50 60 % it's scaring
people and when people aren't scared
they don't want to rebuy the day up
anymore
and especially with that type of stocks
you know the stock doesn't really get a
lot of volume so there's no volatility
after market open generally most of the
time about 80 percent of time they don't
really get that much volume unless
there's some type of news going on which
is the 20% of the chance that happen so
once I find the taker I want to trade
I'm interested which is 1 over 100k over
20% in the premium market then we look
for anywhere to flow to market caps
which it's a little bit difficult for
beginners to decide where you should
trade and where what ticker you should
pick as a priority so I'm gonna give you
very simple selections for you if you're
just beginning to try painting stocks so
we are adjourned
in the market you are looking at smoke
at me cap and ArchiCAD which isn't
building our cat now most of the
patterns that we created which I
mentioned a couple videos before will be
first-rate day overstaying gap down or
bow short gap up shore all those type of
tickers and there the patterns are all
generated from the small cap statistics
now some of them they're mid caps but
none of them are in a large cap and so
when you are seeing a large amount of
I'm pouring the pre-market into a
billion dollar cap which is going to be
very difficult to really manipulate the
pattern into these type of market caps
because it is unlikely to work we track
samples that based on small caps so
that's why certain patterns works in
small caps certain pairs or sparing the
mid cap and you can sometimes dip by
works with grating large caps so when
you are a beginner and you're looking
for long strategies because you have
really small towns and that you have a
cash account a lot of people are
underaged so they're not feeling the
requirement to open up a brokerage
account with margin and highly suggest
that we have a cash account tends to
trade the market a little bit higher
which is over 500 million so one of the
pattern you're looking for which I
mention in the previous video you're
looking for large panic into these type
of large cap 30 to 40 percent sometimes
50 percent the chance of them balancing
will be over 80 percent so that is very
great strategy for small count to start
very small and slowly grow into 20,000
30,000 so a lot a lot of people asking
me what do I really look at SEC filings
do I really look at the news how do I
really value the fundamental side so
when I typically trading penny stocks
not opening stuff doesn't really have a
fundamental those are really trashy
companies that are looking for money
from the investors so the company will
either issuing warrants your offering
and make their stock swap to you under
one dollar and it would just do an early
bird spread one to fifty and make that
October 1 dollar again to really meet
the Nasdaq requirements once they do
that they can do it again and again and
again because when they're doing reverse
split and it will reduce the flow to a
really small amount which it's a very
interested market for market makers if I
really want to pump the stock and you
can
hi everybody pump the stock as well
since since the flow is really small if
there's a super high volume which is
high demand compared with a low supply
then the price is likely to go up and
once they go up and the current you are
offering again so when you are trying to
trade all those small caps you know long
term especially trying to hold them for
long term never do that invest into
something better
smoke caps only for intraday trading and
for you guys have a small count or have
a cash account if you can't sure and
you're looking for the bias sockets sub
pennies and you're looking to hope for a
long wrong then you know non terms
aren't likely to work also one of the
most asked questions did I really read
any trading books and I'm gonna give you
this straight out well most of my
trading experience come from the screen
time I spend countless amount of hours
researching statistics looking at the
patterns new named elbow twos and it's
all learning in front of computer and
books doesn't really teach you that much
detailed stuff and all those high
winning percentage patterns are whether
you discover by yourself you can learn
the concepts from others but all those
details have to figure out ourselves and
you very super beginner then it can be
something like stop for dummies and for
more advanced traders you can read like
Momo trader that which is pretty good
how do we come in there the psychology
of trading teach you the psychology of
how to really think about what other
people are thinking to build a counter
strategy those are general books I
typically read so that's gonna be the
end of the video if you don't learn more
about general statistics and more
strategies we're hosting a conference in
Yuma here in Newark right now it's our

SOURCE VIDEO: What's the Realistic Return from Trading a Small Account？ [thwU1bqz238].en.vtt
================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
lots of guys doing that sir so today we
are going to talk about very interesting
they cannot people are asking me well
you have a small champion or surely
people have small count and the countess
will be under ten thousand three
thousand to five thousand within our
range and what's the maximum profit can
make within a year and then how long is
going to take me to get to you know
bigger counts as fifty thousand two
thousand maybe get over the PDT rules
today I'm going to give you some
simulations and give you some realistic
numbers for you to understand like how
long it's going to take you to really
get to that point
so before I start the simulation in this
video make sure to click the like button
and subscribe and also all those
patterns and strategies I'm talking
about he needs to be extremely
disciplined if you are breaking run
rules or you're feeling tired and that
day I would suggest not to try it
because it doesn't really mean you're
the best performances before you follow
the rules and the instruction of this
video picture stay extremely disciplined
and that's the one of the most important
thing for you to achieve consistently
profitable first let's start with the
count set so let's start with the
minimum account to trade three thousand
dollars now how much am I willing to
risk how much am I willing to profit if
ever two thousand dollar account
I will have about 1000 maybe $700 pull
out for each trade and for each trade
how well into profit maybe 20 percent to
15 percent per trade so that means three
thousand dollar count with 20% or 30%
account size will be a thousand a
thousand profit from 20 percent to 15
percent will be 200 to 150 bucks per
trader now let's go into the frequency
of the pattern now each year we have
about 100 trades overall and let's say
you're not perfect and you can only
catch about 50% of all those trades so
50 trade
times 200 or 150 you can profit about
$10,000 within a year now we haven't
come into the slowly snow bulb because
we're account size is growing and you're
building your capitals and once you get
to seven thousand six thousand you can
risk more on each trader so let's say
six thousand and 20% or 30% you can risk
about 1,800 to 1200 per trade and your
profit will be pretty much doubled
you know how much you are profiting from
3,000 so it sure will be profiting about
300 250 since we haven't count into the
snowball action and we can add extra 100
percent from the original profit from
that 50 per trade so ten thousand plus
ten thousand that's twenty thousand
that's about twenty thousand dollars per
year of three thousand dollar account so
there's two other factors we've
encountered in now number one will be
out of this 50 trade how many you're
going to screw up with all those 50
trade if what's the winning percent off
the trailer
let's say the pattern and the average
has about 70 percent of winning
percentage so out of 50 trade there's
about 35 trade you can profit from and
there's about 15 trade you can maybe
kind of even or take a loss from it so
let's put the worse situation 15 of
those trades that you are pretty much
taking loss every single time so each
trade you are risking about 7 percent of
the original investment which is $1,000
maybe 750 so that's about 70 bucks - 100
bucks and since we already calculated we
have 10,000 from the 50 trade and
another 10,000 from those slowly growing
capitals now let's count into the losses
15 trade consistent loss and we can add
about extra 5,000 mouses so 20,000 -
5,000 that's about 15,000 per year and
as we need to add the fees in the barrel
fees so typically fees are around 5% of
your overall profits and 15% kind of
come from the borrow fee or the short
sale fees
so ecn commissions and the short sale
borrow fees over a plus together will be
around 15% to 20% ish and it's give the
maximum 20% so we have about 15,000
overall profit times about 20% that's
$3,000 so 15,000 - $3,000 that's over a
$12,000 profit in net within a year so
with the $3,000 account we can profit
about 12,000 and with at 7,000 maybe
$10,000 we can profit about maybe seven
15,000 were 17,000 so that's a rough
calculations of how to really grow a
small County how to put into the factor
you'll need the frequency of the pattern
how much you can gain from the pattern
and how much you are willing to risk
over the pattern and always counting the
winning percentage as well and - of the
mistakes - it all comes down to you how
we want to stay disciplined so we're all
growing a little small counts of raw
processor and 3,000 count it's a very
small capital the lower capital you have
the less chance you have to screw up so
at the beginning disciplines the number
one thing for you to follow then wants
to get you a mere account size you can
risk a little bit more but you still
need to be careful with don't blow up
your entire account size don't go and
and always stay under certain risk
management always have a maximum dollar
loss and once you get through the first
year going to the second year will be
much easier since you're over DT rules
now we haven't count into the PDT rules
because waiting year were only placing
about 70 trades so but it is about
overall 200 something trading days
divided by 7 8 so there's going to be
every trade for 3 days PDT you can only
place about three to four trades per
week so you actually fits the perfect
materia so you don't need to worry about
PD T's now when there's more opportunity
coming within a week you can have to
trade a little bit more so once you get
through the first year and searching you
will be much easier and once your
accounts bigger your your you cannot
afford to make mistakes as well so
that's pretty much all the calculations
for how to really gross account within a
year hopefully this is helpful before we
get into this entire simulations always
tractor statistics and figure out what
pattern you wanna trade always stick to
one or two patterns to grow your small
account and at the end of this video
thank you very much and I will see you
guys in the next one

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
that's all guys do moon ducks here today
we're gonna talk about most common
questions that people will ask me that's
why won't you trade options why when you
share a future is about to trade that
blue chip stocks let me give you a very
specific reason why I trade around
somewhere between 10 to 200 million
dollar stock anywhere above that I've
been really traded anywhere below that
I've barely traded the reason why is to
be able to consistent profitable in one
sector it takes a lot of work
once you become consistent profitable
and you have to really focus on how to
really maximize your profit then that's
a whole different tracking and you have
to find the average percentage you're
pushing in the morning average
percentage of dropping in the morning so
there are a lot of details for you to
really focus on when you are trading
life this also talked about when you
trade multiple stocks at once so to say
I'm trading somewhere between one to two
hundred million stocks and on the same
time trading 1 billion dollar stock and
those two different sector have
completely different reactions when
you're trading the morning let's say
average pushing percentage is around 15%
in the morning for billion dollars a
character pretty much the wrench is
around 20% there's also so much factors
involved in there so be a volume news
and different news and q1 or company and
file or thank you those are so many
factors involved in those two sectors so
you can really switch your mindset from
this sector to this sector sometimes you
get so used to it you be very good with
trading stocks and there's gotta be some
of it you miss when you're switching
back and forth back and forth because
you are trading life so I found that
really tiny especially when I'm trading
to different sectors at the same time
everybody just focused one and get all
the details together I can be more
focused on one and they have higher
success rate just by my own performance
throughout the year now most of the time
I'm day trading when I'm focused on
options futures and penny stocks I'm
treating three different zones at same
time that would be extremely difficult
for me
I'll rather just focus on one and build
more advantage into this one sector and
force my performance making less
mistakes because when I'm treating more
sectors and making more mistakes now
let's also add in very specific details
into the level 2 actions okay
so level 2 are the huge difference
between micro flow and the bigger phone
and also the macro tab and the large gap
those two have different narratives and
sometimes size huge size matters in
lower cap sometimes huge size doesn't
matter in higher cap different flow
reacts with different size let's say 200
thousand shares on a bit it is very
small compared to like this say 200
million full and to building our market
cap or tune beating our market cap
200,000 shares is relatively very small
and if you put 200,000 shares into a
micro cap and that's about 20% of the
entire flow if it's the flow is 1
million so when you're looking those
level to use because they're all life so
they're bouncing back and forth back and
forth and you're trading 2 tickets at
the same time then you're looking those
low level twos when they don't react the
same your mind had to switch back and
forth back and forth now sometimes
you're making mistakes and say oh let me
trace a lot of shares in the billion
dollar market cap because we are so used
to looking at a level 2 in the market
caps then sometimes we'll give you a
different reactions and once you click
the bottom you're already regretting now
so level 2 is very important we're in
treating multiple sectors I think that
is probably number one reason why I
don't trade specifically in stocks blow
chips and market caps those two I hate
treating them the same time now let's
talk about Al gross in futures there is
bunch of algos not strategists are
building the futures and the reason why
they can be algos is the tickers are the
same so you're training the same taker
over and over and over again in penny
stocks you have so many different
tickers do you change names if you
reverse splits and flow are not the same
so it's really difficult to Bureau I'll
go in the penny stock area compared to
the futures market so that will be the
video for today hopefully you get the
major point
and I will see you guys the next video

should have sized him much more
aggressively because of very sufficient
volume on both tickers and we had couple
spikes until GM did its massive offering
up about in June 7th so if the chart was
affected by offering and it was dropped
by offering this is not a natural
developed chart and that's where I did
not size into the 48 because I knew that
there is a massive support around 30 to
40 and sizing up at 48 isn't a very good
place to get enough Ward so that's why I
just not for forgot about it and did not
trade it for the rest of the day and
based on those two opportunities the
only chance that I see is shorting into
the breakdown after the resistance
confirms and uh I don't think I missed
any other play but uh of course other
than that the size was a problem and uh
the rest of it is think I did okay on

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
I developed one of the systems for me is
every time when I made a mistake I size
down in the next one. So 50% of the
positions compared to the previous one
if I make a mistake again then size
down. So I keep my size in control so I
don't lose sometimes 50% of my accounts.
That's one of the thing that's very
essential for traders and also make sure
to take your profits as well. Whenever
you made a huge trade I have to tell
myself that I actually took a loss
because I withdraw money from that
trade. So let's say I made a million
bucks this trade. I just withdraw 800K.
I would tell myself multiple times it's
a losing trade cuz I just took 800K loss
so I only made 200K and that made me
more careful going to the next trade
because you have to kind of counter
human emotion because human nature is
very I don't want to say greedy but it
is greedy. So the more you make the more
greedy you are. So I know that it's one
of the big disadvantage that trader
cannot avoid. So just use that method to
counter that emotion.

A lot of people go into this industry
because they see how much money they can
make. I actually love trading. I just
love being there and love to being
competitive, but you cannot be so
competitive that you feel formal about
it.
&gt;&gt; Be willing to take the loss. First of
all, people are not coming into this
game for the right reason. And second,
they cannot last as long. People tend to
get too emotional, fight one ticker for
one or two days, blew up their account,
then never come back again. The key
component for this is you have to be in
this game long enough to see how
yourself really behave throughout the
years and find a way to actually like a
method to let's say withdraw your money
after profitable win. Think about that
withdraw money is actually a loss. Find
method to counter yourself because it's

instant gratifications for how much

we had another ticker which is very

one went all the way down fitted 100%

minute shares in the premium Market of
course 3 minute float it's not a big
float majority of the time we will see
at least some push percentage in after
market open this one did not push at all
it was trading like it's a 10 million
float of course saying into the bouns
when it already fitted 60% or 75% from
the top was not very ideal if you
brought shares you can size into the
push and the major consolidation is at
eight so I will say shorting to the
bounces risking eight is not a bad idea
but you can't really size in as big as
you wanted

500 000 on this trade so today i'm going
to go over my thinking process and where
i entered and exited so you guys can
learn from my entry and exit and
hopefully you guys can become a
consistent profitable trader so other
than that don't forget to hit the like
button if you have any questions please
leave a comment below and let's get into
the video today all right guys let's get
into the chart
so cei it's displayed right here
i made several trades on it so let's go
over the entire thinking process and
why this is a short and also
why is this a swing short as well
all right let's look at
15-day chart
two minutes so this one has been running
up for the last almost a month
if you can take a look at it on switch
today so
overall starting from point four and all
the way to almost five dollar per share
and every single day is trading max
amount of volume since one since the
breakout at two dollar area
extension based on uh the consolidation
breakout is around probably three
hundred percent so two two three hundred
percentage
right i was waiting for this one to at
least extending a hundred percent front
consolidation which has met
um my requirement so 1.8 times 2 that's
3.6
and another day and that's very similar
to
the consolidation as well
right here around
september 28th it consolidated around
3.1 and i was thinking that if this one
tends to break out 3.1 this one needs to
go to six
but on this day trade almost over a
billion
volume so a billion shares being
exchanged enhanced and they had a
massive drop one from five to three so
unfortunately i did not catch the drop
right here now since it's pretty much
unpredictable
and it's trading
so much volume that it's really
competitive in that case it's not really
worth it too short or to build a swing
short
once the balance happened it gapped up
back to the 4.4 area this is where i
started to short
my average is between 4.25 to 4 ish
i enter some of it right here enter some
of it right here as well overall i held
the entire day because i was planning to
switch for this one
so for in the second day i
held again went all the way to 2.86
i covered a little bit around 3.1 then i
held again
on the third day then covered pretty
much all of my shares around 1.1 that's
my last cover majority of the shares
were covered around 1.65
that's my entry and exit but how did i
really
i would say
have the confidence to hold this long so
first of all that the chart is pretty
much overextended if you take a look at
the six months chart it's up about
almost a thousand percent from 0.4
starting right here
and it took many many days to go up to
that level to five dollars so when the
start tends to drop it would take many
days as well this is not like an
interest intraday trade
that you can gain fifty to seventy five
percent in one day because it's not
entirely short so once you find a really
good entry right
then you held
when the stock tends to drop informs
consolidations once it cracks under the
consolidation you can reassure and build
your average into the consolidation
resistance
uh what do i mean by that so basically
you can take a look at it i showed it
around 4.25 right i write it down all
the way to
uh
i covered some of it at 310 you can see
that it formed another resistance right
here
around 3.4
so i averaged in again to
pull down my average to the 3.4 2.5 area
that's where my entry becomes my risk so
in this case i feel much safer
especially that if i'm shorting under a
consolidation resistance
and that's where
i did not expecting this one to drop
this hard today i was aiming for a 2.8
dollar support to break
once it broke uh did not think you can
drop almost you know
a dollar more because 75 percent of the
entire chart is around the two dollar
area and also there's a massive support
around two so i was aiming to cover
there i covered a little bit around 2.25
into the panic
and covered the rest around 110.
all right so for overall ci trade i
don't really have any regrets on it uh
only regret will be not adding to the
3.6 pop which was right about here
but other than that uh when cia was
going 50 in one day or dropping 50 in
one day uh in one of those trades i
doesn't really matter if you go long or
short you're going to end up in the
shoe so this is where the market is
trying to test your risk management and
in some days you are going to end up in
the wrong side uh whenever it's popping
fifty percent you're shorting or when
it's going long then it's dropping fifty
percent you have to have a solid solid
risk management so in this way when the
site is going to your way you can
amplify your gains and the stock is
going the opposite way you are expecting
you can minimize your losses that's how
you stay consistent profitable hopefully

what's up guys how you guys doing this
weekend or this week sorry I'm not
posting that much this week a little bit
sick and traveling to New York and
choose some people in person today I'm
going to talk about ways that happen
this week and they're not much going on
and there's a couple things you need to
be careful when you are trading or
you're treating your long-term or you're
still studying there's a couple bad
habits that people make most of the time
especially on when trading is kind of
boring there's not much actually going
on and people are getting into random
place that they not supposed to get a
name and people are chasing weakness and
choosing strength on different tickers
without playing on different patterns so
today I'm going to talk about whitey
steel and iron px so let's get started
so why you see oh it was consolidating
him for a couple days now after that
massive bounce short and the price are
neutralized in five to six area so in
those couple days is trading really thin
volume and people are trading it they're
treating this 570 as a support so that
keep deep buying it and since there's a
lot of resistance up up ahead to the
price range is not moving that much so
when the stock is slowly turning up
which means it starts it starts to slow
grind it is really difficult to shorten
to any kind of spike especially on micro
flow we are shooting your micro flow
since you don't have that much risk or
word it is really difficult and it's not
what even worth it to shore into some
noodles back like this I think went from
7 to 8 inch up from 850 to 7 but most of
the time and fell off his own spike but
what happens if the stock breaks 10
and you start fulfilling the nonsense
because slow rotations can cause the
International stock to spike then what
happens it break the resistance then
logic we're gonna freak out is going to
cause short squeezes so the first thing
to kind of know when you are using a
pattern and ask yourself is to ticker
worthy not for the risk reward if it
doesn't don't even touch it is the
ticker mister criteria use expect over
fifty or seventy percent on these to
bounce or gap up short if the spike is
not too much in if it's only twenty
percent it's not even worth that you
have that reward compared to the risk
and the risk that we're judging is the
stock is a micro flow and the price is
neutralized really really close to the
spike level so that is why people when
they are not seeing place for a couple
days they're Kinnaman bored and they
want the profit because they think the
market will consist and give you profit
no matter what can play but it is wrong
so all you need to do on trading is to
filter out the bad trades and only do
the good good trades because that kind
of habits will help you grow in amount
earn if you are trading the place that
I'm not supposed to be trading trading
with really thin volume that stock is
only 100k on a day once you get those
bad habits it's really hard to get rid
of them and also don't trade all those
bad traits will help you especially
boost your confidence in trading and
help you grow consistently and to be
more cautious with the risk level since
you boost a lot more confidence you're
afraid of losing so you will be more
cautious about all those mistakes that
you make in those single tickers and
that's and that's why I want to talk
about why you see all the sticker is
pretty much dead I'll probably think a
decent swing positions risking $10 level
that would like to just the ticker spike
much closer to 10
I have a terroristic to swim but out
anyways I don't think my usio is worth
it enough to short and to swim it in a
long run because not worth the ball
trees
I am P X so our reverse split stops a
lot of people like to chase because they
think I'll get the stock is over 220
thousand percent but it's actually not
this doctor did a reverse split that
flow divided by whatever amount the
rivers whatever amount the reverse split
lives and and the stock price will
basically time how many times of the
reverse split that did I'm stock it is 1
to 2 it is 1 to 200 then the start will
the stock price will basically times 200
and the flow go divided by 200 that
typically a lot of people are new to
this industry you don't know what the
first spray this and they see the ticker
pop on their scanner so why not they
think okay the stock is already up two
thousand percent twenty thousand percent
and
it has a high possibility to spike
another 10 20 30 percent but all those
spikes are going to fail because they
are really long heavy and there's a tons
of resistance or if the stock like stood
over split and they're likely to have
warrants in it and basically companies
are serving warrants into those spikes
that will cause a felf spike that drops
50% of its own high that is exactly what
happened
I am TX so a lot of people think of them
missing the plate on a shorter and
they're chasing into business into
releasing my own so Pelt close to your
attention the stock was or is only
trading 20,000 40,000 shares so you are
if you are chasing and you're basically
affecting the stock because the stock
doesn't have a lot of liquidity if you
are trapped
is going to be a pain to get out of
stock because you are basically
affecting the stock again and you're
basically if you recover you will push
the stock even more
and if you're selling there's not enough
bid for you to selling to you so
basically you're gonna end up in a
really bad execution especially we are
chasing in all those reverse splits
first they don't have enough volume
second there's a tons of resistance
ahead so if you even though if you go
short around it's not going to be a good
odds end up the day so when I start does
a reverse split I typically don't touch
it until they have massive amount of
volume something like at least four
miniatures dead this stuck on me trade
800k volume throughout the entire day so
that's a no touch for me and basically
that's what I want to explain for
reverse splits and when press start
neutralized it's really difficult to
shorten to really close range because
the support is there and we all know
about micro flow stop the sap flow is
under one medium which will be extremely
difficult shorting to when there's not
enough risk/reward
so hopefully this resin helps and I will
try to catch on my video lessons

================================================

that's what guys do now so I did get a
lot of quests for people that wants me
to do an analysis I thought all those
takers be around recently so today I'm
going to give no couple tickers that
shows you the general statistics and
also give you the understanding of what
time should you trade them what timing
shouldn't be trading and also some of
the indicators that you should be
noticed before the action happens and
can help you avoid making mistakes and
stop orbit trading so let's get into the
video today I'm going to cover five
takers overall will be you know all the
seekers are considered very difficult
takers to be able to predict the action
let's start with G and Yi is not very
low flow the flow is over three minutes
it's not considered as a very low flow
market cap is over 20,000,000 so if the
market is over 20 million is not
considered micro-cap that's a general
pretty ideal ticker for me to trade and
if you take a look at the resistance in
the history to hit resistance started
back in May 13th it's around $6 ish and
in this day the stock started ringing in
the mid day after 11:00
you can see how choppy it is you can see
this massive bursting candle of short
squeeze and after everybody cover and
just failure all the way back and
squeezed again but end of the day this
is the action I was talking about pretty
much all the time we are trying to use
pattern into different time zone the
final warning percentage can change
massively just between you know after 11
were before 11 most of my very high
winning percentage pattern always happen
before you Levin o'clock so we are
trying to trade after 11:00 or at midday
your winning percentage will massively
be reduced so I wouldn't really
recommend as a beginner to trade after
11:00 because the action would become
not choppier the most volatile time will
be 9:00 to 11:00 then 3:30 to 4:00
journey between 3 to 4 there's done that
many patterns I've been tracking for a
while does have very good winning
percentage so overall I don't really
trade anywhere between 3 to 4 majority
of my time will be spending in between
9:00 to 11:00 so if you don't really
stop herbal trading only focus on the
time period between 1911 that's where
you can base that's where I make the
most of my money and also it's very easy
to predict how the stock will react now
let's talk about CPA
this one happened a week ago I can see
the action on first Green Day
now generally on first Green Day it's
very hard to predict how to start where
we'll be at because you don't really
know how many shorts are in it how many
rounds are in there and what is the
percentage of shooting and what's the
percentage of going long and overall I
couldn't really find a very good pattern
just by using first Green Day and the
volume prediction or potentially fatal
potentially breakout in my general
statistics if the star tends to break
out in the morning high and consolidate
fail 50 percent right around here so the
overall game will be between 1:30 to 3
and failed back to 170 almost 50% of the
entire game right here and with tends to
break out it's always tends to do like a
fake alibi in this case it didn't do it
actually just squeezed from the
consolidation so this is the risk I'm
talking about when I try to shore first
Green Day is very very dangerous for
cherlene we don't have mass amount
experienced trading first Green Day I
don't really suggest training that at
all it's favor too long not sure so for
short sellers do not touch your screen
day especially on a low cap and low flow
and low cap is anywhere between 20
million market cap low flow will be
anywhere between under 3 million flow so
in this case it fits both the criteria
on first green day no resistance and
that's not touchable at all so the third
ticker I'm gonna talk about at the same
time now if you notice that CPA age and
s NCAA they both trade a maximum volume
in that first green day you can see it
right here 40 million volunteer aid s
NCAA semi 880 million vomit rated right
here overall volume trade is I can
pretty much see it right here almost 80
medium volume so if the volume exceeds
30 minute a day it's considered very
crowded you can kind of think about
psychology behind it if the stock gets
crowded that means there's a lot of
people trying to go short and long
different people I say it's own opinion
and now create more competitions if
there's a lot more people trying to go
long and short and if it gets extremely
crowded the more people it gets the more
crowded will get more crowded gates
there's more competition that will
castle start become very unpredictable
if you take a look at see PAH
in CA CET X also 50 million shares
traded s in CA 80 million say pH 40
million TCC all same-same very difficult
charter tree on the first green day 25
million this one is a little bit lower
this one the volume is a little bit over
because it's a microbe flow it's under 2
million flow and extremely dangerous
I see a lot of people taking a loss
shorting TCC lct excess NCAA ph.d and
year as well they're not really focused
on the potential odds of the pattern
they're focusing on the general action
if you only jump into action you want to
see actions that's not the pattern for
you to trade even though for potentially
going wrong we are looking at very
probable hedge fund while people are
just waiting for 10 set up for a year we
are so eager to join to action that
means you're trying to over trade so if
I become 10 percent of the people you
can't trade into these days not use the
statistic just by reversing an
engineering into the people psychology
so if 90% people lose money in the
market NP so if 90% of people lose money
in the market and 10% people make money
in the market and we will see a crowded
trade that means most people are just
generally trading the market and that's
where 90% people come from 10% people
just stay there and I'm waiting for the
start do like a predictable action when
stock is crowded that means majority of
the traders are jumping in that's where
the 90% is now for you want to be a
considered proper trader you have to
wait until the action finishes for a
chart or a resistance or potentially
make a predictable action use that
psychology of people who are lost money
in the crowded trades and take advantage
of them to make a problem use the
psychology of people who already lost
one in stock and they wanted desperately
getting now then you can use the synergy
of that you potentially shortened to a
stock so December January February and
March those are pretty much the most
active seasons that you can trade your
stock there's a lot of action going on
back and forth I know you want to trade
so if you want to become consistent you
have to stay super disciplined
especially we are looking at in all our
actions and you can't find the edge for
potential trading opportunities and
that's my general taking how to really
trade in general market
the more crowded it is and you don't
trader at all the last part is you go
and trade the more crowded tracy becomes
it becomes potential opportunity for you
to trade later on but not treating on
that current day so that we out the
video leave a comment below do not tray
into very crowded stocks because you're
likely to lose money
hope this video lesson helps and we're
hosting a conference in New York in
March 28 29 and 30th if you're not join
the March conference make sure to click

let's all guys still not sure how
welcome to this week we cab and today
we're gonna talk about some of the
tickers that happen this week and how
much things going on so before I get
into the videos I have a conference
coming up in August 17 18 19 if you guys
want to come watch me live trade ask me
some questions and enjoyed all the
trader conference I'll put a link below
click the link and it will take you
straight to the registration page we
only have a few spot left so make sure
you get your spot conference upcoming in
two weeks so here are the tickers I'm
going to talk about SMS sign which is
today's capper so we went from three
point four to four point eight it looks
like a gap up short but as I talked
about before when the stock is getting
up especially when the stock market cap
is over 100 million these are very
dangerous to shorting to and to go along
with because when you want to go along
you 100 million market cap you need a
hundred million to inject into the
current Murray cap to make the stock go
up 100 percent when the stock starts to
drop when they drop about 10 to 20
percent you will lose about I say 20 to
30 million in the market cap as well and
these stickers are not generally
considered as penny stocks because if
the market cap is over a hundred million
over and the price is $5 above and they
don't really consider your assets that
they consider like a micro cap or a mid
cap so these stocks are really hard to
die when we're shooting into bound short
gap up Shore and all the starting money
copies are around like 10 million 20
million 30 million those are
conservative America caps so these type
of stocks are extremely bad especially
in fundamental so they have negative
cash flows and they're trying to pump
the stocks to pull offering out to take
more money from the investors and that's
how to give their money and that's how
they can support their company to keep
going for these type of bigger
cap stocks they don't really need to do
offerings if they have sufficient cash
flow then they are likely to come back
SM si so when people are trying to show
into this gap up short and without any
type of historical charts volume was
training very very low as the board
since today that's why shooting these
type of takers are not very ideal now
one of the other questions I get
sometimes Allah is well if the stock is
up like say 40% 50% or 60% what's the
minimum volume for me to to trade in so
when you look at tickers something like
Opio and they just do the reverse bit
now first when you look at a reverse
split is when you study like say one to
ten one to twenty they would reduce
their flow change the market cap
ultimate area becomes not as good before
let's say $2 as resistance there's about
sixty minute resistance and sixty minute
resistance so hundred twenty minute
resistance around $2 once it does a
reverse flip all the resistance changes
and everything becomes not suitable for
the current ticker so you have to treat
those tickers as completely different
charts now second thing is after reverse
split what you typically have to go back
into SEC thousand define the current
float and when you look at the current
day and when stock is up about forty
percent and total volume trading about
1.6 1 million more minimum volume and he
was required by ticker is that is for
mini intraday so when you're shorting in
to this type of parabolic even has
resistance if it the volume is under a
100k it's not really true to what at all
so if you wanna do on like a low flow or
good news breakout always always be
careful anabolic when you're trading
something with a really tiny volume
something like one can pre candle is a
hundred K or less or just barely over
100 K and we're trying to buy the
breakout these type of breakouts are
very likely to fake out because there's
only baby monitors it's been trading and
when you want to get out you will affect
the could it since there is very little
share screen trading across the entire
day so when you want to use any
a pattern let's say you're treating some
type of strategies or trading doesn't
matter the matter it go along or sure
always pay attention to the market cap
my recap is the keys you'll be able to
apply any type of pattern into different
tickers mary cap is the first thing you
wanna look at typically for me I don't
really wanna trade anything above two
hundred million market cap if I see
there's a huge resistance two hundred
million three hundred mania and the bear
cave is over two hundred million then
it's a automatically filtered so this
ticker I don't where you want to
consider to show you two anymore no
matter how heavy the resistances for
your scanners when you're trading all
types of different strategies try to
find the perfect zone for yourself let's
say you are very good with trading 500
meaning or above to $1,000,000,000 cap
and you find your correct strategy in
there and you found out all your
vertical trading and a billion dollar
gap or above and all types of ranges
because when you are trading these
several ranges let's say 10 million or
Tony Manero recap compared with 100
million to 200 minimal recap those two
different charts will perform completely
different because well first the level
two will be different second the charts
will be different the stuffing will be
different the panic percentage will be
different so when you are trading and
find the most comfortable zone that you
want to trade you will be most likely
consistent profitable I don't really
believe you can really scalping all
types of market cap zone then you will
be able to know all types of average
pushing percentage average
penny person into average stuff in
Kindle volume because all these type of
market cap zones are different so what I
recommend is even go long and short
first find the correct strategy second
find your perfect market cap zone then
go from there nice reminder if you are
not register for the conference I will
put a link below hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video and if you guys want
to come to your conference I will see

================================================

Kind: captions
Language: en
what's up guys doing daxter today I'm
gonna talk about my monthly performance
and I think all the number plus together
equals around $140,000 and I think I did
pretty good this month I focused on the
right place and I minimize my losses
every single time my last goes over five
thousand I will automatically stop three
and wait until next day so if you treat
your trading as your career and focus on
the long term because there's
opportunities every day and the pending
stuffs are really hard for the reason
couple weeks there's Gabor's every
single day there's tickers trading on
hundred million shares current day and
multiple tickers trading over 100
million shares and so there's a lot of
opportunities out there and the key is
to how to catch it and wait until the
right opportunity to go in so my basic
thoughts on this month is cutting my
losses focus on two or three plays and
keep your losses really small so as you
can see my gains are not as impressive
as last couple month but the losses are
minimized and you can see that there's
only four losses or there's actually
five losses on a day so
and I kept almost all days are green and
always keep your head fresh and tree
trading as your career so if you
thinking that you're not focused on the
right place is the place making you
emotional and you're going into midday
trading and that's terrible because we
New York when you get emotional it's
just caused a chain reaction for you to
lose and lose and keep losing more so
you wanna cut that and keep your fresh
head and keep that going keep going and
today I want to kind of talk about my
two plays that happens
today teacher of the ticker I made a
decent play on it so let's talk about
and 8 k d and d n so in DM truly about
40 million shares last yesterday and you
can see a clear momentum shift right
here he cracked from 32 to radiate and
consolidated into $3 ish so the most
shares are traded up right here and in
the morning so people who bought in the
midday or people who shorted in the
midday whatever shares are traded you
know that 90% shares are long 10% shares
are sure that's just as you know a
number so most people holding it out
right here once the moment and start
shifting and it's also truly massive
volume it's really hard to come back
because up here is they're just too much
too many of back orders so I took a
little swing positions right here and it
is a perfect overstated gap down and
sized incorrectly and it turns out I
cover in two lows in the two 30s I
didn't even I didn't pollen ticket I
didn't even top ticket but I cut the
most piece of it and cross under a KD I
made about $23,000 today so when people
cannot short and if you have a small
account I don't think you have the right
broker
there's brokers out there that you can
find shares to short and all the players
I called in the chatroom
and I don't buy low flow stocks I don't
sell when my chat room members are buy
so I don't take chat room with members
money and the key for them is to learn
to learn how the market works to know
people psychology I think in penny stock
sector psychology is the most important
you have
understand where the short is where the
long is and you have to be also
understand how does extreme low flow
works and if it the flow is extreme
there's not many people training and
small amount of people can make a huge
price jump so I avoid trading low flow I
don't pump local stocks just to be clear
and I only trade i only even alert flow
any tickers that flows over 20,000,000
so the key is for you to know to focus
on the right play and when you are
focused on too many plays and you want
to make money right away it's just not
gonna work because nothing comes really
quickly and he even takes me two years
to really really get the hang of it how
does this how do you let me think how do
you trade trading career for a long turn
because when you're trading your Lantern
you want to minimize your risk as much
as possible you want to stay stress-free
and when I when I see people shorting a
geo MD just look at this all right
it's a 300% gapper so people are shown
in brandy without any resistance now
when you're shooting this high
volatility stocks right so when they
drop you drop really quick and when they
come back they come back really quick so
sometimes when you don't have a risk
level when the stocks back too quick and
just blow up your resistance and you
don't have any risk to it any risk level
to risk and that would be a disaster so
that will make you emotional and what
happens the style just burst at $27 and
goes to 1450 you matter a couple minutes
you don't have time to rap because you
are not confident
and we are confident you know where to
cut you don't you know where to cover
you know exactly what your plan is but
we are shooting with a low-resistance
you don't know where to cut you don't
have exactly to take a profit because on
the chart if you took at a 4-year chart
it just no support whatsoever and just
gapped up huge it out of nowhere and
where are you gonna find your support
where are we gonna find your resistant
no so just let the chart develop and let
the chart form support let in chart form
resistance that you go in you know what
the risk with you have confidence
confidence is really important in
trading because when you don't have
confidence and that will make you
emotional and emotional trades coming in
you take a loss and get motional again
you want to make that money back you
take another loss and just chain
reaction and you will lose your monthly
gains your ear again sometimes so that's
why
just let the chart form whatever it
needs to be formed and you go in and
make sure that little bit of range that
you can predict same thing with Bo okay
I think most people hammer in the first
green day and people losing seventy
thousand one hundred dollars and two
hundred thousand think it was a a
disaster on Twitter
same thing was GOM D now what happens is
first green that goes to fifty now why
you come to our gonna shorten at fifty
because the stock went up too high
there's never gap up too high there's
never dropped up too much you have to
focus
resistance support volume and figure out
what point is shorter managed well
points along on advantaged so keep that
in mind and if you are too
don't know what to trade just find one
pattern right find that one pattern that
happens a lot you see a lot in the
market right
so you track them you track them every
single time when it happens now you
separate criteria use a split low-flow
mid cap a large cap right so small cap
make Captain Archer into three sections
and you track patterns of each sections
once you track Mel enough there's a
average winning percentage out there so
you can use the average 20 percentage
and they said if a pattern when a person
is over 70 percent good right seven out
of ten times I'm winning so when you see
what kind of sometimes criterias are
different now well cup what happens when
the court here happens and the stuff
drops harder now when stock drops harder
what I'm gonna react I'm gonna size even
bigger to maximum profit now what
happens this quarter doesn't happen I'm
gonna minimize my position to setting
smaller so minimize your risk and
maximum your profit is two key to
winning the stock market and I don't
think money doesn't really matter when
you making money in the stock market yes
it doesn't matter but focus on the
winning person on the pattern matters
more because when you see on the numbers
right when you see on the money you are
making then you just want to make more
money and your ego gets bigger and then
you're you don't increase your risk
that's where you starting start losing
so that's why I said money doesn't
matter pattern meirin's more because
pattern met met pattern makes matters
more sorry about that in the long run so
thank you very much I hope this video
doesn't make sense and for tier 2 people
I see you are very excited and I do show
database
all of my eight patterns now the best
pattern that works it's balanced shorter
kept alive sure or I think it's all
pristine gap down so choose one of the
patterns you want to focus on focus on
that roller account once your account
gets bigger testing multiple strategies
and expand your pattern expand your
strategies then you will make more money
so now I'll be here for today
thank you very much and you guys have a
great day

let me repeat myself again first one
will be uh you have to have a good
winning percentage pattern doesn't have
to be more than two if you have one
that's the best uh that you have to keep
consistently tracking your statistics to
find your Edge second one once you have
a many patterns you can build a risk
management system on different patterns
as I said that you can size in much
bigger into a ticker that has 85%
winning percentage you can size in
smaller into a pattern that only have
60% winning percentage the last one is
uh that you have to protect yourself all
times and if you tend to make mistakes
it's okay many people make mistakes uh
the problem is that you have to make
sure you can keep consistently trading
this Market to G experience in the
future

I think last year we had like five
months of nothing other than bigger caps
so what I used to do is I track a a
setup that I wanted to trade
specifically um how many times it happen
throughout the year and each time you
know what's my winning percentage um how
much I'm likely to gain how much I'm
likely to lose and you can kind of get a
rough estimate to see that you know this
is how much you're going to make by the
end of the year so once you know that
numbers you are much more patient than
you know other traders
that that can't you know wait for the
opportunity and they start forcing
trades so a lot of people now go for a
CH a lot of people you know tracking
trades is you know it's a common thing
that we've all kind of been around heard
about talked about doing a lot of people
do it I myself have done and

hello guys steven dux here so last week
was kind of crazy you can see mark is
crashing
and we just had a little bit recovery by
friday and also we had pretty much all
the defensive stocks like walmart and
target all the stickers are going down
20 30 percent in a week
so a lot of i would say doubt in the
stock market currently compared to the
kobe times because while the kovac cases
was going up day by day and hundreds and
thousands of cases growing each day that
created so much fear that the market
crashed 30 percent
yeah just about two weeks so in this
case uh we're not as rushy compared to
the kobe times in my opinion and we took
about seven to eight weeks of the market
slowly settling down because of the fed
tends to raise rates there's a lot of
question about if the fed is really
going to fight inflation or not and
currently the market is believing the
fed is going to crash the inflation
meanwhile uh during the small cap area
we had several place currently we have
the same cycle that happened in 2020
since monkey pox virus is
i would say spreading across the
internet and making people aware of it
and all those vaccine companies tend to
spike again
so in this video i'm going to explain
how to trade especially in this i would
say very low volume time
it happened exactly during the copy time
i can point out a couple tickets out so
you can you know pay attention to it and
study from history and learn how to
trade uh in the upcoming weeks so before
i start make sure to click the like
button and subscribe if you have any
questions leave a comment below and
let's get into the tickers so right now
kodi ex is one of the tickers that
happened during the covey times you can
see it's spiked around in february 28
2020 and this is exactly the same time
that
the market is
crashing you can see starting around
april i would say
february 28th this is the market when
it's going down those type of vaccine i
would say biotech sector tends to spike
a lot more while the stock market is
freaking out if this virus is going to
impact the market or not and we have
tons of fear so a lot of people tend to
go along those vaccine companies and we
can study from the history now how
people really traded on
kodx back in the days uh the starting
i think they did tons of offering on
kodx i will have to go back and find
what's the beginning cap but i do
remember uh kodx was around uh 300
million to 500 million cap
uh in terms of market cap sorry um and
stocking about this is where it starts
to break out and start spiking so it's
counting from the three dollars so three
to
twenty two so overall
now again about seven hundred percent
uh remember this is a relatively small
cap so you expect a lot more compared to
something like siga with much bigger cap
and you can see that overall volume
before
the whole
printing mounting that happened in i was
between march and april in 2020 that's
where the cash was poured into the stock
market and pop up the markets and that's
where the volume becomes much more
compared to prior 2020. so entering kodx
this happened right before all the
stimulus check came into the market and
this volume is really useful because
in the during this time there is not
much stimulus to pop up the volume so
you can use this volume as your
advantage to really i would say you know
kind of get a decent idea of how to
calculate what's the maximum volume and
can be treated in one day what's the
maximum amount of dollar can be treated
in one day and now how do you decide to
take your short positions when the
stocks perform maximum spiking range
s-i-g-i you can see
right now the market cap is 1.1 billion
so let's
say the stock started to spike around
seven
um get the uh up to
10 start to spike uh all the way up to
12. so
right now it only only gained about well
right that's 15. so it gained about a
hundred percent off the bottom and the
market cap originally was 500 million
so on this sticker it's not going to
spike you know 700 compared to kodx but
you can kind of say you know at least go
up three to five times so going from
seven to thirty five seven to
the high twenties to thirty five
um
for a potential short volume is still
pretty significant i will say all the
stimulus check has not been flushed out
the market yet there's still i would say
30 to 50 percent of the stimulus left in
the market and now we would
uh
once we burn through all those cash then
we would go back to
the 2019 2019-2018 type of volume
trading relatively slow but
the volume is i was still higher than
kodx
and the only edge you can get is during
february 28th traded on this day traded
about 50 million volume on the 20 so
that's 1 billion traded in that day
then
right about here 21 traded about 30
minutes that's about 600 million dollar
trade that day so overall on the top of
those two candles traded two billion
dollar i said roughly
and on siga this one's still going on
the parabolic so a consolidation
breakout
once the ticker tends to consolidate
like codx you can kind of tell that how
much volume and dollar is being traded
up in the consolidation zones then you
can use the reference on kodk of how
much data is being traded
during the lower 20s
and
we can kind of get idea of where it's
likely to drop so i would say
once sigma tends to consolidate trading
anywhere between at least 70 million
volume around
20 to 30 dollar area
that should be
the top four sigi but
where i still don't know yet the stock's
still gapping up so i would prefer that
the stock goes up much higher to create
a shorting opportunities
so sijo will be not the only one after
codx there is about four or five players
out it was
vaccine
covey related we should see
a lot of tickers that coming up after
siga so still tons of opportunity left
and that's my uh take on siga so that'll
be the end of this video make sure to
focus on your risk while trading siga
and we're in a really difficult time
especially trading in the current market
so make sure
risk management will always be the first
place that you focus on then focus on
the reward
and that will be the end of this video
thank you very much for watching i will
see you guys in the next one

Language: en
what's up guys even ducks here recently
the markets been really slow so I want
to talk about Zn and a n th I see a lot
of people just assume that the stock is
short heavy but as you can see every
time when the stock holds its support
and try to test that like 2.7 or 2.8
area you always felt that way so when
the stock happens or you hold support
all the time yes you can dip buy but be
really careful when the stock is really
saying that it's very easy to manipulate
by the chat rooms so once you buy with
the chat room but you don't know you are
buying with the chat room once you dump
it you lose your money and very very
quickly so as you can see it went from
twenty two point two point five seven so
if you think you're thinking okay I'm
gonna buy when brick the morning high so
you buy around 2.5 then suddenly drop to
two point three eight nine well this is
not a really good example because it
didn't drop that much but for some wide
range I don't recommend buying really
thin stocks when they are only trading
too many or three miniatures a day
because when you want to focus on some
kind of multi day MOT week very Cal you
have to focus on after breakout so if
you are thinking okay the stock when
22.92 point a then it's testing that
very testing that top but it's not a
breakout by breakout only don't try to
predict the stock is going to break out
so this is why people getting burned by
some chat rooms because they don't know
they're buying with the chair IAM same
thing happened with z and people are
buying it thinking is gonna do a
multi-day multi month break out the
stock will
from 2.2 to $5 and drop back to your
three point four three point eight and
every since then the stock holds three
point eight zero point nine perfectly
for straight five days but every single
time when he reaches to that four point
five area and felt instantly so if
you're thinking okay the stock is up
trending now and very potentially break
that five dollar area okay well it did
it went from six to four in your very
short amount of time are also the stock
is really thin it's not training that
much shares just look at this one candle
dropped from 4.36 to corporate t1 and
this one candle dropped from four point
five to four point three so there's not
that much there's not much room for you
to even react or get out because the
stock is saltine focus on something that
has volume that has the potential also
focus on the breakouts don't focus on
predicting the breakouts in the market
when you try to predict you always lose
only try to react for your best patterns

what's up guys is Stephen ducks sorry I
was late for a weekend video lessons
that I would make it up today and today
I wanna talk about extreme my what are
you going to do if your strategy doesn't
work so the first I want to talk about
September 21st and on September 22
Gnaeus he actually showed clear topping
over $7 and following the next day
perked up failed and actually show the
first red day but so lot of people
shouting after first-rate day once the
first red day squeezed over at 6:28
going to the 654 people are thinking you
are risking these seven dollars but if
you are shorting around 6:20 6:53 seeing
about 70 cents shooting - the first day
on the strength but stock didn't offer
any pull backs and squeeze pass through
this resistance area and with all the
way to $8 and kind of holding this
exactly support around $7 ish and just
completely broke down of a new high
around $9 so the stock has the potential
to break through massive amount of
resistance the first time you actually
broke through is around the $5 if you
look at the previous chart
of three months actually I think it's
about a year yeah on the June actually
may 23rd you had a resistance on $5 but
completely broke through that went all
the way to nine dollars so you have to
recognize what is good on the market and
if the stock shows the strings on the
first time typically shows the strings
on the second time because history
always repeat itself so today you see
this little dip closed around 8:40 hmm
my likes to trap in shorts he traps
shorts from 450 HIV shorts from this
first first red day I was showing it I
took a loss but it was all okay okay I
can wait patient until the back side and
I will be shorting I'm into later this
week or maybe early next week
stock is very very overextended if you
look at the previous there is another
resistance close to the 17th but I
highly doubt it's gonna go to 17
probably it's gonna go back down early
next week
so all the players are favoring long
plays and make sure focus on the right
kind of setups today I want also talk
about eyes on this specific stocks you
see the stock escaping up I typically
don't like to sure wouldn't start
escaping up so when the stock is holding
to support it clearly to the supports
around for 73 years if you dip around
the supporting took a very nice
advantage of this spike breaking to stop
breaking the new highs and the stock
hole its own games pretty well today in
I have another green day tomorrow we
have to see how the market reacts but
the entire market it's shifting and the
moment is trending upwards and the
beneficial side it's the long side not
the short side so always consider to be
dip buy because you recognize the
marketing environment right now so you
have to be always adapting into the
market to stop can't the stock had its
afternoon fade-out or to the support
level and the support holds again
so what big ones just stock hold holding
multiple support and many times that's
uh that's a sign of the stock going
bullish another line I talk about is I
tus during the same sectors and if this
spike at the same time they go down at
the same time if you check out the chart
chart it yes very overextended went from
70 cents to 4.3 if you look at the 15
days chart of five minutes the stock had
it's holding support and breakout this
level around 160 years and start
clearing this support around to took
another huge short squeeze and another
breakout kicking out to new highs and
then stop comebacks down Holdings to
support again so it can clearly
recognize where the support is and the
entire market its shifting and it's
beneficial to the tip by so tip and
support very good risk award hitting the
support gapped up again holding support
entire day 49er support for the entire
day and finally start short squeezing
because the market is now beneficial for
the short side so
for further start coming up this week or
their first screen that second green day
or third Queen day as long as they're
holding major support I will always
considering tip I before I go short
there's four short sell for short side
there's many many short traps almost
every single day so when you are taking
mass is consistently order taking a big
loss or your fear of losing or fear of
missing now take a couple days off and
focus on what is good on the market one
is the beneficial side and you can take
notes down once you adapt you to the
market can change your strategy little
bit also adapt your strategies well
always respect your risk/reward same
thing if your strategy doesn't work
always have a risk word and to protect
yourself form big losses that'll be it
today and I probably will do another
short video lessons in later this week
so yeah that'll be that would that would
be it for today thank you very much you
guys have a good day

what's up guys Steven ducks here today I
want to talk about X and UT as for the
past month this is a really really good
I would say short term supply and demand
meet balance because trading penny
stocks you have to be perfectly
understanding what's supply and demand
and wants to supply once the demand goes
really high and the stock fundamental
doesn't match the point as the stock
prices there's always going to be a
balance point and if the stock is
overextended stuff will drop 50 70 % if
that stock is over so the stock will
balance 50% maybe even break to the new
high and most likely you will see
overextended more now oversold most of
the time so x NE t the stock went from 4
to 2008 as to see the chart i want you
to see the chart as clearly as i'm seen
so you can get understanding of what
people are thinking what it was people's
thoughts so for this one companies was
helped by bitcoin and this this company
has nothing to do with Bitcoin I would
say this they said something about
Bitcoin but China Chinese government are
regularly regulating Bitcoin turning
into rain so that's something to keep in
mind and if the company is in China you
won't
and those hype won't turn into you and
you won't benefit the company and that's
something to keep in mind so this
company is company getting up with hype
so it's not a fundamental it doesn't
have a solid fundamental so let's get
started so this company become hype same
thing to trade to treat everybody
start all Brittany stocks are always
likely to go down and there is going to
be two kinds of people
first there is short term short sellers
next it's going to be around term short
sellers and in my DVD I'm going to
mention with what kind of what kind of
volume and method to use for a long term
short sale volume and method to use for
short term yourself so for this one you
had a triple top or lower high and lower
high for xng around 30 ish once it wants
a crack the support that was talking
shorts from this pop the average is
around like you live on a be something
like that so I covered around this a
point a and I know this one's not a long
term short so I covered instantly and I
didn't even think about adding into pops
or adding into the future fading and and
the sudden and the stock had a short
squeeze for most of them for most of the
time stock had this huge bearish trend
and the stock holds for two days and
start short squeezing brink is breaking
the previous breaking the previous high
this is something for you too
looking forward to go along with because
short squeeze this fast but leave a
bunch of short sellers inside to they
for whatever reason they didn't have a
time to cover or they didn't they wanted
to cover in the pullback so this one
there's 1150 area that cracking spurt
become becomes a solid support that's
why to start bounced from there so you
should chart bouncing from previous
support breaking that looks like a
really good cup of handle bites this
it's a not double top so looks like a
cup in hand though
and for what's the reason behind cup a
hinder because left shores errors behind
some sumptuous drink dear al recovery in
the pullback because you know there is a
support and deep buyers wants to dip by
that support so there's one shorts that
are covered to departs are buying to
support and the bigger ones go insane
that's even creating more hype that's
what stuck hold this dilemma for you and
started shooting up to the sky and this
is the reason behind it to dip by at
this area and it is possible to get this
kind of entry because you know the stuff
has a high possibility to bounce from
this support you can use this low as
your you haven't thirty you can use this
1130 as your as your risk and dip by all
wrong is you don't know I think it's
around 11:40 so now the stock for most
of the time on this heavy bond style he
squeezed around sixty percent but this
one squeezed even more so that really
tell you to stock is really overextended
because he squeezed a lot of short
sellers inside and and the balance
points not MIT it's not MIT like the
stuff way by itself so once the stock
hits at 20 a and start goes going red
sorry on the day and we're super a
completely read around I think I'm on
Wednesday that's the signal once you
correct a supporting me show you a
closer chart so once you're starting
cracking this support and this kind of
line this is the signal to tell you okay
the stock it's down and find the bounce
too short because double top
consolidating breaks consolidating
that's a really bearish trend especially
I'm really overextended stocks so if the
stock has double top consolidating end
of the day start cracking that's very
first ensuring you bound
I sure insurer showing weakness
especially for very very variable
extending stocks I'd never become men
shooting to witness on the first screen
day so don't show don't shorten to that
and add into strands on the bounce so I
think my average is are I showed it
around this crack around this 2022 area
adding to the bounce and just I just
write it out alone because most because
longer scenes and we're over spinning
stops I think I mentioned on Twitter
this one will go to 15 or under 20
actually 11 I didn't tell about that one
and for most model for a company like
their market cap are over 200 meeting
and 300 million 500 million this
sometimes the most of the time has some
kind of foundation so they won't drop
80% 90% of the time but they will bounce
so when the stock already meet that kind
of balance point you do want to get out

what's up guys Steven ducks here today I
want to talk about haer MV s pn p SP am
very very real market cap low flow and
we are shorting into the resistance I
would say risking that five dollar area
risking that four point five and
understanding that when the stocking
started slowly grinding and there's no
reward because there's support
everywhere support at too important for
support at reporting to support AG for
daughter area so we are shooting try to
get those 20 cents 30 cents that five
percent 3 percent reward understanding
your risk because even though there is
decent amount of resistance there surely
into it's still really dangerous because
there is no reward short squeeze can't
happen really easy like this morning you
shall hold it around or 75 after was
when action when mountains 4.1 area I
thinking it's gonna squeeze a little bit
more but this huge Kendall got stuffed
as you can see this almost 500k and
Turkish air traded and get him and going
nowhere so when you see a big volume
underneath and the price didn't even
change that means the selling volume is
very very high and when you're going
long you see that come on Kendall you
typically do not want to keep going on
that's probably the signal you wanna
sell aka our human parabolic on Friday
and there's no resistance you can risk
off in a long-term chart is training
massive amount of volume I am looking
for the continuations on Monday if he
caps up that'd be great because the
charts train brand new fresh volume very
very heavy so the resistance is gonna be
very very happy too
and as a short sellers keep this on your
watch list and once you get sort of
extended and creates mass and money
creates massive volume of back odors
that's where you want to start getting
in and I write stuff rights the downside
of this in the same parabolics now a TOI
now also I'm going to talk about a TOS
sorry I'm a bit sick today and you went
from 30 cents to almost $1 and there's
resistance for you to risk all which is
around 1.5 there's one about run dollar
in this area so either you can rescue
this 93 cents or the 1.5 seems like
people are shooting risky now now 93
cents as myself I don't like to sure
under $1 stock because that's down my
style and the Commission's are fairly
expensive shorting low price to stop
because you have to care a lot of shares
and we can get a lot of shares you trill
a lot of shares there's going to be a
lot of commissions so when the trade is
not there don't place any trades even
though for a week even though for a
month because you don't want to get a
rush into the stock market you do want
to be patient you don't want to wait for
the right setups to make that good 20 30
%
and that's it for guys thank you very
much for today you guys have a great day

so today I want to do a recap of the
entire month what happened in May and
April so the overall Market is changing
a little bit compared to the last year
of 2022. so uh let's go through pretty
much all of the major Runners how the
last couple weeks this is one thing I
want to talk about is most of the
tickers that were trading recently are
really crowded and that's number one
number two they are really easy to get
shares to borrow so this is a very
similar situation as compared to 2021
when Market was on drug with the
stimulus money now this is a completely
different Gap up short first of all but
we want to pay attention to the range
which extended from three to five so the
stop pushed to about 6.5 Consolidated no
more than one hour so this is one of the
things that when the stock is very
crowded always wait for consolidations
don't ever try to show Orange the
terrible push they are not worth it

hello guys team next here welcome to
this video so today I want to do a recap
of the entire month what happened in May
and April so the overall Market is
changing a little bit compared to the
last year of 2022. so uh let's go
through pretty much all of the major
Runners how the last couple weeks and
let's get into it so the first one we
have is MMD this one it was a gap
offshore but it had a weird I would say
actions after the momentum shift so this
is one thing I want to talk about is
most of the clickers that were trading
recently are really crowded and that's
number one number two they are really
easy to get shares tomorrow so after a
few tickers like this what happened on
UCR what happened on MLB I have some of
the I would say tips to share with you
guys especially when you're running into
the tickers that was very very crowded
in the pre-market right aftermarket open
how to really identify if it's a gap up
short or not so the first one we have
which is MMB this one I believe is easy
to borrow I think was a couple of cents
a share you went from one to four so the
extension range is also very sufficient
so whenever you are seeing a ticker
that's a low flow gives you the borrow
and with crowded volume always pay
attention to I would say shares the
bottom and how much range do they
perform after the market open so it
extended about 400 compared to the
yesterday's close so that's I would say
sufficient enough range to be able to
sure if the stop it's easy to borrow if
it's hard to borrow then the range can
be a little bit less also while you want
to focus on the ticker that's above
three dollars so majority of the Gap hop
short when you WCB stick tappers first
of all the Criterion has to be above 70
and if it's easier to borrow and crowded
I would recommend avoid those stickers
as much as possible if their bond
estimate is over 100 million so first
thing you want to estimate the volume
which you want to wait for at least an
hour a half an hour if the stock is
really crowded if it trades over 10
million before the market open so this
is a very similar situation as compared
to 2021 when Market was on drug with
their stimulus money so the volume is
very crowded so the age doesn't really
come until after 10 30 or 11 o'clock and
that's very crucial for you to wait
after the market open especially for the
crowded trades so pay attention to the
pre-market volume number two is you want
to wait for a consolidations but
sometimes consolidation does not work it
does not work on biotics it does not
work if the stock trades over 70 million
shares in before 11 o'clock and most of
the feeding percentage if the stock
tends to get really crowded either
they're gonna only fade 50 or they
cannot do bounces up and down up and
down so it's much better to be able to I
would say scalp instead of wait until
the close if you want to take some
profits when stock is panicking you want
to add into the push after a bounce then
however by the end of the day typically
it's the 50 Mark the ticket profits then
add and pull closed captioning not
available
[Music]
extended all the way up to the Eight
dollar each area and Consolidated about
an hour and it went through the
consolidations so personally for me I
would probably short into the
consolidations which I did I took a loss
into this consolation breakout after
that I took a little short better close
and closed by the end of the day so
these type of Gap up short first of all
they completely went through the average
pushing percentage of kept up short
which is around 20 to 25 percent so once
the stock breaks its average statistics
it's not a gap up short anymore so it
doesn't fit that Gap I'm sure it's
sufficient enough pushing person you
wouldn't be on that so uh typically it
happens on a microflow but it doesn't
really happen I'll take your trades I
think it was a three to five million
float and it was relatively easy to
borrow as well so it's also a couple
cents a share and either the borrow
takers you always wait until the stock
extended at least two to three hundred
percent before the afternoon shorting to
it when the bomb really gets crowded
it's very difficult to be able to to aim
for taptic so you don't have the top
tick wait until the consolidations and
to see and evaluate how much extension
did it get did it again and how much
longer they trade before you jump in 30
and if it's trading way too much long
let's say 100 million before noon hits
then uh make sure it's sizing small or
do not trade that thing at all now going
into the second day of ucar this one
gapped up into the second day and it
went to 15 went all the way down to 11.
so from here this one did qualify as a
multi-divander and the problem is I
thought about shorting around 15 I was
waiting for consolidations or either
form a massive consolidations or dollar
problems I didn't and the support is
right underneath of around 10 to 11 ish
so typically when you want to cover your
position you do want to cover a little
bit above the support and which is
around 12 12 ish if you're shooting
around 15 and three dollar reward that's
not really good reward so in terms of
showing into ucar into the second and he
was also crowded before 10 30. so in
terms of the entire day I didn't really
touch this thing this ticker at all I
don't think in on the risk of War part
it's not really worth it in terms of the
free market action I think it's worth it
short because it shows some weaknesses
before the market opened so that's the
two main tickers that happened last week
and make sure track I would say how much
following did they trade before 10 30.
how much fun did you trade into the
consolidations how much following did
how much dollar they traded before the
momentum shipped those are the key
factors to be able to pay attention to
the I would say very special policy
factors that happened in the last two
weeks and those 100 million long days
they do not happen almost in the last
year so make sure track your statistics
and when volume is very crowded
typically there's more Edge to I would
say to catch and there's more profits to
be made so just be able to adapting to
the outside current market conditions is
very important all right guys that'll be
it for this video and thank you very
much for watching uh if you have any

the most insane taker that happened in
the last two weeks which is top and mngl
top when pretty much fully parabolic
this is a pretty recent IPO going up on
the first green day typically on the
first Green Day of IPO you shouldn't be
even trading it especially going short
megl is the sympathy play of top going
to the first Green Day look like he's
about to do a consolidation breakdown
while top is going up so whenever a
sympathy probably looks really heavy and
the main player looks really strong uh
when the main play tends to lose its
momentum it typically some particularly
loses more momentum compared to the
major play

hello guys team Ducks here welcome to
this video So today we're going to talk
about uh one of the pretty much the most
insane taker that happened in the last
two weeks which is top and mngl
following with a bunch of the sympathy
play there's going to be a lot of
technical analysis involved this in this
video so make sure pay attention to it
and let's get into the video so uh the
first one we have top this one when
pretty much fully parabolic now before
top we had a very slow market now going
into the entryway level let's take a
look at the long-term chart this is a
pretty recent IPO going up on the first
green day typically on the first Green
Day of IPO you shouldn't be even trading
it especially going short so I did heard
about a lot of people trying to short
into the consolidations including me as
well I think I shorted it going to the
first Green Day shorted around 19 added
around 18 and cover around 19 before
close so I dodged this entire squeeze to
all the way up to 250 and then after
open I think I took a short around 1 10
120 risking the little consolidations
right here but it didn't already go as I
expected I took a decent loss into this
parabolic and they didn't really place a
tray right after that because uh you
know the wind landed around 250 as a
double top compared to the pre-market I
think it's a decent short uh by shorting
around 250 adding into the bounces and
covering while it's going down but
overall in the sticker are not very
confident because I have not seen a
ticker that losses 75 percent of its own
game the pre-market came all the way
back to test the pre-market high so and
this is definitely an exception it is a
low flow but it's not like extremely
micro float so I wasn't expecting this
one push you know from 50 to
256. and uh and same thing going in with
megl this is what I took a lost song as
well I'm going to go through my thinking
process megl is the sympathy play of top
going to the first Green Day or right
about here this this sticker actually
Gap through the resistance so it was
looking really heavy aftermarket open
and also it was looking really heavy
into the consolidations it looked like
it's about to do a consolidation
breakdown while top is going up so
whenever a sympathy player looks really
heavy and the main player looks really
strong uh when the main play tends to
lose its momentum it typically simply
loses more momentum compared to the
major play so megl it was doing some
weird behaviors in level 2 so I took
small positions I think was around 3.7
the first Spike right about here it
didn't really scare me out because right
after opening did a massive stuff I'm
going going all the way back to 330 but
it turns out you recovered always going
again and squeezed above that forward
70. that's where I come in losses I
think I took a decent loss in those two
tickers all together because I did not
expect uh ticker come comes all the way
back test a pre-market resistance I
think even though if I caught the double
the top in the midday and will not hold
this one overnight so if I'm shorting
around 5 30 I will probably not hold
this one overnight and probably be end
up covering around 4 to 450 ish so the
total gain on Mejo maximum will be
around 20 to 25 percent not exactly a
very reward but it does involve tons of
risk this is the one that I took two
losses
um but not on the major squeeze going
from 18 to 250. I think I showed it
around 120 covered around 140. couldn't
really get out into the halt but came
out with a decent loss and then covered
it and go into the next switch so those
are the major play that happened and
ever since after 2 pm in GTL there's
tons of money flowing back into the
market because people make money on top
thinking there's going to be the next
top squeeze happening in the next couple
days but all the detectors faded at 90
from the top now going into the back
side of top I did Place ashore when it
when it did a massive Panic going to the
80s I covered around 60s because I
thought there were some support right
about here 40 to 60 but it went you know
but in fact it went all the way back
down to to 10. so there wasn't any
consolidation to risk of there wasn't
any support to risk off and the only
support right here is about 15 to 16 but
you know it went through that support as
well so this chart doesn't really have a
really good Edge other than shorting
around this double double top and if
you're not shooting around just double
top and then shortening into the bounces
risking 250 that's about 20 30 risk not
really worth it Jordan top the only HIC
is a 250 ish but I don't think anybody
can wait all the way to 250 before it
plays ashore and I'm not taking loss on
it so that sound TLP and megl and after
that you've produced tons of bound short
one bound short right here going to two
70s and one bunk short today going to
290s those two about short can make this
amount of money cover Powershell the
losses back into short around 80
covering around 60. for me covered major
of my losses on those two hyped up
ticker but there is a lot to learn
especially on those two day Runner
whenever you see a taker go in a massive
parabolic growing up a couple thousand
percent in one day always expecting
there's a push after market open the
same thing that didn't really happen
after American open it was cxa AI so
that one was I was giving people the
wrong reference to show you know into
the pushes after American open always be
careful with the low float and always be
very selective especially when you see a
major play going a couple thousand
percent there's plenty of edges going to
come into the markets can't wait for
either balance Shore because these type
of takers can always come back and test
the resistance and that's the Easy Money
found there going in in the front side
especially when the stock is getting
long and going parabolic and those are
the most dangerous moments for shorting
so always tend to wait for a
consolidation then going to this week's
recap for PA and CW this one is also a
very similar chart compared to FRC FRC
did a dip came all the way back and
parabolic in in the morning I thought
you you know once the consolidation
stops around pacw it's going to break
down but instead came all the way back
and break suit consolidations that's
where common losses and they traded the
balances right here so surely around 570
cover around 580. so those are the two
launches that took on pacw one thing to
learn is I'll probably need to wait a
little bit longer consolidations on
these type of high volume High market
cap type of tickers because FRC did
consolidate about three two to three
hours before it actually shifts its
momentum so also the gaining percentage
I think at first it went from 10 to 50
so the gaining percentage from the ball
into top is about 500 percent this one
only gained about 100 so those are the
small details that I need to pay
attention to in the future for pacw
going to today you gapped up in the
morning and there is pretty much no Edge
to shore you know unless showing right
at open I don't think it's very ideal
because you have a support around six
typically you want to cover before a
support so we'll be 6.5
6.2 ish not very ideal in terms of
shorting as a mode today rounder we'll
see how it goes tomorrow if it gaps down
then there's pretty much no opportunity
anymore but uh if it comes back up and
tends to go parabolic again formal
consolidations that would be a great
opportunity to short and other than that
we have a lot of tickers to go through
one thing no no to cover an OMH now this
ticker it looks very similar to v i b c
i g the last two weeks you are seeing
tons of tickers going from 7 to 40 and 6
to 30 and phase in after hour don't
trade into these double holds and these
double tickers when they go up
significantly there's always people
getting trapped into those halts there's
always a bounce coming in the next week
or two forming a consolidations then
breaks down so those are very easy
tickers to short and shorting to the
front side it's not very ideal always
wait until the stock gives you a edge
either form consolidations or give you a
decent risk to risk call because
recently all those IPO takers can go up
thousands of percent in one day it
doesn't really matter about the flow
doesn't really matter about the market
cap those are the fresh chart and very
dangerous to short if you have any
questions please leave a comment below
and there's going to be a monthly recap
on the account statements next video so
I will see you guys in the next one

hello guys here and welcome to this
video So today we're gonna go over the
yearly monthly accounts demand review
and we're gonna go over the biggest
mistakes and the biggest game other than
that uh make sure to check the new
course in the Kim bio let's get into the
video
so let's look at the count statements in
terms of monthly profit January February
I made 100K and 40K then 400k on March I
was traveling the first two months of
the year so it wasn't very active in
February I think we made a mistake on
osea overall let's take a look at the
biggest mistake let's go over the
biggest losers the lcea went all the way
up to 26 I had the balance short over
here
short into resistance March 9th was
shorting around 9 60 and the resistance
was pretty big pretty dense around
here let's take a look at February 23rd
we have seen the consolidation between
12 to 16. so when the stock went up to 9
to 10 it was actually shortable in terms
of shorting into consolidations uh right
about here
um turns out or you squeezed all the way
back up so I was trolling it into the
strength of 970 adding into the bounces
and cutting losses again and then cut
losses again right here the size was
pretty big and it was about to try out
one trial around into this rejection
with actual size when trial with
rejections right here as well then
finally exit around here it wasn't a
great trade because I have noticed that
the volume is going to overwhelm the
historical resistance so in terms of
that it's not really ideal anymore so I
shouldn't be even holding throughout the
day that's mistakes on my part should
have only traded in the first fail and
if it tends to break through and test
distance again I should not trade this
anymore the biggest scan which will be
FRC which is the bank stock this one I
had we pulled about 60 percent I was
trading it day by day so let's look at
March 13th profits added up through this
month on FRC the first month was
starting around here and up all the way
to 50 Consolidated it showed it around
48 covered around 37ish since they
formed a massive consolidations uh
dollar block on one billion dollar was a
one billion dollar initial camp and
currently it's around 3.6 billion I
would believe overall it traded at
around 50 50 million before it cracked
down it's about a total of three billion
in terms of dollar block I'll show it
again into this push cover around 30
since it showed a massive weaknesses in
the pre-market pushed all the way back
test the resistance so it was small size
around there came all the way back
squeezed all the way to 40 since they
tested support So What a little bit long
around 20 so around 236 actually around
this day since it cracked all the way to
11. then I shot into the bounces and
covered around 12. so that's the four
trade on FRC and after that so someone
says playing left and right it's trading
solid amount of volume so with
liquidities it's actually worth it to go
in the size
especially whenever you are trading
something like this that has actual
fundamentals the current ongoing banking
crisis a lot of people are withdrawing
their deposits from the bank according
to the government bounce uh so they can
get four or five percent in short-term
bonds but the banks are only paying one
one percent maximum so that's why the
banks are losing deposit losing
inequalities and if they have too much
exposures in the market then they're
likely to get left out so the banking
stocks this is just the first one FRC
we're gonna have more to come so these
type of patterns will repeat again and
again
and that's what FRC currently the most
profitable trade so far in the year
biotech's always a nightmare so even
though with IPOs which I could win over
in the last videos three I went over the
Ura even over the perfect conditions and
consolidation still didn't work so I
would suggest do not show in the biotics
even though they have really attractive
consolidations and resistance now you're
not worth it alright guys a bit thank
you very much for watching this video
make sure to leave a comment below if
you have any questions I will see you

shorting underneath the resistance is
not a bad idea but the range that I
created today is very close to 50
percent as we know that when we are
shown into resistance the minimum range
that needs to be created it has to be 50
so this one has just met the minimum
criteria second whenever you are looking
at Too Short into a resistance you don't
want the volume to exceed and the
resistance volume right you traded about
20 mini shares before the momentum shift
which is on this candle the volume
itself already overwhelms the resistance
volume which we look at right here will
be around 14 15 million but whenever
this long is overwhelming it's cheap
borrows and you barely miss the minimum
range

the volume is definitely picking up
compared to 2022 I want you to get ready
in the upcoming months every single hype
actions is going to be very similar
compared to the last week actions so the
only way to be able to avoid traps is
you have to wait until the stock forms
consolidations to see how much volume
actually traded before 10 30. going
right here typically you can consider
this one as a gap up short a gapped up
over 100 typically when you see these
type of 20 to 30 pushing percentage
after open if they trade more than 40 or
50 million volume and the stock is not
going down it's holding the
consolidations majority of the time
we're going to see a breakout later on
in the afternoon or
right after 10 30.

hello guys here and welcome to this
video So today we're gonna go over uh
all of the AI plays that happened last
week the volume is definitely picking up
compared to 2022 there's going to be 10
takers we're gonna go over I happened in
one day I want you to guys to get ready
in the upcoming months every single hype
actions is going to be very similar
compared to the last week actions and
I'm also going to go over some of the
risk management method especially
trading those low floaters how to really
avoid the massive traps before that make
sure to check out the new course linking
below and let's get into the video first
let's talk about cxai this is the one
that's the main play that I consider the
drove the main volume into the market
Checker is only one million floats so
it's considered to be a nano float going
from 2 to 70 in the pre-market I'll go
into the first day since this is a now a
biotech so the only way to be able to
avoid traps is you have to wait until
the stock forms consolidations to see
how much longer you actually traded
before 10 30. going right here on tip
whether you can consider this one as a
gap up short it gapped up over 100
percent started around 1.3 so opened
around three so gapped up around 100
pushed about 30 in total consulted
around uh 3.3 typically when you see
these type of 20 to 30 pushing
percentage after open if they trade more
than 40 or 50 million volume and the
stock is not going down it's holding the
consolidations majority of the time
we're going to see a breakout later on
in the afternoon or
right after 10 30. so this one looked
really strong broke through the
consolidations I took a little short
right about here 3.3 I'll cover the
instantly when it broke around 3.6 so I
only took I think it was around 3K
losses then um didn't trade after that I
should have gone long once the 3.5 is
broken typically when the stock create
that much volume on a really low float
you will see either a significant
parabolic or a massive drop right before
the market closed into a consolidation
so I'm gonna go over that type of
scenario as well for cxai it's a nano
float went from going into the second
day when the stock is going fully
periodic like this so it's considered to
be closed really strong and going to the
next day the stock went all the way to
70. before the market opened the stock
opened around 20 so go in in from here I
I do consider this as the main play but
after market open this one already
dropped 70 80 from the top in terms of
managing your risk it's pretty pretty
much impossible the main consolidations
in the pre-market is around 29 so if the
Market opens and pushes to 29 there's a
rent you can risk of between 29 to 36.
to be able to size in into the stickers
it's going to be really difficult
tightening at the open you will never
know how far it's going to push because
low floaters can push can go all the way
up to 50 or even 60. without
consolidations don't touch these type of
low floaters always focus on the
sympathy play so going into the simply
play we have two tickers one is Sai this
one is I would say copying cxai is pre
obviously aftermarket opens action you
can see right off the bat
six AI dropped about 50 everybody's
seeing the main major plays dying then
everybody's not going to be confident
holding in the parabolic spikes right
off the market open for the sympathy
play this is a decent short trading
around six probably risking 7.4 adding
into the consolidations adding it into
the crack this one surprised me that it
didn't fully drop to the max reward
range typically these type of tickers
can fade all the way back to three this
is considered to be the max reward
Revenge since every AI sector closed
really weak I'm expecting that next
Monday clearly is likely to drop it's
not going to exceed Friday's volume and
this is likely to fade to three going
into ptpi this is another sympathy play
compared to cxai the only bad thing
about this one is this is a healthcare
related so it's considered to be a
biotech insane parabolic aftermarket
open went from one to eight this is also
a low floater the only way to be able to
trade this is ensuring into the
consolidation right here risking 8.5
since we traded around 75 million shares
I think before the momentum shifted
there's a good chance that going into
the next Monday this is unlikely to
trade more than 75 million shares for it
to break 8.5 typically the average
volume on a low floor is around 20 30
million and if on the current day you
only traded at 20 to 30 million shares
there's going to be a high chance that
into the next day it's likely to trade
30 to 40 mini shares but if it's trading
70 80 million shares which is the
maximum amount of volume can be traded
in intraday there is going to be a
really low chance to get more volume
going into the next day going forward in
ptpi I think that this drop is kind of
predictable but more predictable part
going into Monday is typically when
ticker trades this much amount of value
owners are likely to be a bounce that's
going to come after Monday ideal
consolidations is around I'll say 6.6
that's the middle of the consolidations
if it only trades about 10 million
shares in the at the open I'll probably
take some short positions around six
we'll see how it goes if it can form a
decent consolidations all right so uh
that'll be pretty much all the major
play there's tons of tickers that's
happening but it's not trading nearly as
much volume compared to SAI and ptpi
going into next week we have cnsp this
is also I would say the first Green Day
and I trades this much this much volume
also low floater and also a biotech and
be really careful with the biotech plays
tend to avoid as much as possible unless
they create a massive amount of
extension within two days so let's say
for cnsp it goes from 60 cents or 70
cents to 10 on Monday then yeah it is
shortable but if it's only up a couple
hundred percent typically biotechs are
now really worth it to show it into
always make sure manage your risk up to
really really tight that's how you can
avoid the massive squeezes just like
cxai alright guys that'll be off the
recap for the last week let me know if
any questions please leave a comment
below other than that see you guys next
week

always a gamble that this one could get
up in a second day because that type of
consolidation breakdown does not
indicate that momentum is going to shift
typically uncrowded one with
consolidation breakdown there is about
50 50 chance if it doesn't lose 50
percent from the top it can perform
either Gap up or a gap down it really
depends on how much volume traded on the
current day for MMB if the stock
performs a large amount of range after
market open as well as it's not a
biotech I think it's doable after the
stock pushes and consolidates then it's
okay to aim for momentum shift so always
pay attention to how much range that
stock has created always pay attention
to the volume if the stock trades over
10 million shares in the pre-market be
very careful because majority of the
time you're running into a first screen
date and a gap up shooter so majority of
the time that you will get squeezed on
another screen day

hello guys team Ducks here welcome to
this video so today let's go over some
of the Gap up short not about short most
recent Gap up shore I would say the
statistics has not changed yet so I'm
gonna go over some of the psychologies
of the shorter Setters and the buyers as
well for the reason to mount I think
it's going to be really helpful going to
playing all these patterns in the next
half of the Year other than that let's
get into the video so the first one that
we have is vicg let's compare with The
Gap Hub percentages first the most
recent three Gap option we have is ipx
mmv and vicg now let's talk about the
first thing that we want to focus is it
has to meet the qualifications of Gap
upshore so market cap and flow first one
we have is initial market cap is under
100 million I believe the full is around
3 million to 5 million on MMD the other
one we have is ipx this one is also an
IPO I know history is on the chart MMB
also an IPO but it did have a history on
the charity faded all the way down let's
keep all that in mind we have b-i-cg
knits not the first time has ground yet
but it has round before so the only
clean chart we have is ipx compared to
viscg and MMD and those are the
differences and they have very similar
marking gaps and Float now let's get
into the intraday so the first one we
have is uh MMD it gapped up about I was
at 250 percent pushed exactly about 30
percent it had its weird up and down
consolidations once your craft has lost
its momentum it went all the way down
faded about 75 percent from the top
starting from four all the way to two so
the total range is about 75 percent then
believe let's take a look at it the
total 13 is starting from four so let's
put a mark right there range started
around I'll say when it's pretty one 75
yep exactly 75 on the first Gap up short
and the balance in the second day then
open The Faded again so going to the
second day I don't think it's really
worth it to short around 2.4 since it
hasn't bounced enough typically you want
to wait until at least goes around three
before shooting into uh consolidations
by using the resistance that formed from
yesterday then we have the icg this one
ran before so let's take a look at the
intraday chart the first one we had is
starting from 2.6 opened around 3.8 so
the total spiking percentage is about 70
percent from yesterday remember MMD
opened above 200 the icg opened around
70 so that doesn't fit a purifications
of Gap upshore and once you see the
consolidation that was formed the
difference between B icg and MMB this
one actually cracked whether this one
greased up another two three hundred
percent uh all the way from the bottom
squeeze all the way to 11 we're from 300
percent from the bottom and this one
doesn't really have any resistance let's
take a look got the May 2nd the
resistance that was formed before
doesn't have any type of consolidations
so not typically when you see a ticker
that I ran before doesn't have any
consolidations you cannot use this one
as a resistance candle also the volume
is overwhelming so this one has to be a
fresh chart no actual very solid
resistance one thing you want to pay
attention is if the stock opens less
than 100 I would say 75 percent and then
their branch is really tight shorting
into the morning push is not going to be
very ideal you can see this one pushed
all the way up so showing into
consolidation so it's going to be very
difficult trading these type of pattern
with really tight range on the Gap I'm
sure so that Gap up short criteria it
has to be the open price compared to
yesterday's close has to be at least a
hundred percent so on the icg those are
the difference between MMB and vicg now
going into ipx so we look at the
difference between admin B and bscg both
of MMD and the bscg uh ran before it's
not the first time they ran and ipx is a
completely fresh chart so let's take a
look at ipx which will be June 13th
first one we took a look at well on the
floor and market cap is it does qualify
the the criteria initial market cap
under 100 million now going to how it
opened so start around six opened at
nine so this is this one did not open
100 above yesterday's close so you
wanted to open the correctly it has to
open around 12. it didn't opened around
nine so this one does not fit the
typical Gap up short and you can see it
squeezed all the way up again starting
around nine when all the way to 18. so
this one doubled from the bottom we see
I drew tripled from the bottom and you
can see if the chart doesn't have a
history of its dropping 90 from the top
this one dropped 90 from the top ipx is
if it's on the fresh chart you can see
this one didn't really drop well there's
two things we can take from most recent
gappers first one is tire range at open
compared to yesterday's clothes if that
does happen always be patient wait for
consolidations if the stock doesn't have
a history of dropping 90 from the top or
didn't trade any type of volume before
no range was created it was pretty much
a flat chart then I would avoid the
first Green Day you can see majority of
the the consolidate and they don't drop
that holding over nine is pretty much a
gamble either a gaps up or gaps down I
wouldn't want Total overnight on this
type of fish chart now going into the
tickers that has tight cap up wrench and
crowded volume avoid those as much as
possible I would always avoid on the
first Green Day because once they form
consolidations it's hard to know they're
actually going to perform a mentorship
even though it performs momentum shift
and it cranks down you still don't want
to hold it overnight because first of
all it didn't fade at 50 found the top
this one only fitted about 40 and closed
I was pretty strong always a gamble that
this one could gupped up in a second day
because that type of consolidation
breakdown does not indicate the momentum
is going to shift typically uncrowded
one with consolidation breakdown there
is about 50 50 chance if it doesn't lose
50 percent from the top it can perform
either Gap up or gap down it really
depends on how much volume traded on the
current day for MMB if the stock
performs a large amount of range after
market open as well as it's not a
biotech I think it's doable after the
stock pushes and consolidates then it's
okay to aim for momentum shift so always
pay attention to how much French the
stock has created always pay attention
to the volume if the stock trades over
10 million shares in the pre-market be
very careful because majority of the
time you're running into a first screen
day then I Gap up sure so majority of
the time that you will get squeezed on
the first green day that will be all of
the gap of short or gappers in the last
couple weeks and hopefully you guys

hello guys team Ducks here welcome to
this video so today we are going to go
over my trade zero monthly statement
also we're going to go over some of my
mistakes and my gains to see what
lessons we can learn from it there's
also going to be my I would say self
recap for all those stickers that I
traded in the last two months and there
were some difficult tickers to trade
make sure click like button and
subscribe and let's get into the video
so you can see this is my 3-0 statements
in the last five months to forty three
thousand uh April was a loss a negative
164 000 I think this is meaning came
from the top and megl losses I think we
went over the first three months so it
was I would say a roller coaster ride in
the last three weeks so uh let's go over
on the profit losses by symbols I think
well we're gonna go over some of the
biggest losses when there were mptx and
pacw let's go over all the way to
January and we have a 97 000 Yen on asns
let's go over the biggest losses first
now first of all we have mbtx now OCA we
went through that then we have top those
are the two biggest gain the last three
months as you can see FRC is 360
000 on that one most recent games
um One games on asns and one losses on
Paco
and top let's go over a very specific
size for those three takers uh first one
will be a SNS and the total gain is
about close to 100 000 this is another
biotech so make sure avoid all of the
biotechs I can see and in the last
couple months because biotech has been
proven that it does not follow the
average pattern at all and those double
tickers are very difficult to trade so
going to as and this this one parabolic
very similar to OMH as of today and you
can see a couple days later it comes all
the way back and does um you know
semi-parabiotic and Tesla resistance
somehow formal consolidations and fade
all the way back down I think I took a
short around in 10 and it was a faked
out of this resistance added a little
bit more and went all the way back down
to four I'll cover the most of my shares
around five a little bit around four so
overall it was a decent and pretty good
trade and this has proven that don't
ever try to short in the first round of
a parabolic after reverse split or IPOs
always wait until it forms a bounces
formal consolidations then go ahead and
short from there it does produce much
higher Edge and also something to risk
of shooting around 10 risking 11. not
too bad then going into pacw it's a
volleyball losses
should be smarter because I took I think
it's around 70k 80k losses on pacw
didn't trade on the first Green Day
traded on the second day on mainly the
size day and around right here the size
was equal is pretty big I think assassin
around total of 100K shares around uh
480 added into this fake out I would say
fake down so either still 490 covered I
think is around 5 30. so this is the
first try out second try out shorted it
around six added into the bounces so 560
that's the very small size six right
there so average is around 570 covered
590 so another 100K shares I think total
is about 70k 80k losses I think that's
the two of the tryout that I did overall
as I said in the last video the
extensions should be more so it should
be around 500 at least starting around
240 usually stick on a 10 or 11 before
it's really shortable second I need to
wait for longer consolidations this are
only Consolidated for an hour the FRC
Consolidated for three hours so that's
the difference also FRC was a little bit
more expensive compared to pac-w so
those are the I would say major mistakes
I made I need to you know be more
disciplined about my analysis not the
entry in exit sometimes if you didn't
get it right it's not about your injury
and exit I think I did okay on entry and
exit I just didn't do well on the
overall obviously analysis on pacw
extension wasn't right consolidation
wasn't right that's for pac-w and we had
another loss and btx you can see this
year you know it wasn't very smooth
because sometimes the volume is very
extreme sometimes the volume is not
there at all so it's really hard to
adapt you know these type of marketing
conditions and you can see my losses and
gains you know sometimes they're really
big I have to really need to work on my
um my size especially because because
some of the Seekers are now worth
criticizing that much because even
though the stock can gain you know a
couple thousand percent but the equality
is just not there so I'll say as a
reminder for all the Traders out there
always be careful with how much your
sizing in never tend to break its own
liquidity because it's very difficult to
cover your shares that's number one
number two even though you are long
still make sure you pay attention to
your size nothing too big it's not very
good for you so out in btx pushed in the
morning Consolidated I think it took
ashore around the 540 at a 520 so my
average is around 520 to 540 with this
significant added again into into the
bounce and It reversed all the way back
I think I covered around 560. so that's
the first initial loss it took and you
faded all the way back down so this time
it's more of like Chase I chased again
into the 460 but with much smaller size
this one I did a much bigger size
because we were having a consolidation
so you have decent volume being trapped
in there but going into shooting around
460 you have a wide risk that's number
one the chart already performed a really
weird stuff in action so it's a red flag
right there so I did a very small size
and I think it covered around 540. so
that's a those are very smart right here
there's another attempt right here
overall it was a decent LSA risk
management but this is a healthcare
stock so whenever you are trading uh
you've been a biotech sometimes the
ticker has tons of warrants on ready to
convert still
very dangerous to trade and in a very
high chance to take a loss on it
finished with the consolidations going
to the next day if it is again there's
only one conditions that you can trade
biotechs is the extensions on two
consecutive days that needs to be at
least up about one thousand percent so
starting around two needs to go to 20.
then once you have that big of
extensions we can talk about a decent
pullback but for these type of tickers
with first Green Day never tend to short
it not very uh safe so those are a
Recaps of the most recent biggest skin
and biggest losses hopefully we can get
more plays in the upcoming month and the
market is definitely back it takes a
while to adapt but I think it's
manageable once after you get used to
the current market conditions so that'll
be all the Recaps for this week and if
you have any questions leave a comment
below and other than that I will see you
guys in the next one

hello guys team Knox here welcome to
this video so today I'm gonna go over a
couple of the outside chart patterns
that has changed in the last month I
have fixed some of the criterias for the
patterns as well this month pattern has
been very choppy also very messy there's
not many profitable place but let's take
a look into it let's get into the video
we had several of the balance Shore that
took her around into resistance but it
doesn't create a decent amount of range
so let's go over the first one which
will be top resistance will be at June
5th so you can see there is
consolidations between 9 to 950 going
into today Consolidated between I would
say 8 to 8 50. so shorting underneath
the resistance is not a bad idea but the
range that I created today is very close
to 50 percent as we know that when we
are shooting into resistance the minimum
range that needs to be created it has to
be 50 so this one has just met to
minimum criteria second whenever you are
looking at Too Short into a resistance
you don't want the volume to exceed and
the resistance volume right you traded
about 20 mini shares before the momentum
shift which is on this candle the volume
itself already overwhelms the resistance
volume which we take a look at right
here will be around 14 15 million so
volume is overwhelming the resistance
volume that's why I can see the stock
curves all the way back number one this
it's not very ideal showing that the
stock only emit the minimum criteria
second the borrow rate were very cheap I
think it's around one cents to two cents
a share number three the resistance
itself is not very solid only 14 minutes
you're traded I would say 10 million
shares traded in the consolidations the
total amount of dollar being traded on a
resistance it's around 90 million and we
traded about more than 90 million in
this consolidation this is one of the
obviously better examples because this
one actually cracked down when it ran
into resistance but whenever the stock
is the volume is overwhelming it's cheap
barrels and you barely missed the
minimum range take a look at the other
two back Shores so the first one we have
is ucar this is another bound short stop
running into resistance happened in June
21st first of all the stock rounds all
the way up to nine started around 550 so
very similar range compared to top it's
all went to 80 90 this one went the 919
so both of them uh expect about 50 you
can see that when the stock is very
cheap borrows and it's trading massive
amount of volume and you can see it did
not really drop by the end of the day
and the fading percentage on the pattern
itself is about 50 so whenever you are
shorting into those very tight range
bound Shore you always want to cover you
know before it has 50 if you top tick
and it's um I will say relatively
difficult to top tick if the stock is
going up on a strength and once it chops
around it's very difficult to manage
your size whenever you want to size it
and want to add after a momentum shift
your average typically gets draw down by
your adding size then taking your profit
it's going to be a very tight range and
not going to make much of the reward on
the chart another one we have which will
be OC a this one also had its bounce
shorts with about 40 mini shares in June
21st let's take a look at the May 23rd
resistance we have the consolidations
between around 10 to 12 go into the last
15 days to three minute chart so we know
that the resistance is around 10 May
23rd then we had another balance short
right here which will be June 21st the
range itself is between 5 to 8 so it's
only up about 40 on this one uh I was
hoping this one could come back and
squeeze a little bit but it seemed like
the resistance is a little bit too hard
so if the consolidation is around 10
then we're looking at about 400 million
460 million dollar being traded into
that resistance going into Shore today
but the problem is whenever you run into
these type of bound Shore the ranger if
the range is really low I wouldn't
really recommend surely into this type
of pattern because once the range it
goes below 50 there's only limit amount
of reward you have also this one's a
biotech as well biotech easy to borrow
low throw and tight range there you
always run into there's different
quizzes what one we had was top and then
we had this UC AR this one chopped
around OC it actually dropped those are
the three bounce shorts that we had in
the last couple days all of them
produced less than about 50 on the total
range all of them faded about 50 from
the top and the only one that didn't
fade which will be ucar and including
top as well going forward I would place
the range around 70 on the balance Shore
the minimum range under if the stock
tends to spike it has to be 70 once it
gets below 50 you're always looking at
the chart not going to be like this if
you didn't control your risk well if you
are likely to take a loss on these type
of patterns as well so might as well put
your range up higher and miss those
tickers and you can make a lot more
reward and much higher winning
percentage so you don't have to be mess
around with this chart and also taking
multiple entry and exit because it's
keep breaking out the 75 level of the
entire Panic right here so that'll be
the all the bound Shore going into the
next month first one you want to avoid
tight range which will be under 50
second you want to make sure counter
resistance if the current day volume is
overwhelming the resistance volume you
do not want to size too big number three
the minimum range has to be 70 and also
if the stock is on tire range and also
easy to borrow it's very easy you will
see a chart you know squeezes like this
so those are the points you want to pay
attention going to the next half of the
year that will be it for bound shorter

hello guys index here welcome to this
video so today I'm going to go over to
my trades that made me over 280 000 in
one day
[Music]
as you can see some of the AI stocks are
being really hot for this video we're
gonna talk about some of the technical
analysis and including my entry exit and
also some of the volume training as well
to make sure we are adapted to the
current market other than that check out
the linking below or the new courses and
let's get into the video alright so the
first one we have is gfai you can see
this one around 4 to 21 so overall up
about 500 percent this is a low floater
let's check out the historical chart
this one till the reverse play so all
these resistance becomes useless so it's
going to be a fresh chart overall and
let's check out the volume that was
traded before the momentum shifted total
traded volume is around 40 million so 40
million on the day before the momentum
shifted so right about here the stock
Consolidated between 14 to 16 the
consolidation range exceeded over 25
percent
didn't really put Triggers on this day
didn't touch it because the
consolidation is way too wide also the
volume is overwhelming and it's also a
fresh chart so I waited until the
following day and since it closed really
strong I was expecting this one to go to
uh 30 to 40. but it turns out it gapped
down so it's showing weaknesses in the
pre-market and also turned red typically
whenever you want to assure these type
of pre versus red day you want to check
out the support and resistance the
resistance was formed in the pre-market
since it's a low flow I was expecting
this one to push aftermarket open but
also I was a little bit hesitating to
short after the strength in the morning
because you can see there is some type
of support was formed before yesterday
which is 14 to 16. so I waited the push
shorted around 18 I was planning to add
around 19 and 21 to risk the 21.9 or
21.1 area the stock dumped so I added
into the bounces right here I was not
expecting this one to fade all the way
down but it turns out he cracked through
the support and Consolidated between
under the support level that was formed
yesterday so when the supporter gets
tracked through like this these type of
support becomes resistance following day
it faded
to a dollar the overall gaining
percentage is about 500 percent the
overall feeding percentage from the high
I was formed around 21 is 75 percent so
still following the average statistics
and now including biotech so um this is
the trade that I made sizing around
18 added around 17 average is close to
17.5 covered by the end of the day which
is 13. I was going to hold this trade
overnight since it didn't really Fade
Into the maximum trading percentage but
the overall Barrel fee was kind of
expensive I think it was around one to
two dollars a share overnight so it's
not really worth it and sizing in today
which the volume is really low so
overall the entire day only traded
around 1.8 million shares Max American
size 8 is probably 10K 10 000 and also
the float is between
1.2 to 1.4 that means you cannot
assassin over 100k shares because you do
not want to exceed 10 of the flow that's
the review for gfai then let's go over
mwg this is the ticker than happiness on
the same day as gfai first uh Green Day
through the 16 overall gaining
percentage is around 500 percent then
showed pre-market weaknesses and
I took a short around 11.5 I think the
first intro is around 12 then 11.5 left
it there I was expecting this one to go
to seven so I covered the most of my
shares around seven and the rest will be
around about four to five this is the
IPO play typically IPO play Fades a
little bit more compared to the average
reverse split and when it's trading on
low volume it also tends to fit much
more than usual since the line was
really low didn't really sizing too much
overall it's around 20K shares total
you can see the volume was not that much
it only traded around four mini shares
so try not to exceed a one percent of
the volume ten percent of the float and
the maximum concise in which will be 40K
in this day wasn't a bad trade total I
made around 180 then another 80k on mwg
all right guys that'll be the two
tickers review for probably this week if
you have any questions please leave a
comment below and other than that I will
see you guys in the next one

So today we're going to talk about the
recent runners in the last two weeks so
I selected about three to four plays for
you guys to take a look the one that was
tradeable was SLE which it did very
similar pre-market action faded about
75% then rep pushed and Consolidated
this one didn't push it started around
50% or 30% from yesterday's close so it
wasn't a very good play until it reaches
around 10 or 11 before it's shortable so
let's take a look at the most recent
Runner which will be Fem

first one let's talk about pwm are we
seeing this one one from 4 to 31. it's
trading on one million floats and the
reason why I didn't short this in the
very front side is whenever you are
shorting an IPO and a ticker was crowded
and that means he's trading more than 20
million shares or it rotates more than
15 times of its float throughout the day
back here actually more than 15 million
shares right here should be more than 15
minute shares the reason why I didn't
really short pwm first of all it was
easy to short second it's hard to find a
risk since the consolidation range is a
little bit too wide that took ashore
after it filled around 26.5 because
whenever a low flow is going parabolic
and it's on a decent amount of volume
never try to guess the top always wait
for some type of pullback or
consolidations before you add into size

hello guys team next here welcome to
this video so today I'm gonna talk about
how to really trade the follow-ups of
pretty much all of the recent IPOs this
month there is some tricks I want to
share with you guys so let's get into
the video so first one let's talk about
pwm and pretty much all the tickers that
we talked about last week there is about
five of them today first one will be pwn
uh we're seeing this one one from 4 to
31. it was traded on 1 million float and
the reason why I didn't short this in
the in the very front side is whenever
you are shorting an IPO and a ticker was
crowded and that means he's trading more
than 20 million shares or it rotates
more than 15 times of its vote
throughout the day back here trading
more than 15 million shares right here
trading more than 15 mini shares the
reason why I didn't really short pwn
first of all it was easily short second
it's hard to find a risk since the
consolidation range is a little bit too
wide which we talked about in the last
video and going in for yesterday's and
today there is two opportunities that
actually you can catch the first one is
the following balance short up in here
we have Little Resistance in the 20s and
shooting around 10 20 is not that bad I
took a Shore around 19 to 20 ish covered
around 15. the reason why I cover around
15 is if you take a look at yesterday's
close which is around 12. the range is
between 12 to 13 so typically you want
to cover around 20 above the neutralized
area which is around 12. I chose around
15 because that's 50 from the top and
they had to support it first you had its
support that was formed in very initial
of the spike and so I think I made 50k
around there and then go into today that
took ashore after he filled around 26.5
because whenever a low flow is going
parabolic it is on a decent amount of
volume never try to guess the top always
wait for some type of pullback or
consolidations before you add into size
so for today the correct action or our
own size age supposed to be a Powershell
around 26 because he's at the
consolidation then main size supposed to
be the rejection on the balance up
around here so 23.9 then add a little
bit more on 22 then cover into
yesterday's close which is around 18.
the total volume should about 9.2
million so maximum size you can size in
a sticker is around 100K 90k shares
highest volume is 300K so yeah around
60k to 90k shares the range itself it's
not too great so I don't recommend
sizing into the max size and you can see
that every ticker that went up
significantly recently always produced
some type of bands so that's pwn and
going to today hcti a couple days ago
heading right into the resistance around
six trade over 18 million shares against
the 30 million resistance this one is
also around 1.5 million votes took a
little bit short around I think it's
around six because they opened around
six monthly deciding to 660 ish cover
around four that was an easy short for C
hcti was a decent balance short those
two bouncer are a little bit different
pwn is more of multi-day balance short
it create a decent amount of range
testing a high of the resistance so this
is worth a short and it's CTI is one you
cannot show or into the second day so
when the ticker hammered into resistance
and fitted all the way back down
majority of the time the second day if
the ticker tends to spike again it's not
a short anymore but if it holds its game
it didn't drop it can be a short in the
second day so this is the difference
between pwm and hcgi now we have another
one which is gttc that happened this
last week and the major resistance is
around seven so right now we're at four
if it goes to seven we will be up about
70 80 percentish that will be something
that's worse ashore consolidations
around seven existence around 20 million
so if you trades more than 40 million
shares when it's heading to the
resistance and it's probably not a short
anymore the resistance volume is kind of
low around 20 million so be very careful
when a 2dtc bounce back what I noticed
that pretty much for all the biotechs
it's worth it to trade and if it sounds
very fresh IPO but if it have two years
of history and traded some type of
volume before more than 10 million then
it's now worth it to use the average
statistics under normal Gap up short
picture track your biotech statistics
because there's a difference between
IPOs and non-ipos that will be the three
major play for recently I would say
they're not too bad pretty predictable
the volume is stable as well and they're
all micro floats so it doesn't trade
that much volume but I'm very curious to
see that in the next couple months when
the market picks up again and we're
heading into a couple hundred million
volume in one day so we'll see how the
statistics performs but for now I'm sure
range of resistance IPOs works pretty
well so alright guys that'd be it for
this video thank you very much for

hello guys team next here welcome to
this video so today I want to go over
how to really be very selective with
your trades and most recently I was in
the last three months we are having at
least about 20 plays that's potentially
to be uh profitable so uh how to really
become very selective and also be able
to pick the right trades and not taking
unnecessary losses those are my personal
experience I want to share with you guys
after trading in the last two months
let's get into it so the first one we
have is
cjet and this one um it was IPO play and
the problem with IPO play is the
extension range most recently we had a
couple one is CWD one is
mgrm those stickers they all went
parabolic into the second day and they
all dropped pretty aggressively after
the momentum has shifted so for cjet
first of all total extension from I
would say four to eight and in the
morning it was trading is very
sufficient enough volume so this is
considered to be the first Green Day not
considered to be the second Green Day
and typically you do not want to shore
if the stock goes parabolic like this
and trades sufficient enough volume so
in the first I'll say an hour traded the
majority of the voluntary of 14 million
shares and it didn't really form any
type of uh top in the pre-market it
breaks through the top of the pre-market
Consolidated only for half an hour and
came modeling back down typically when
the stock gets crowded you should offer
a bounce back up to seven then ships by
the end of the day first of all is for
these type of Gap I'm sure they do not
qualify as a gap up short it went up on
the mark of 70 typically we are looking
to short IPO extension range has to be
much more aggressive that's number one
also believed cjet was relatively easy
to borrow as well so first of all you'd
only have a half an hour consolidations
second no pretty much the top that shows
you to be able to manage your risk the
only candle that potentially can be risk
of is the fake breakout around 840
shooting around 770 and risking 50 cents
on Eight dollar stock I think I don't
think it's very bad but it didn't really
show enough convictions not enough
consolidations number two the range
itself it's barely a hundred percent not
even 100 so that's why I didn't really
show this one turns out after the moment
it shifted typically you do want to
shoot into a bounce maybe bounce back to
750 seven dollar risk in 750. these are
a decent traits to be able to uh I would
say much easier to manage but for cjet
easy to borrow crowded not enough range
did not touch it that's for cjet then
we're gonna go ahead have frza now this
one was still scratching my head about
this one first of all we have resistance
that was formed in November I traded
about 50 million so that's a I would say
solid resistance up around 2.7 it
informed consolidation in that day so
it's really easy to spot the resistance
number two is you look at a rafter
Market open
they went through the resistance came
back all the way down to 250. I went
under the resistance that formed in
November majority of the time that if
the stock trades less than two dollars
and in trades I would say 70 to 80
million volume throughout the day their
fading percentage gets reduced to 50
instead of 75 which is around 1.6 and
came all the way back up to the 3.5
majority of the time whenever you are
shooting a balance Shore that's a
non-biotech play generally they fade
after former consolidation into this
fake out but it came all the way back
again around 3.2 so the overall chart
action it did not Spike really
aggressively but in terms of the price
action this one should have Faded by the
end of the day I guess the volume was
overwhelming so in the future wise if
the volume estimate doubles compared to
the resistance volume then the charge is
going to behave really weird future wise
that the pre-market bone estimate equals
twice as the resistance volume I would
be very careful picking your entry and
always wait for consolidations neither
do not try to shore aftermarket open
into those small push because if they're
crowded they always push about 20 to 30
percent after the market open compared
to the open price before the momentum is
Shifting to the downside then go ahead
tomorrow we have baos this one doesn't
have any type of resistance now I also
believe this is a micro flow as well
from the resistance around eight now
this is one of the charts you guys I
would say everybody is mistaken where
the resistance is so let me go through
the entire chart majority of the time
when whenever people are trying to find
the resistance to short they always pick
the ball in with the consolidations and
so let's say the stock shift its
momentum and it comes out there around
nine to eight these type of
consolidations they do not qualify as
resistance even for the ticker that's
truly sufficient at buying because they
are already faded enough it's above the
neutralize area that's the maximum that
can fade and whenever the stock comes
all the way back do not use that as a
resistance at all because typically when
the ticker goes up one thousand percent
and Fades 99 from the top majority of
the time that stock compacts really
aggressive because if you think about in
terms of to Trader psychology if the
stock loses 99 from the top and the only
people left it will be the very stubborn
buyers and they're not likely to sell
unless the stock goes to zero or gets
deleted so they are down 99 so what's
the difference between down 99 to 99.5
percent when the stock Fades 99 from the
top and those aggressive buyers becomes
you know the ultimate backholders and
they're willing to hold forever these
type of tickers do come back really
aggressively and does a bunch of short
squeezes before the momentum is Shifting
to the downside on bals I would be
really careful also it's a Chinese play
we just had TLP and I was very
manipulated going forward be very
careful with those low flow and IPO
tickers that Fades 90 from the top so
that'll be the recap for uh this week
let me know if you have any questions

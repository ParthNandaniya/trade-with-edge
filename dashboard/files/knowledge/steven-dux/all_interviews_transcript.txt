00:00:00.030 so we get dumped by someone you cannot
00:00:01.589 feel like not very confident so you want
00:00:03.570 to gain confidence back by cheating
00:00:04.890 something and the reason why a lot of
00:00:06.690 people think stock markets gambling
00:00:07.980 because they don't have a specific
00:00:08.910 strategies and we have about two
00:00:11.460 schooling that is over two million
00:00:12.719 already welcome back to another episode
00:00:22.380 of off the peel podcast
00:00:23.500 [Music]
00:00:27.120 all right today we got David in the
00:00:29.790 moderator seat we got I don't know why I
00:00:31.890 started dancing this right next to me
00:00:34.020 I'm Ryan and we have a very special
00:00:37.320 guest and also for the first time ever
00:00:39.600 all a sponsor of today's podcast mr.
00:00:42.210 Steven Ducks he's young 25 25 years old
00:00:46.770 like just very recently who basically
00:00:49.770 turned $27,000 correct me if I'm wrong
00:00:52.770 yeah into four million before the age of
00:00:54.629 24 and you're 25 right now 25 right so
00:00:57.210 five million dollars yeah so five-minute
00:00:59.489 dollars in well when did you start start
00:01:03.300 when I was 19 officially that is
00:01:05.220 critical in five years basically five
00:01:07.229 six years million bucks a year for
00:01:08.970 something like that summer it a good
00:01:10.560 yeah and that's why I'm intrigued but
00:01:14.640 but just just because I've kind of
00:01:16.320 butchered your whole story and what you
00:01:17.759 actually do I'll let you explain it okay
00:01:20.340 so it's gonna be a little bit different
00:01:24.180 and compared to other stock brokerage
00:01:26.520 not a lot of structure here is Apple
00:01:28.860 [Music]
00:01:30.649 Tesla Amazon's all those stocks or
00:01:33.750 options that guys here pretty much all
00:01:35.759 the time not a TV but what I specialized
00:01:38.880 I trade is the stocks are have a lot
00:01:42.660 lower market caps which it means the
00:01:46.950 stock worth a lot less compared to
00:01:48.959 Amazon's and smaller ones smaller
00:01:51.539 companies right and I'm just just as a
00:01:54.119 disclaimer for everyone out there and
00:01:55.500 and for you Stephen we're gonna have to
00:01:58.920 have you dumb this down a lot for us
00:02:01.050 because we're not experienced in this
00:02:02.610 world so even just what you just said
00:02:04.110 yeah I'm like kind of following well
00:02:08.160 we'll ask you though okay so you do you
00:02:10.800 deal with more like smaller stocks and
00:02:12.390 not like the big company the big
00:02:13.709 companies exactly that so what does that
00:02:15.000 mean exactly when you're saying you're
00:02:16.440 you trade ok so there's about three
00:02:18.959 sections of what I typically categorize
00:02:22.020 all the market caps so three sections
00:02:24.330 one is billion dollar cap which you
00:02:26.280 includes Amazon's and Tesla's or all the
00:02:29.459 bigger companies then after that we
00:02:31.920 follow with under 1 billion so will be
00:02:34.500 anywhere around 500 million to one bit
00:02:36.930 in this category is called mid cap so
00:02:40.379 that
00:02:40.819 little companies and kind of big are not
00:02:43.859 roofs with an example of one of those um
00:02:46.489 that's a kind of big company they most
00:02:50.280 of them are biotechs so they're making
00:02:52.349 medicines okay
00:02:53.700 testing their drugs and getting through
00:02:56.640 free one first two and then finally get
00:02:59.730 their FDA approval so majority the
00:03:02.129 stocks are sometime there's all types of
00:03:04.920 right types of stocks you can't be valid
00:03:07.829 tax it can be technology companies and
00:03:09.510 stuff like that and after that we follow
00:03:12.780 with anywhere between twenty million to
00:03:15.659 100 million so that's where I trade
00:03:18.090 that's considered small that's
00:03:20.220 considered small yeah is there anything
00:03:23.010 smaller than that like yes there is some
00:03:25.590 of company only worth about two million
00:03:27.090 to 10 million and they're in the stock
00:03:29.129 market yes buy and trade you can buy and
00:03:31.290 trade they're typically Nasdaq and the
00:03:33.989 bigger companies are there in your
00:03:35.250 exchange then if there's a lot of
00:03:38.189 smaller companies there will be in Pink
00:03:40.200 Sheets so just three have you heard
00:03:42.269 about pink sheets from the wolf of Wall
00:03:44.699 Street yes pink sheets are very sketchy
00:03:46.930 [Laughter]
00:03:49.519 they made the movie yeah okay so
00:03:52.949 generally when you hear about pink
00:03:54.540 sheets are pretty much garbage companies
00:03:56.849 and there's that back in twenty sixteen
00:03:59.879 twenty fifteen or a little bit early or
00:04:01.590 twenty twelve there's a lot of people
00:04:04.049 are pumping dump the stock so they're
00:04:06.479 sending out all types of emails saying
00:04:08.099 all this that's gonna go up and very
00:04:10.139 similar to awful Wall Street and except
00:04:12.449 they're doing the emails instead of
00:04:13.919 phone calls and now that people just buy
00:04:15.419 the stock and the instead ofwell dump
00:04:17.608 the stock and all the investors lose
00:04:19.079 money so the pumping means that a lot of
00:04:21.810 they get a lot of different people to
00:04:23.520 buy the stock and then the stock price
00:04:24.810 goes up up up up up yeah and then they
00:04:26.940 all sell it because other people are
00:04:28.800 like oh it's doing really well let me
00:04:30.419 put some money into it the average
00:04:31.770 people right and then and then it they
00:04:34.020 dump it because and then they all sell
00:04:35.880 it and then it drops the price right
00:04:38.099 they don't really sell it so let's say
00:04:41.250 as an average person I don't know
00:04:42.960 nothing about stocks and somebody sent
00:04:44.580 me an email this thing's gonna go up to
00:04:46.259 a couple thousand percent well of course
00:04:48.150 I'm interested so at first I'm gonna be
00:04:50.820 a little bit skeptical I'm gonna buy it
00:04:53.010 at one
00:04:54.220 and stuccos to files oh I missed a lot
00:04:56.380 of prophets so I'm gonna add more
00:04:58.030 putting more money into it and when star
00:05:00.280 goes to 20 and that's where the people
00:05:03.670 inside the stock they're holding a large
00:05:06.190 amount of shares and they sell the
00:05:07.990 stocks so when they sell I'm stuck
00:05:10.630 because I can't sell anymore if your
00:05:12.580 stock is already down 50 percent 70
00:05:14.230 percent it's not gonna go back up so
00:05:16.420 it's a scam it's a scam
00:05:17.560 yes is that illegal yes I remember in
00:05:20.350 that movie I thought they were doing
00:05:21.880 like illegal things
00:05:22.870 okay so pump and dumps it is illegal a
00:05:26.380 lot of people get caught basis and yeah
00:05:29.530 it's very sketchy so house opens sorry
00:05:31.930 yeah no no I'm just wondering I'm trying
00:05:33.700 to because I'm that's based off like the
00:05:35.950 movie and it has it like a negative
00:05:37.210 connotation around there right yeah I'm
00:05:39.160 trying to figure out what got to tie you
00:05:41.110 into that okay what do you describe what
00:05:43.360 you do and dumb down as much as you can
00:05:46.150 okay so what I do is I I study their
00:05:50.500 methods of I used to trade Pink Sheets
00:05:53.760 almost 50 times out of mana trades and I
00:05:59.260 will study the market makers so people
00:06:01.420 are inside the stock and I will study
00:06:03.880 their methods well they see and what
00:06:06.250 time would they dump so I will go into
00:06:09.840 the stock they pumped up before and I
00:06:13.120 will see there's gonna be a specific
00:06:14.650 pattern now when they see yeah they were
00:06:16.720 dumped the stock and so I basically want
00:06:21.280 to short the stock
00:06:22.270 I will go against us the stock going up
00:06:24.640 and the more the stock goes down the
00:06:27.550 more money I make so when a decides to
00:06:29.560 dump the stock one day and I'm shorting
00:06:31.960 I will make money instead of losing
00:06:33.640 money by buying stock so when you say
00:06:35.470 they are these people that you like do
00:06:38.800 you know like where they they are or who
00:06:40.960 they are no I have so yours but there's
00:06:43.600 a group of random people who have like a
00:06:47.080 certain pattern in the way they trade
00:06:48.760 sell and buy yeah it was shorting me
00:06:51.940 shorting is basically the opposite of
00:06:55.390 buying so when you buy Oh at one
00:06:56.980 daughter you sell at two daughter you
00:06:58.720 make money but we are shorting you
00:07:00.790 shorting out what two daughter buy it
00:07:02.530 back at one dollar okay so you actually
00:07:05.110 go against you don't go for
00:07:07.580 don't go ever ever no no interest about
00:07:10.490 10% of the time do you think it's safe
00:07:12.409 is that is there a reason for that is it
00:07:14.060 safer okay so a lot of people ask me
00:07:16.069 that question so shorting we are going
00:07:18.530 against a stock let's say when the stock
00:07:20.180 goes goes from two to five we are
00:07:24.199 showing that - you're actually losing
00:07:26.120 over a hundred percent of your
00:07:27.560 investment because you're shorting I -
00:07:29.719 it goes to four or you losing one person
00:07:31.909 goes to file more than that now if
00:07:34.189 you're buying in stock if stock goes to
00:07:35.810 one to zero
00:07:37.009 you only lose about 100 percent and
00:07:38.569 that's it you can't lose more negative I
00:07:42.639 see that's the risk of shorten now
00:07:46.129 Shirley requires a lot of methods risk
00:07:48.919 management how do you manage your risk
00:07:50.919 that's a whole different area for me to
00:07:54.800 cover but if you have a really good risk
00:07:57.349 management shorting does have much more
00:08:00.740 as compared to going mom especially on
00:08:03.139 these small cap stocks right because
00:08:06.740 generally the reason why they're small
00:08:08.900 caps because their fundamentals are
00:08:10.550 really bad so they're basically when so
00:08:14.419 when stock goes in when the company goes
00:08:16.400 public and the reason why they go into
00:08:18.740 public because they need money they need
00:08:20.750 people that you buy the stock days and
00:08:22.430 can do offering to raise money for their
00:08:24.139 projects when you have a really small
00:08:27.289 company you need money to grow your to
00:08:29.659 grow your company that's why yeah well
00:08:32.269 before we get more into like exactly how
00:08:34.610 you do things I kind of want to know
00:08:35.809 like just the origin like so I mean I
00:08:39.948 have a fact here that like and I said it
00:08:41.870 earlier you took $27,000 and turned it
00:08:44.300 into 4 million before the age of 24 yeah
00:08:46.670 how well for one how did you get the
00:08:49.399 27,000 to start okay because a lot of
00:08:51.500 people be like well that's easy to do
00:08:53.329 when you have so much money just a lot
00:08:54.860 for a lot of people right yeah how did
00:08:57.230 you get it to start and then also what
00:09:00.079 got you into this okay so when I was 19
00:09:04.190 I think I was uh I was one year later
00:09:06.440 and compared to other people because I
00:09:07.910 took one year off to narang where were
00:09:10.220 you I was 13 so change students and camp
00:09:16.459 here took a one-year of just learning
00:09:17.660 the language then go to high school
00:09:20.279 in Cincinnati then going to the college
00:09:23.100 Cincinnati
00:09:23.879 yeah how did you learn the language
00:09:25.560 though like we just taking classes or
00:09:27.810 were you watching light no I had I had
00:09:30.509 an American girlfriend and I had
00:09:31.970 American host been me so Wow that's what
00:09:35.279 were they he just kind of picked it up
00:09:36.540 yeah but why Cincinnati like it's old
00:09:38.910 yeah folks I supposed to go to bigger
00:09:41.819 cities and there is a bunch of at that
00:09:43.470 time because there's not a very good
00:09:46.439 relationship between the worlds China
00:09:48.540 and American it's just starting to
00:09:50.579 establish more exchanges going back and
00:09:52.980 forth so that program was just initiated
00:09:55.529 and not very long ago then that time now
00:09:58.230 nobody is very very familiar and that's
00:10:01.290 where a bunch of skinny people comes in
00:10:03.779 and it can take because it because the
00:10:06.600 Chinese parish doesn't really know
00:10:08.009 English you know take advantage trigger
00:10:11.100 Vantage of it that's why that's how I
00:10:12.930 end up being Cincinnati yeah Wow okay so
00:10:16.430 again you so you started with the
00:10:18.410 $27,000 yeah
00:10:19.949 is that just family might like how did
00:10:21.600 you get how did you start off with that
00:10:23.279 amount that's not an easy amount to
00:10:24.899 acquire for the average person yes and
00:10:26.819 at that time I think I was working at a
00:10:29.910 dorm in in the school so I was taking
00:10:33.660 night shifts because all the morning she
00:10:35.040 forgot to take other people so I was
00:10:36.930 basically working around 12 p.m. like a
00:10:43.160 literally just working a regular night
00:10:45.660 one more than a nine-to-five but working
00:10:47.699 a job and saving yeah they pay me a lot
00:10:50.189 more so that's why it took me about a
00:10:53.279 year to save them save that amount and
00:10:57.329 plus some of that like I would say 70%
00:11:01.259 come from the job 30% come from the
00:11:03.600 parents okay and they spotted you a
00:11:06.689 little bit not spy me a little bit it's
00:11:08.699 it's part of the tuition oh is it yeah
00:11:11.550 okay yeah okay so that's so you saved up
00:11:15.930 you had this
00:11:16.790 $27,000 and what just what made you be
00:11:19.680 like hey I think I can do this stock
00:11:22.170 thing like what did you get into it okay
00:11:24.180 so I was in this engineering project and
00:11:27.930 I had the idea of building a generator
00:11:30.990 and that time I were studying
00:11:34.259 nanotechnologies so well the professor
00:11:37.980 comes and say well well we don't have
00:11:39.930 enough to but we don't have enough funds
00:11:42.180 to fund the project and that's where I
00:11:44.759 think about whoa we need some fun so I
00:11:46.620 better just go and make some money and
00:11:52.579 also uh that's how I also got dumped by
00:11:55.290 my girlfriends I was a little bit
00:11:56.699 motivated to to make money to make
00:11:59.429 changes well can i I mean if it's too
00:12:01.679 personally enough to answer but is it
00:12:03.089 money related or is it just like I'm
00:12:05.519 gonna show her it sounds like the
00:12:07.529 Facebook movie like story doesn't it
00:12:09.980 what's the reasoning I mean are you
00:12:12.449 bringing that up so so we get dumped by
00:12:15.300 someone you cannot feel like and not
00:12:16.920 very confident so you only gain
00:12:18.209 confidence back by cheating something
00:12:19.679 and that's why I want to achieve
00:12:22.110 something insignificant and that's
00:12:23.399 that's why I just decided to get me the
00:12:26.759 stock market because at that time as
00:12:28.259 exchange students you can't really work
00:12:30.199 and you can't really invest because you
00:12:34.259 don't have a correct identities so
00:12:36.179 anything can do is to trade the
00:12:37.649 exchanges you can't do that oh wow did
00:12:40.439 you just
00:12:40.949 I mean you understood stocks before no I
00:12:43.559 have no I just looked into it so I just
00:12:45.779 started on youtube and watch people
00:12:47.790 expanding what the stock market is buy
00:12:49.980 some books stock for dummies yeah so I
00:12:54.809 was trading so a node ETF which is it's
00:13:00.179 not a specific company so it's basically
00:13:02.850 it's every day has volatility going up
00:13:05.429 and down so it's basically trading that
00:13:06.959 but every day is only moving about one
00:13:09.000 to two percent so I wasn't making that
00:13:11.519 much money but I see the potential let's
00:13:13.709 say if I invest $500 I can make twenty
00:13:16.679 five and thirty dollars per a day
00:13:18.389 it makes me feel good right because you
00:13:20.279 came up a little bit yeah so that time I
00:13:23.069 wasn't making $15 $13 an hour but you
00:13:26.880 can make $30 in a couple of minutes
00:13:28.889 that's not considered really good so
00:13:31.350 after that I was looking for more
00:13:34.170 aggressive income and I took a look of
00:13:37.230 add to the smoke cap market and I saw
00:13:42.630 there's one stock went from I think was
00:13:44.850 one
00:13:46.639 120-some home ridiculous like that and
00:13:49.610 basically every often they will have one
00:13:53.339 star going from one to sixty one to 50
00:13:55.470 that's a couple thousand percent gang in
00:13:58.470 only two days right so I was trying to
00:14:02.310 think how they can capture that and
00:14:03.750 that's where I started to get into the
00:14:06.630 market I'm trading right now mm-hmm
00:14:08.370 but when you say that I mean I'm sure it
00:14:10.529 always looks very like oh man I just
00:14:12.810 missed on something so big like that's
00:14:14.760 also trap in itself don't you think yeah
00:14:17.040 yes it is
00:14:18.060 that's called fear of missing out it's
00:14:20.820 conformal yeah okay hat I mean it
00:14:23.550 happens there's a reason why it's almost
00:14:24.959 like gambling right there's a reason why
00:14:26.310 people keep putting in money and and
00:14:27.839 going hoping they just get lucky but
00:14:30.720 you're a process isn't based around that
00:14:32.550 my process is not based on that at all
00:14:34.290 it looks like gambling it's not gambling
00:14:36.269 at all and the reason why a lot of
00:14:38.220 people think stock markets gambling
00:14:39.480 because they don't have a specific
00:14:40.410 strategies and you can if you think
00:14:42.630 about a lot of hedge funds like for like
00:14:46.320 Goldman Sachs and bigger hedge funds
00:14:49.709 they're winning a hundred million dollar
00:14:51.389 a day and they're winning 90% at the
00:14:53.940 time so they're opening 228 trading 220
00:14:57.449 I think was 200 trading days or
00:14:59.970 something ridiculous and their gains are
00:15:02.760 significant more than their losses right
00:15:05.510 they have a system yeah a system they
00:15:07.980 have a our algo system or computer
00:15:10.980 trading or some type of high our
00:15:14.100 long-term high winning percentage
00:15:16.170 pattern or high strategy they're using
00:15:18.870 for a while so well there's gotta be
00:15:21.329 something like that
00:15:22.110 and it's very similar to industry right
00:15:26.279 now on pretty much every single industry
00:15:28.230 either is youtubers or really stay
00:15:30.839 people or people do in South America
00:15:33.029 there's only 10% people can be extremely
00:15:34.980 right as full right so pretty much the
00:15:37.800 same laws and a lot of people are
00:15:39.149 thinking of stock market it's now for
00:15:41.519 them but it really depends on how much
00:15:43.410 work you put into but I mean like in the
00:15:46.110 stock market it's a little different in
00:15:48.329 that I feel like if you and all these
00:15:52.199 other companies are winning so often
00:15:53.790 yeah that means there's a ton of people
00:15:55.800 who are constantly losing yes so those
00:15:58.410 people
00:15:58.980 I mean there's the there has its like
00:16:00.540 energy right there's it doesn't money
00:16:02.010 just doesn't appear yeah has to come
00:16:03.510 from somewhere so these people that are
00:16:04.860 losing in a way I mean like if everyone
00:16:09.180 starts winning and if you're giving away
00:16:10.529 I mean your whole thing is you want to
00:16:12.120 help educate people right yeah wouldn't
00:16:13.709 that affect your own business no there
00:16:15.389 are so many people right I mean I don't
00:16:17.519 but in theory right in theory if all
00:16:20.160 these companies if everyone starts
00:16:21.480 catching on basically what you're saying
00:16:23.279 is there's always gonna be dummies oh
00:16:24.720 there's always a be done yeah and that
00:16:27.870 the you what like what is your goal
00:16:30.170 essentially right now okay so my goal
00:16:33.120 from the very beginning is I started
00:16:35.370 when I was a newbie I was a newbie and I
00:16:37.889 didn't get that many help from people it
00:16:40.529 took me about one year looking at the
00:16:43.230 market consistently eight hours every
00:16:45.180 single day without non-stop even the
00:16:47.399 holidays
00:16:47.940 well holidays I was studying for
00:16:49.410 statistics but and it took me a while to
00:16:52.500 really figure out what's working what's
00:16:54.209 not working so if I can give this to
00:16:56.940 people and that can help all younger
00:16:59.639 people that when I want to have their
00:17:01.889 dreams it will take much less time for
00:17:04.890 them to achieve their goals okay so I
00:17:07.709 have a question though the way that you
00:17:09.209 came about it it's just like your
00:17:11.429 ability to recognize patterns that you
00:17:13.919 feel like give you a lot of success or
00:17:16.020 is it something that almost any person
00:17:18.030 can see it's pretty much everybody can
00:17:21.299 see if you're a nerd what to do so the
00:17:25.890 the way I come out all those patterns is
00:17:28.470 I will track about a thousand samples
00:17:30.570 and up one specific pattern and I will
00:17:34.860 calculate how many times doing how many
00:17:37.380 times do I lose now will show me what
00:17:39.480 say if you trade this pattern for three
00:17:41.549 years ninety five percent can wink I
00:17:43.710 presume can news and well I would take
00:17:46.950 that trade all day and you favor peers
00:17:49.020 your peers and also attract a frequency
00:17:52.049 a frequency of the patterns so how many
00:17:53.460 times they haven't per year so I can use
00:17:55.140 that frequency times how much reward I
00:17:58.740 can make on each trade I can simulate
00:18:01.230 again of how much money can make for a
00:18:04.470 year mmm and this pattern that you saw
00:18:07.590 and you're studying is it something that
00:18:09.270 was already
00:18:10.600 I just figured out and previously talked
00:18:13.210 about is it something that you kind of
00:18:14.679 pioneered some of the strategy a career
00:18:17.289 day that by myself some of you are
00:18:18.789 already there from the books and stuff
00:18:21.639 you read yeah okay there's there's so
00:18:23.710 many different patterns and techniques
00:18:25.980 you know there's a lot of different
00:18:28.240 companies that have you know different
00:18:31.570 strategies and they sell their their
00:18:33.429 sale they sell their strategies yes kind
00:18:35.259 of like what you got you guys are doing
00:18:36.639 as well what's what's a differentiator
00:18:39.610 between your strategy and all the other
00:18:41.889 thousand strategies that are out there
00:18:43.539 okay so when you are search on internet
00:18:45.100 says how to trade that will penny stocks
00:18:47.559 how to trade micro cap stocks wait when
00:18:49.840 you when you searching there's gonna be
00:18:51.940 a thousand people come up and you don't
00:18:54.250 know where to start and so I think the
00:18:56.350 very fundamental thing you need to look
00:18:58.179 at is people's track record
00:19:00.549 do you have account statements laying
00:19:02.679 out does this person show you see is he
00:19:05.230 consistent profitable for the last five
00:19:07.389 years and if he is not then it's not
00:19:10.210 somebody wanna learn from and other
00:19:12.070 people just showing their cars no people
00:19:15.519 on YouTube showing their cars houses to
00:19:19.179 lure people in to buy their program but
00:19:21.879 they don't really have any official
00:19:23.529 track record mm-hmm that's called
00:19:26.500 lifestyle marketing and I hate that
00:19:27.850 button right but you have some stuff
00:19:30.279 that you kind of brought with us right
00:19:32.230 that like explain to me what we're
00:19:35.230 looking at because that this looks crazy
00:19:36.789 it looks like you're making a beat or
00:19:38.649 something okay okay so the green number
00:19:41.860 right here they realize so this is how
00:19:44.259 much I made today sorry real quick if
00:19:46.240 you could just because we have some
00:19:47.440 audio listeners so maybe this is a
00:19:49.179 program people can oh yeah okay so you
00:19:52.600 want me to talk about the program like
00:19:53.980 what's it about what you're talking
00:19:55.870 about okay so this is my brokerage
00:19:57.970 account this is a trade 0 it's the
00:20:00.909 brokerage out there that specialize in
00:20:03.250 small cap stocks and this is the
00:20:05.740 platform which I look the stock for and
00:20:09.149 well generally you don't really need a
00:20:11.169 path on your own all you need just the
00:20:12.610 platform to trade then it's just a
00:20:15.759 program people can download there's a
00:20:17.710 program for free uh no dad how 3 how
00:20:21.549 much the program's cost $7,000 so
00:20:24.280 this one cost about $200 per month
00:20:28.120 this one cost about $90 per month no
00:20:31.510 there's a trade zero this trizzie oh
00:20:33.760 yeah okay you don't really need this one
00:20:36.310 all you need just this one you just need
00:20:37.690 the trades are you okay ninety thousand
00:20:39.160 per month yeah so right here you can see
00:20:41.890 by sale Shore and cover so by the battle
00:20:45.280 style sale you sell style he's sure to
00:20:46.780 controller stock when once you finish
00:20:48.820 shorting you want to cover all your
00:20:49.870 positions so we're going to take a
00:20:51.490 position in shorting your position goes
00:20:55.090 in negative
00:20:55.990 we're buying your position goes positive
00:20:58.390 so it's literally the opposite and right
00:21:02.740 here that's my account number so you can
00:21:04.990 see it's XD use of ducks and and they
00:21:10.240 realize 33,000 today that's what you
00:21:13.240 made today that's what I made in profit
00:21:15.430 not in tours that in total that's in
00:21:18.810 profit so you made 33 grand today yeah
00:21:21.880 is that normal
00:21:23.310 pretty normal yeah on average you make
00:21:26.140 about 30 grand a day not averaging 30
00:21:28.330 grand a day but it really comes and goes
00:21:31.390 you know can't really tell
00:21:32.500 I think 30 grand every every three days
00:21:38.350 hmm so some some biggest lost days
00:21:41.380 biggest last days for me will be seventy
00:21:44.620 thousand well I think it's mean that I
00:21:47.170 only take that loss is pretty much about
00:21:49.720 two three times a year and the biggest
00:21:53.380 gain that made is two hundred thousand
00:21:55.900 three hundred dollars today and so I
00:22:00.040 guess with a this is an automated
00:22:03.130 program or do you have to put in
00:22:05.890 specific numbers in what you want to do
00:22:07.870 according to the patterns yes this is
00:22:10.390 what do you want to do specifically
00:22:12.130 let's say we want to short stock at this
00:22:14.200 time then you click short mm-hmm and
00:22:16.240 it's not 40 holloman air can't recognize
00:22:18.550 patterns and god yeah and why do you use
00:22:21.460 this program versus cuz I have some
00:22:23.470 stocks as well I mean I'm not a date
00:22:25.240 trader but I use like a trade
00:22:27.790 what's it what's the biggest difference
00:22:29.740 between a trade and a software that's
00:22:31.810 more looks a little more complicated
00:22:34.120 okay so I'm gonna give a very
00:22:36.400 the painting about Brokerage out there
00:22:37.930 yeah and you guys hear about probably
00:22:39.970 Interactive Brokers e-trade Robinhood
00:22:41.980 probably most popular and Robin Hood I
00:22:45.220 don't like that the way you see
00:22:47.710 everything is free but when you're
00:22:49.540 buying a stock especially for beginners
00:22:51.820 they're taking your entries so basically
00:22:54.730 they say you bought at one and they will
00:22:56.830 execute you add 1.05 what I mean
00:23:00.130 executing at 1.05 so when you want to
00:23:03.040 buy at one daughter but you actually
00:23:05.080 bought at 1.05 mm-hmm so all that zero
00:23:08.140 point buy for them belongs to Robin Hood
00:23:10.420 but I thought Robin Hood is free yes
00:23:12.430 free
00:23:12.730 yeah it's company to three trades right
00:23:14.530 when you buy it they were taking money
00:23:16.870 from tax yes I could tax
00:23:19.600 yeah so they actually charge you behind
00:23:21.700 the scenes on your profits yes if you
00:23:24.880 get yeah now when you get profit no it
00:23:27.400 doesn't really matter we can get profit
00:23:28.540 when you lose it will still take partial
00:23:30.010 when you sale hmm yeah also we again
00:23:33.310 take fire showing use mmm in or so they
00:23:36.520 win all the time that's why I don't
00:23:39.370 really like Robin Hood but it's I mean
00:23:42.390 yes the reason don't really like a Robin
00:23:44.710 Hood now follow three trade Interactive
00:23:46.540 Brokers the one I like the best they do
00:23:49.360 charge a very small amount when you are
00:23:52.180 buying certain amount of shares but if
00:23:55.090 you have a really small town they say
00:23:56.710 you only have a couple thousand dollars
00:23:58.120 or five hundred dollars I think to
00:24:00.250 produce the best for you follow on that
00:24:02.770 and brokerage take dollars per trade you
00:24:06.040 said they would take about ten dollars
00:24:07.690 on our trade and when you place the
00:24:09.940 order in the total amount it should take
00:24:12.250 ten dollars no matter how many shares
00:24:14.200 your trading mmm some of the broker you
00:24:16.060 take 0.0004 and per share so so the
00:24:22.240 reason right now that you're kind of
00:24:23.770 doing like this podcast and you've made
00:24:26.170 other appearances in other youtubers
00:24:27.610 videos and stuff like that is because
00:24:28.870 you're trying to get yourself out there
00:24:31.090 so that you can kind of I guess promote
00:24:34.300 the fact that you're kind of being you
00:24:35.560 want to be a teacher
00:24:36.400 those aren't degree like you gotyou
00:24:37.510 offer courses yeah to teach people like
00:24:39.910 us we know nothing from the very
00:24:42.280 beginning how you can get started in
00:24:44.080 doing something like this correct yeah
00:24:45.550 and you really believe that you're not
00:24:50.080 special
00:24:50.710 that in terms of like you need you
00:24:52.810 averaged um person like me or Paco you
00:24:56.500 could learn something like this if we
00:24:57.760 took your courses yes okay yeah I know
00:25:00.850 and just because I quit I quit you know
00:25:06.340 you know I didn't bring in David I'm its
00:25:08.860 mark yeah but so people like I mean
00:25:13.210 obviously this sounds like just seeing
00:25:14.860 that number oh you made 33 grand of
00:25:16.450 course I'm interested of course
00:25:17.710 everybody who hears is interested but
00:25:19.120 naturally the skeptic in me the skeptic
00:25:21.100 and everyone is like yes so this sounds
00:25:22.990 too good to be true this guy seems Shady
00:25:24.700 not that I think you're Shady
00:25:28.510 but you know why should people take you
00:25:31.090 as legitimate like why explain does what
00:25:33.520 makes you different from your average
00:25:34.330 shark or the things they see on the big
00:25:37.120 short or the things they see on Wall
00:25:38.920 Street you know okay so the thing is a
00:25:41.710 lot of people out there as I said the
00:25:44.530 very fundamental thing is they don't
00:25:45.820 have their track record and I have about
00:25:48.490 I think I have my verification on
00:25:50.920 2018-2019 and because a lot of people
00:25:54.190 did have a very very skepticism so like
00:25:57.580 they they doubted me that I actually
00:26:00.040 turned twenty seven thousand into nine
00:26:02.500 hundred thousand within a year and so I
00:26:05.730 replicate that performances in 2018 by
00:26:09.060 auditing my calcium and say every single
00:26:11.560 month to a CPA firm and I did it so if
00:26:16.330 you guys are a lot of people are skip
00:26:18.670 ilysm they can look at my account
00:26:20.290 statements and you put that out there
00:26:22.420 public yeah yeah and that cost you money
00:26:25.120 to do as well it cost
00:26:26.620 yeah they cost a lot cause like 50k
00:26:28.600 sometimes even every time you do an
00:26:30.910 audit every year yeah oh wow
00:26:32.950 it's expensive to audit that's just
00:26:35.890 that's six days of works okay and also I
00:26:41.290 also review the one of my count
00:26:43.150 statements that for the maximum
00:26:45.160 performances I turned forty one thousand
00:26:47.860 into three hundred thousand you know
00:26:50.260 Martha so now I guess um also with your
00:26:54.970 cuz how do people learn your stuff is it
00:26:57.460 a online courses or book it's an online
00:26:59.980 course online course and about how long
00:27:01.690 does it take or is it like you
00:27:03.100 at your own pace so typically will take
00:27:05.799 about a year year and half to pretty
00:27:08.409 much no other strategies and getting
00:27:10.179 settled in your head so it's almost like
00:27:11.889 a trade school in a way yeah when you
00:27:13.960 say a year and a half is it doing this
00:27:16.480 everyday for a year and a half doing
00:27:18.159 this pretty much study about at least
00:27:20.799 two to four hours a day okay you've got
00:27:22.840 something that we're like what you did
00:27:24.159 is work pretty much holiday to save up
00:27:25.960 and then study for like a couple few
00:27:28.179 hours so going to school and then also
00:27:29.830 yeah it's pretty much the same pretty
00:27:32.259 much very everything that you going to
00:27:33.610 school or going getting good at sports
00:27:35.350 they take you right how long have you
00:27:37.029 been giving out these courses I've been
00:27:39.970 giving out for a year almost two years
00:27:42.759 now and have you had people yes succeed
00:27:45.519 and have you had people fail good angry
00:27:48.129 customers yes we did so we have at least
00:27:52.350 20 students not it's already over at
00:27:56.350 least 200,000 and we have about two
00:28:00.070 students that is over two million
00:28:01.330 already in a year or a year yeah and we
00:28:06.850 did have customers that they won't speak
00:28:09.279 Spanish so like they can't understand
00:28:10.929 the course that's yeah but is there
00:28:14.830 anyone who took it and they just didn't
00:28:17.590 see results and maybe it's because they
00:28:19.360 weren't studying or maybe they weren't
00:28:20.529 doing it right but like there has to be
00:28:22.690 people who like it there's no way you
00:28:24.279 have a hundred percent track record it
00:28:25.929 not 100 percent tracker as I said a lot
00:28:27.879 of people they don't really put the work
00:28:29.139 in right failed and they have very angry
00:28:32.559 a lot of the 20 people how many roughly
00:28:34.629 do you think so 20 percent I would say
00:28:38.110 20 year of 120 out of 100 yeah kind of
00:28:42.399 like didn't so it's a pretty good
00:28:44.409 percentage 20 out of 100 are doing well
00:28:48.070 or not doing well 20 out of hundred are
00:28:50.799 doing very well
00:28:51.639 mmm do you well then probably 50 out of
00:28:54.549 hundred okay yeah yeah that makes sense
00:28:56.919 because I mean so so this track record
00:28:59.830 right I mean some would say that oh why
00:29:03.610 isn't it 90 percent right but what
00:29:05.289 you're saying is that even though
00:29:07.269 somebody can purchase your class it
00:29:10.450 doesn't mean that they're studying it
00:29:11.980 the right way is that is that how it is
00:29:14.320 or is it that they're not starting off
00:29:15.820 with enough money
00:29:16.710 or is it I mean I'm sure it's a variety
00:29:19.830 of reasons yeah there's a lot of people
00:29:22.559 that they just had kids and the bottle
00:29:24.450 cords and having get into a burner
00:29:26.850 because I do live trading webinars to
00:29:28.200 people I've trade in front of them
00:29:29.850 and they don't even come to the webinars
00:29:32.159 yeah and that's how they failed quick
00:29:36.299 they wanted they bought it because they
00:29:37.919 wanted to make money quickly as opposed
00:29:40.080 to just wanting to study actually really
00:29:42.210 apply it yeah well a lot of people that
00:29:44.519 just come in well Stephen Hubbell just
00:29:46.440 give me your alerts and the William bio
00:29:48.269 just buy the same thing with you you
00:29:50.249 can't do that because what happens and
00:29:52.860 when I just go off I just want to trip
00:29:55.110 I'm at home I don't want to teach
00:29:56.009 anymore you're not self-sufficient and
00:29:57.990 it's not gonna help you it's the whole
00:30:00.299 like teacher man or give a man a fish he
00:30:02.940 eats for a day yeah
00:30:04.169 teach a man to fish he eats for his life
00:30:05.820 yeah and also I feel like they're lazy
00:30:07.590 the the fundamental of the program is I
00:30:11.129 won't teach them to be self-sufficient
00:30:12.539 not being and to put in the work because
00:30:15.570 you did yeah you have to earn it you
00:30:16.919 can't just copy notes yeah yeah so
00:30:19.169 essentially and then going back to kind
00:30:21.480 of I guess skeptics you I mean you
00:30:25.289 clearly make a ton of money daily yeah
00:30:28.200 why charge for these courses if the
00:30:31.019 whole goal is to get these people to do
00:30:32.399 obviously I get it it's a business in
00:30:34.259 itself yeah is the goal to because this
00:30:36.720 business you think could be way bigger
00:30:38.639 and it also helps people or is it like
00:30:41.369 you know I mean it's kind of it's kind
00:30:43.889 of strange to the average person like
00:30:45.210 you're making this much money why you
00:30:46.259 need to charge why not just upload
00:30:47.399 YouTube videos yeah add you upload a lot
00:30:49.350 of YouTube videos for teaching people
00:30:51.240 and everything is free out there and
00:30:53.340 also the reason why I charge people is
00:30:56.610 that they want to feel something is
00:30:57.899 important when you buy something that's
00:30:59.490 super expensive you think is important
00:31:01.529 so that's why we just give stuff for
00:31:04.860 free they don't really care yeah yeah
00:31:06.600 yeah and they don't take it necessarily
00:31:08.249 as seriously yeah true okay well we're
00:31:11.460 at our half time right now so we're
00:31:13.259 gonna take our quick shishi break and
00:31:14.970 we'll be right back all right or do you
00:31:16.919 have a special talent oh yeah we do that
00:31:19.320 now can you tell us a funny joke or can
00:31:21.690 you sing is there something do that
00:31:23.220 halftime show performance anything you
00:31:25.169 want to do I'm really good at gaming but
00:31:26.960 yeah I guess we'll just cut to an hour
00:31:29.220 games
00:31:30.180 a live stream will come back we have
00:31:32.580 some personal questions for you as well
00:31:34.140 so I think it'll be a little interesting
00:31:36.030 yeah we'll be right back and we're back
00:31:49.020 so what do you have here okay so this is
00:31:52.260 my brokerage account statements you can
00:31:54.240 see starting day it's December 20 on
00:31:57.690 December 1st 2018 ending period is
00:32:00.570 December 31st also this is what you were
00:32:02.520 talking about earlier about having proof
00:32:04.230 of your track record that most people
00:32:06.780 who give advice to basically do this
00:32:09.060 don't have yeah okay so this is a
00:32:11.970 website and you can call it your
00:32:13.860 verified if it's real or not and this
00:32:15.720 listeners it's trade 0.30 Kol
00:32:20.460 yeah so this is a mag well I don't want
00:32:23.310 to show my account number but this is my
00:32:25.620 account number and now the only thing
00:32:28.380 you need to pay attention to is you can
00:32:30.000 see right here
00:32:30.510 net profit right net P and else and
00:32:33.210 that's net profit and you can see on
00:32:37.140 this day made one hundred twenty one
00:32:38.580 hundred seventeen thousand this day lost
00:32:40.620 six thousand this day lost thirty five
00:32:43.200 thousand the study made twenty nine
00:32:44.970 thousand and overall forum for a month
00:32:47.670 and made about two hundred fifty five
00:32:49.110 thousand that's one month it's one month
00:32:50.910 yeah Wow
00:32:52.290 so the days you lose like 30-something
00:32:53.940 thousand you don't even that's not even
00:32:55.590 a drop in the bucket
00:32:57.060 yeah and it's its base as part of it
00:32:59.970 it's part of it so it's not like it's
00:33:01.470 like you made a good bet and get a bad
00:33:03.150 name if you ask any legitimate traders
00:33:05.700 you can't really win every single trade
00:33:07.800 right now possible so so that's why you
00:33:10.500 had to start off with twenty seven
00:33:12.090 thousand because without enough capital
00:33:13.830 well I mean I guess you could bet really
00:33:15.900 low right you can't ya because so I mean
00:33:19.590 in general what what let's say someone
00:33:21.900 only has a thousand dollars okay it's a
00:33:26.480 five hundred cuz he said number but you
00:33:30.090 are making and losing between what like
00:33:33.090 five and twenty dollars a day yes pretty
00:33:35.670 much like that and then you'd and that
00:33:37.110 was enough to get you like how did you
00:33:38.520 at what point did you take that was it
00:33:41.550 gradual gradual growth because that
00:33:43.350 seems like
00:33:43.980 big leap in such a short amount of
00:33:45.960 time okay so when I was treating with
00:33:48.299 the $500 I was losing there and there
00:33:50.130 and once I got into the small cap market
00:33:52.440 and that was tracking statistics so
00:33:54.630 because I was an engineer everything is
00:33:56.220 based on statistics so that's why I use
00:33:59.250 the engineering method into the stock
00:34:00.720 market and they want to track this one
00:34:02.400 specific patterns
00:34:04.350 well how much well when I trade how much
00:34:06.570 money can I make
00:34:07.380 what's the percentage of reward so after
00:34:09.690 I check that was 20% and that attract
00:34:11.820 the winning percentage was 85% so each
00:34:15.149 trade I have a eighty eighty-five
00:34:16.800 percent win chance and the twenty
00:34:18.629 percent of the world that can make
00:34:20.310 thousands of the same trade again again
00:34:22.918 and again then that's how I Verdi's put
00:34:26.310 more money so when you were just getting
00:34:27.840 started I mean assuming these people
00:34:29.399 that are taking your courses and they're
00:34:30.540 trying it for themselves
00:34:31.560 yeah they're not gonna be as good as you
00:34:33.899 in the beginning yes right so you have
00:34:35.790 to I mean I'm sure you've had a lot of
00:34:38.310 losses more so than now in the beginning
00:34:40.830 yes how were you able to convince
00:34:42.899 yourself like this is I'm doing the
00:34:44.730 right thing you know
00:34:45.750 okay when those losses were happening so
00:34:47.639 when the losses are happening a lot of
00:34:48.840 people so well as a human nature and
00:34:51.510 when people take a loss the instant
00:34:54.418 reaction they will feel is I won't make
00:34:56.100 this money back so yeah so I want to
00:35:00.119 make the money back they will make
00:35:01.200 emotional mistakes that's how casino
00:35:05.730 people lose money exactly yeah and now
00:35:08.700 the reason why you trade in stock market
00:35:10.980 because there's a wall there's a edge
00:35:13.350 for high only percentages 70 percent 80
00:35:16.470 percent even the sixty percent can still
00:35:18.630 make money in your honor wrong wrong and
00:35:20.600 when you are taking a loss in the single
00:35:23.790 into my mindset is so I track this
00:35:27.150 pattern and I do have 15 percent of
00:35:30.060 losing percentages and when I lose
00:35:33.320 also your mind I will know how much
00:35:36.570 money I can make per year because I know
00:35:38.040 the frequency of the pattern or
00:35:40.200 risk/reward of the pattern how many
00:35:42.450 times it happened per year and and I can
00:35:44.970 use that to simulate again it can make
00:35:46.650 about five million dollars a year and in
00:35:50.010 my mind I know I can make five million
00:35:51.330 dollars a year if I take a one loss it
00:35:52.890 doesn't really matter
00:35:53.940 is walk away and come back again so it's
00:35:56.730 more like a long-term it's more like a
00:35:58.680 long-term investment instead of like
00:35:59.970 looking at right right right
00:36:01.680 Wow how many different so like for
00:36:05.369 example yesterday how many different
00:36:07.470 companies are you trading are you
00:36:09.599 focusing on like one company or are you
00:36:11.789 inputting like a bunch of money into it
00:36:13.349 or are you kind of spreading out amongst
00:36:15.630 like a thousand companies and putting
00:36:17.549 like a tiny bit in each one okay so this
00:36:19.770 is where you want to pick one stuff so
00:36:21.420 you want to trade and now typically when
00:36:22.740 I look at the market I want to look for
00:36:24.569 everything that has volume that means
00:36:26.280 people are other people are looking at
00:36:28.049 it as well so typically market opens at
00:36:31.109 9:30 I wake up around 9:00 and just
00:36:33.690 generally take a look at the overall
00:36:35.010 market and what stock is hot so one
00:36:37.619 stock is up about or 50% already so a
00:36:40.200 lot of people will have eyes on it and
00:36:41.640 that's very generous volume that's the
00:36:44.400 stock that will pick the volume is the
00:36:45.750 amount of activity going on between
00:36:48.140 buyers and sellers yes mm-hmm
00:36:51.079 see so the higher the volume it means
00:36:54.180 that most people like a lot of people
00:36:56.099 are tricked there's a lot of activity
00:36:57.480 which means there's more potential for
00:36:59.369 ups and downs
00:37:00.960 well it's and downs and that means
00:37:02.450 volatilities yeah so up and downs and
00:37:05.630 when you there's more people trading
00:37:07.650 there's more newbies Kim right because I
00:37:12.119 mean in general like and in a way you
00:37:14.430 can't really feel bad because those are
00:37:16.799 the people who weren't willing to put in
00:37:18.089 the time to study yeah and and really
00:37:20.190 there's those are the casual gamblers
00:37:22.200 like going to Vegas with money yeah
00:37:24.089 they're not gonna play the odds they're
00:37:25.619 playing emotion yes yeah I guess I
00:37:27.900 understand that it's easier to because
00:37:29.520 you don't have to see their faces yeah
00:37:31.230 it's not like at the poker table yeah
00:37:34.279 you know he has the money I was waiting
00:37:37.109 you know
00:37:37.650 okay I understand that so you don't
00:37:40.170 trade like stable stable stocks yeah I
00:37:45.599 don't really trade staple stock I want
00:37:47.039 to trade something that can move 70
00:37:48.539 percent 100 percent thousand percent on
00:37:50.369 the day so the stable ones are the ones
00:37:52.289 that are more for long-term would you
00:37:54.359 say the stable ones are yes for non term
00:37:56.609 for swing trades or something index
00:37:59.609 family what's a swing trade it's being
00:38:01.230 traded is you are holding four positions
00:38:03.690 for a couple month a year so even a
00:38:06.359 couple months you consider a long
00:38:07.770 from trade yeah instead consider no
00:38:09.600 because you do it what by the day I did
00:38:11.430 a yeah yeah so take us to your everyday
00:38:14.880 like you told us something early I don't
00:38:16.830 know if it was on the podcast or right
00:38:17.910 before but you work like two hours a day
00:38:19.620 yeah obviously in the beginning it was
00:38:23.790 all day yeah and for now at your level
00:38:26.280 and your success rate you wake up at
00:38:28.770 9:00 you can start at 9:30 you're done
00:38:31.410 by 11:30 yeah most actually and most of
00:38:34.650 the time just by 10:00 I want to stay
00:38:37.260 about 30 to 45 minutes and then what do
00:38:40.230 you do go to LA you know get a haircut
00:38:51.260 so get into your personal stuff
00:38:53.720 apparently we just heard before we
00:38:55.710 started this that you're you made it to
00:38:58.260 a competition in StarCraft you're huge
00:39:00.510 gamer Starcraft 2 David and I both used
00:39:03.600 to play that not nearly as good you made
00:39:06.120 it to the top 64 in the world yeah at
00:39:08.820 one point I was in the WCS champion the
00:39:14.700 championship he was at WCS so we're
00:39:16.830 serious war series championship oh you
00:39:19.710 were in it how far did you make it I
00:39:21.390 think it was made in road of 64 and I
00:39:26.610 lost in the road of 64 oh my gosh that's
00:39:30.240 still crazy I guess you know what when
00:39:32.250 you have that kind of money and then
00:39:33.660 you're just like I'm gonna get good at
00:39:35.040 Starcraft so you buddy star crap every
00:39:36.480 day yeah is this before or after you
00:39:40.080 started this is before actually when I
00:39:42.120 trying to develop the stock market
00:39:43.890 strategies I used the sorceress
00:39:45.450 strategies because it's more almost like
00:39:47.910 same message same psychology counter
00:39:50.460 strategies you want to counter people
00:39:52.080 with that doing mistakes
00:39:54.960 yeah making me say if you were going the
00:39:56.670 meta which is like buying stock yes then
00:39:58.950 you're going counter meta yeah so people
00:40:00.990 are buying battlecruisers you're getting
00:40:08.940 anti-air yeah your minds okay so okay so
00:40:12.960 it's to you it was almost like common
00:40:14.370 sense yeah okay interesting and you see
00:40:17.460 something you can basically we never see
00:40:20.010 a certain action
00:40:20.930 you will know why they're building you
00:40:23.119 can do you need to against it it's just
00:40:25.160 very much a psychologist right right
00:40:28.400 right
00:40:28.640 you're interesting gaming doesn't just
00:40:31.550 create gun violence
00:40:33.260 it creates money so I have a question
00:40:37.520 here so I you know a lot of people say
00:40:40.040 they look up to you know the advice of
00:40:42.050 Warren Buffett right yeah as a very
00:40:45.500 successful trader mom you know something
00:40:47.599 that I did read somewhere that Warren
00:40:49.490 Buffett said is that if you you know
00:40:52.220 take your paycheck and you take a
00:40:55.369 percentage of it and you invest it into
00:40:57.319 a fund or the sp500 it has a history of
00:41:00.500 you know it's an uphill slope yes with
00:41:03.020 some dips in between but from the very
00:41:05.630 beginning of the stock market it's
00:41:06.890 always been an upward trend yes so he
00:41:09.680 was saying that you know if you put your
00:41:10.940 money in there eventually you will make
00:41:12.890 money and it'll compound and it'll make
00:41:15.500 even more yeah and and so that's like a
00:41:18.829 long-term kind of mindset right yeah do
00:41:21.500 you do you believe in I do believe it
00:41:23.240 yes when you invest into us being from
00:41:25.480 500 or going to in this index pounds you
00:41:29.569 do make money on long-term thank you
00:41:31.130 five years ten years but you don't
00:41:32.599 really make aggressive income and what
00:41:35.599 percentage do does that generate you
00:41:37.549 would you say oh I don't really know 20
00:41:39.349 percent 50 percent maybe it'll be more
00:41:41.540 than that she's pretty good over a long
00:41:44.089 period of time period of time but when
00:41:46.280 you look at anything I trade twenty
00:41:49.040 seven thousand into 1 million by already
00:41:52.040 account statements that's that's that
00:41:55.970 presumably over 20 percent
00:41:59.470 it's thousands of percent yeah right so
00:42:02.720 I mean ever since so it's been about
00:42:04.730 five years five six years of success
00:42:07.970 yeah right how has it changed your
00:42:12.140 confidence I mean like you said you kind
00:42:13.579 of started this because of your ex like
00:42:16.430 I mean there's no I'm sure a part of you
00:42:18.290 is kind of like you know yeah how do you
00:42:22.970 take us back to where you are now like
00:42:25.010 to that scenario that first collect you
00:42:26.329 start like how do you feel are you like
00:42:27.380 over that are you like do you keep in
00:42:29.480 touch with her like what's this one say
00:42:31.609 I'm pretty much over it
00:42:33.150 okay well that's good but as she hit you
00:42:35.279 up hey Steven hi rise up you have higher
00:42:40.289 standards meeting you up though that's
00:42:45.180 true I mean I'm sure you've seen it
00:42:47.130 people know you have money and you're
00:42:48.569 making money and naturally just in
00:42:51.599 anything anything you become famous you
00:42:54.029 make money you're naturally gonna get
00:42:55.619 people coming after you there's gonna be
00:42:57.420 people who want something from you
00:42:58.710 including girls yeah and she hasn't hit
00:43:01.470 you up since she did once but oh yeah
00:43:05.220 but that doesn't mean it was just for
00:43:06.900 money could be but I mean how has it
00:43:09.869 changed your life I mean obviously I
00:43:12.510 don't know I actually don't know how was
00:43:14.400 your everyday life now that you work
00:43:15.869 those two hours that's not trying to get
00:43:17.220 at what else other than gaming how does
00:43:19.529 it change your life really change
00:43:21.029 anything my life I love cars and they're
00:43:23.670 just bought cars and nicer car once you
00:43:26.160 try six-month and get tired of a generic
00:43:28.260 honor I don't think your personality
00:43:31.319 changes and they're losing you fly to LA
00:43:34.980 30 times a year yes private jet
00:43:40.039 sometimes no nope every day okay because
00:43:44.099 Cincinnati doesn't have a private jet
00:43:47.210 yeah okay well I mean like a like I said
00:43:51.150 that might change cuz you're only at the
00:43:53.220 four million more or five million mark
00:43:54.809 right who says in five years you won't
00:43:56.819 be what six exponent no what are you
00:44:00.569 projecting in five years I don't know
00:44:02.339 because there's a synonym you can make
00:44:03.660 on micro cap stocks
00:44:05.130 you can't exceed 20 millions a year yeah
00:44:07.650 so thinking about you think that at the
00:44:09.569 rate that you've been you know I don't
00:44:11.670 know maybe it's consistent you hit a
00:44:13.230 plateau where you get a million a year
00:44:15.180 or has it been like twenty dollars then
00:44:17.760 making a hundred dollars and then a
00:44:19.020 thousand then then thirty thousand like
00:44:21.089 yeah what's your projection the
00:44:23.549 projection is I don't really you don't
00:44:25.559 really want to do this forever
00:44:26.880 you always want to like spray your
00:44:29.309 folios really stay which I just a couple
00:44:33.089 properties don't want to go and once you
00:44:35.730 have all the proposals they all generate
00:44:37.529 any money and so on and and these
00:44:39.150 courses - it's a business in itself get
00:44:42.660 enough people then you don't even need
00:44:43.890 to do this and the reason why I start
00:44:45.750 courses is
00:44:46.890 you guys all know packing like a year
00:44:49.500 ago through a year ago lot of people are
00:44:51.570 starting lifestyle marketing I don't
00:44:53.580 know if you guys notice courses yeah are
00:44:55.740 showing you houses but there's like that
00:44:58.620 one guy on YouTube Tai Lopez yeah yeah
00:45:01.350 yeah it's all my stuff marking where is
00:45:04.050 the track record and why do dad show us
00:45:06.690 the track record well I mean I think a
00:45:08.760 lot of those I never I was just annoyed
00:45:10.890 by those ads I just be like this guy is
00:45:13.650 such a douchebag anyway I would look at
00:45:16.260 that I don't feel like it would get
00:45:17.100 people's attention you're right but then
00:45:18.720 but then are they legitimate they might
00:45:21.840 be don't know yeah you don't know but
00:45:23.580 but you're going the route of like
00:45:25.200 here's transparency yeah and I'm sure
00:45:30.090 there's gonna be people who the people
00:45:31.980 who are mad at you who are gonna speak
00:45:33.180 out against you yeah but if you have the
00:45:35.160 proof you have the receipts then I mean
00:45:37.530 there's nothing you can really say and I
00:45:39.240 think that's important to be transparent
00:45:40.800 I think it's very important yeah okay I
00:45:43.140 think it's one of the most important
00:45:44.820 yeah before you start teaching people
00:45:46.470 because if you don't know what you're
00:45:48.090 teaching then you're teaching that run
00:45:49.410 the wrong thing and a lot of people
00:45:53.870 that's not right yeah right okay I mean
00:45:58.380 do you so you do you enjoy the teaching
00:46:00.270 process would you say you're a better
00:46:01.440 teacher or a better try see my cuz when
00:46:05.160 I teach people because I attract a lot
00:46:07.320 of more younger generations so a lot of
00:46:09.570 people are gamers and funny people and
00:46:12.860 we have our own common languages so it's
00:46:15.780 actually yeah it's a do you enjoy
00:46:17.730 teaching yeah and then you feel
00:46:19.470 obviously so how exactly just to give
00:46:22.620 you a rough estimate how much are these
00:46:24.300 courses some of the courses or if
00:46:28.350 they're super beginners to start yeah to
00:46:30.330 start like $90 come on okay so it's a
00:46:33.780 good subscription service yeah like
00:46:35.280 anything else like almost like going to
00:46:36.540 I mean I guess a really cheap college
00:46:38.550 yeah not considering not calling what
00:46:40.950 you do a college but that's kind of what
00:46:42.660 it is is you're taking a school right it
00:46:44.700 depends on how what I well how deep you
00:46:47.940 want to go of course is I mean but do
00:46:50.520 you think I mean how many courses are
00:46:53.160 there like do you think you have to
00:46:54.360 finish it to get to where you're at
00:46:56.310 yeah I would say
00:47:00.040 there's about well it's not how many
00:47:03.130 courses is about how many live webinars
00:47:05.170 and I do and you watch me trade I can
00:47:08.020 pretty much do the same thing I'm not
00:47:10.030 there looking up in the morning and make
00:47:15.070 sure execution goes good and doing your
00:47:17.620 own statistics it's the method I see
00:47:21.580 it's like learning how to do it yeah and
00:47:24.220 you have a lot of videos online you said
00:47:27.190 right yeah so what differentiates that
00:47:29.560 from the classes like what makes
00:47:32.020 somebody go you know I think I should
00:47:33.580 take the classes because these videos
00:47:35.560 can only offer so much or is it is like
00:47:37.780 a way more intense dense because I so
00:47:43.470 YouTube videos are more general
00:47:46.720 beginners for people that just want to
00:47:48.580 get in the market and they don't know
00:47:49.780 what even stock market is and you can
00:47:52.840 listen some general opinions and what
00:47:55.540 should you or should not do
00:47:56.830 find your voice on beginning mistakes
00:47:58.660 there and there but if you really want
00:48:00.310 to get into pattern statistics and real
00:48:02.290 convince courses that just teach you the
00:48:05.050 patterns then yeah I'm saying that's
00:48:07.990 where the paid courses come again yeah I
00:48:10.810 really wish we had you here at 9:30 so
00:48:13.330 we got a watch to just do it yeah howdy
00:48:16.120 here right before after yeah I wish I
00:48:19.360 would have just seen it just to be like
00:48:20.980 oh okay
00:48:21.820 it's like that not that I would
00:48:23.200 understand how to do it just as like
00:48:24.610 visually just see you do it yeah and
00:48:26.800 then be like okay let's do the podcast I
00:48:28.540 just made 30 grand so cool would you say
00:48:32.380 that a majority of your income comes
00:48:33.760 from trading versus like your your other
00:48:36.100 business with the teaching trading
00:48:38.860 accountant of trading makes more money
00:48:40.810 and compared what percentage probably 70
00:48:50.170 percent 80 percent yeah mm-hmm it's not
00:48:53.860 the service is not started to I want to
00:48:56.860 make money from people
00:48:58.030 yeah yeah it's not dedicated in that
00:49:00.040 yeah but I mean eventually I mean if
00:49:02.290 you're putting in the time to build it
00:49:03.880 out and and run it yeah you have to
00:49:06.490 there has to be some read it's not a
00:49:08.140 charity
00:49:08.800 yeah right so I mean it makes sense it's
00:49:11.050 a business at the same time earlier he
00:49:12.880 said he wants like when you pay for
00:49:14.260 something now give it worth so that's
00:49:16.600 what it's true yeah true that's mainly
00:49:18.670 what it's for yeah yeah yeah well I mean
00:49:22.960 that's interesting we have some
00:49:24.250 questions from fans okay you mind
00:49:27.490 answering here we have one from Ji Young
00:49:29.440 here when do you believe the next
00:49:31.450 financial downturn will happen and
00:49:33.460 should we wait to begin investing until
00:49:35.170 that happens kind of like what I guess
00:49:36.610 Warren Buffett does right yes but when
00:49:38.350 it was really cheap and then yeah
00:49:39.970 so there's because when I trade while
00:49:43.540 micro cap stocks they don't have any
00:49:45.070 correlations being on well compared to
00:49:46.960 the entire market so when the market
00:49:48.850 goes down we rub it doesn't really
00:49:50.110 affect this affect the stock what I'm
00:49:52.180 trading so that's something that you can
00:49:54.640 be really safe to learn to trade and
00:49:57.880 also you can learn how to really trade
00:49:59.710 in on terms so financial process happens
00:50:01.690 every 10 years so we're at that mark
00:50:03.460 consistently consistently yeah okay so
00:50:05.560 it's coming soon soon yeah so I mean but
00:50:08.470 in your it's almost the opposite for you
00:50:10.690 right all right correct me if I'm wrong
00:50:11.830 but you're waiting to people over invest
00:50:15.010 and then you short right you don't go
00:50:17.290 against that yeah so you're not waiting
00:50:19.300 till it's well I guess it would be at
00:50:21.070 the same time right when the market is
00:50:22.900 bad then more people invest is that how
00:50:25.390 it works okay let me give you examples
00:50:27.250 it's very easy to understand okay and
00:50:29.260 okay let's start from the beginning so
00:50:31.930 when it stopped when this stock is going
00:50:34.030 up the first time and a lot of people
00:50:36.910 are telling your friends okay well
00:50:38.560 invest in stock the stock went from it's
00:50:41.020 the new Tesla and stock went from 1 to
00:50:44.350 10 and you tracked a lot of people to
00:50:48.280 invest the stock now well the company
00:50:50.860 didn't do that gun stock went from 10 to
00:50:52.750 1 and all of your stuck at 10 so the
00:50:57.460 next time with stock bounces to 10 go
00:51:00.130 spectacles to 10 again after 2 years you
00:51:02.470 guys are tired of holding and the stock
00:51:04.810 goes back to 10 I was short a because
00:51:06.250 you guys will sell you guys don't want
00:51:07.870 to hold out that's one more pattern that
00:51:09.520 you've recognized but when I'm shorting
00:51:11.350 it there's still people buying at 10
00:51:12.670 because they think always gonna be
00:51:14.680 potentially break through 10 and that
00:51:16.990 time we trap will trap new people into
00:51:19.750 at 10 right
00:51:20.980 and when stock goes against the time
00:51:22.720 again will cause a certain chain
00:51:24.670 reactions will
00:51:25.720 keep coughing are you like coughing is
00:51:28.390 it very rare that you're wrong about
00:51:29.890 that like let's say something it is the
00:51:32.200 next Tesla lately it yeah like how often
00:51:34.150 does that happen to you one not a 50
00:51:35.950 very rare yeah so we're betting the
00:51:38.800 percentages so this kind of happened
00:51:40.570 with Bitcoin right wait what's your idea
00:51:42.610 like we remember when there was such a
00:51:43.780 big I mean I'm sure you know it was such
00:51:46.000 a big thing we crypto right yes it was
00:51:48.520 at I think our friends were like oh it
00:51:51.100 was at well I don't remember them didn't
00:51:53.110 20 he was really yeah but it was like a
00:51:55.240 10 when I was super popular and then it
00:51:57.580 went up to 20 yeah and people were still
00:51:59.590 buying along the way even our friends
00:52:01.300 were buying her on like 10 went up to 20
00:52:03.580 and they were still holding on to it and
00:52:04.690 people were saying it's gonna come back
00:52:05.890 down it kind of did it did I was
00:52:07.600 shooting it but okay
00:52:08.740 yeah so you you I was being part of it
00:52:11.440 yeah yeah it's same thing and so what if
00:52:13.930 though and people still believe we have
00:52:15.490 friends who still say bitcoins gonna be
00:52:17.410 the future what if it just keeps I guess
00:52:20.740 a it's just a pattern thing like you're
00:52:22.330 assuming it's never gonna come I'm not
00:52:25.030 assuming it's never gonna become big but
00:52:26.620 I think about like this so at that time
00:52:28.210 back in 20 I think it was 2017 yeah so
00:52:31.990 the big one when there's a huge hype
00:52:34.330 about it and understand the industry of
00:52:37.000 pretty much everything 90% people do
00:52:38.860 this morning so when 90 people for some
00:52:40.540 people trying to buy something you're
00:52:41.770 trying to be cool against it so that's
00:52:43.270 how you make money I see now since since
00:52:46.060 it was a huge hype and there's more
00:52:48.100 people are trapped in it so a lot of
00:52:50.080 people holding 15,000 16,000 17,000 even
00:52:53.500 though 20,000 when that goes back to
00:52:55.540 20,000 again other people will sell it's
00:52:57.790 the same psychology right so first to
00:53:00.670 recover from that many back holders
00:53:02.500 which people are holding the bag we
00:53:05.080 don't looking to sell I will take years
00:53:07.300 and years so for the next couple of
00:53:09.190 years the investor will be fighting the
00:53:11.800 pack holders for a while so you right
00:53:14.530 before this you mentioned breaking ten
00:53:16.720 so are you saying breaking 10 because 10
00:53:19.270 is a whole like a good number like a 1 0
00:53:21.700 and then like 2015 or yeah so the first
00:53:25.900 time when stock arel I'm not gonna short
00:53:27.580 it because I want to know where the bag
00:53:28.960 holder is I want to know where to start
00:53:30.400 drops once they trap enough back holders
00:53:33.400 everyone know or at this price before
00:53:35.410 looking to sell and we go stop rise and
00:53:37.780 short sell it
00:53:39.400 and people when they're people well when
00:53:41.410 people are trying to buy it at ten there
00:53:43.359 will be new people traveling again so
00:53:45.130 will cause a chain reaction next time
00:53:46.539 when people trying to buy again I was
00:53:48.730 still short selling and then mm-hmm do
00:53:51.640 it again and again again no always make
00:53:53.770 money mm-hmm until the day I'm
00:53:56.980 theoretically on to the day that it just
00:53:58.569 keeps but blows up until the day that we
00:54:01.299 were saying even then it should come
00:54:02.829 back down well until the day breaks ten
00:54:05.319 yeah then now we'll cut at ten fifty
00:54:07.390 then we just lose fifty cents out of ten
00:54:09.339 dollars talk I see right oh I see okay
00:54:14.109 there is me so I'm just trying to follow
00:54:16.089 everything in my head yeah it's like
00:54:17.410 yeah it's such a new concept right I saw
00:54:20.349 you nothing about stocks I think if I
00:54:23.140 can under I kind of understand but I
00:54:24.640 think if I can kind of understand I
00:54:27.490 think a lot of people listening will
00:54:28.869 know a lot more know people say that a
00:54:32.950 lot you know he did like the one with
00:54:34.510 Andrea I was like what does he not know
00:54:36.849 anything on this show yes we I need
00:54:41.710 things dumbed down but I did a great job
00:54:43.029 I think I understand this a lot more and
00:54:44.680 I think I appreciate the fact that
00:54:46.240 you're being very transparent even
00:54:49.839 though as a skeptic person myself I
00:54:52.029 would personally be like well how do I
00:54:53.559 know what I'm looking at because this is
00:54:55.180 confusing and we're taking it from your
00:54:57.250 words so if I had somebody verify that
00:54:59.109 doesn't know you been like oh yeah this
00:55:01.750 is legit I would probably believe it
00:55:03.279 more but I'm not I'm not questioning it
00:55:06.010 I'm yeah and I've met you now and you
00:55:08.470 seem like a very straight up dude and
00:55:09.880 you play Starcraft 2 so that helps
00:55:13.500 there's like a certain connection there
00:55:15.579 and I I don't know I think it's it's
00:55:18.160 definitely interesting and it seems like
00:55:20.109 you genuinely want to help yeah and yeah
00:55:23.890 I mean if you're gonna I wouldn't
00:55:25.569 personally I don't know enough to
00:55:27.220 encourage anyone but I think if you're
00:55:30.069 interested we can find Steven where can
00:55:32.950 they steven duck sitcom so d Steven Dux
00:55:37.569 i com QX I okay yeah Steven ducks EECOM
00:55:41.910 okay cool um did we miss anything well I
00:55:46.029 mean we do have a couple more oh yeah
00:55:48.599 questions
00:55:50.230 yeah so Eric Wynn has a question and
00:55:53.440 it's like if you gotta be combined with
00:55:55.420 a lot of other things too but it's just
00:55:56.770 like I have a 9 to 5 job that requires
00:55:59.260 me to have my full 8-hour attention but
00:56:01.750 I really want to trade and make a profit
00:56:03.340 yeah do I have to trade hourly / daily
00:56:06.700 in order to be successful okay so
00:56:09.040 there's two strategies I'm teaching why
00:56:11.890 you can be a full-time day trader one
00:56:14.140 thing can be a part-time day trader but
00:56:16.210 right now I'm leaving on part-time
00:56:17.619 because I only stay about 45 minutes so
00:56:19.690 as long as you can all take your time
00:56:22.060 and wake up at 9:00 try it until 10:00
00:56:25.090 then you're good just what is it every
00:56:27.040 day it's pretty much every day is there
00:56:29.470 a way you could do like does it or does
00:56:31.240 it just not work this way that you do
00:56:34.450 follow your stress is your strategy
00:56:35.890 based on you have to be there every day
00:56:38.830 a strategy is based on you have to be at
00:56:41.710 least 30 minutes every day every day
00:56:45.130 what if you did like a week straight and
00:56:47.290 then you skipped a couple days and then
00:56:49.359 you win another you can still skip yeah
00:56:51.130 so you can you can't skip Camus a day
00:56:53.109 that doesn't ruin your strategy oh no
00:56:55.690 okay well what about whatever at like
00:56:58.390 the beginning though you know when
00:56:59.619 they're just starting to learn because
00:57:00.940 some people aren't gonna be able to just
00:57:02.590 you know do what you did and or aren't
00:57:05.380 brave enough to necessarily just give up
00:57:07.869 what they're doing and commit to this
00:57:09.070 full-time right yes so if you're not
00:57:10.869 really committed to this beginning I
00:57:12.580 don't really recommend people to
00:57:13.750 recommit time for to learn these
00:57:16.990 strategies to learn the industries you
00:57:18.820 need a year of learning repetition yeah
00:57:21.640 for actually trading just 30 minutes to
00:57:24.850 45 yeah what about people who aren't I
00:57:27.670 mean a lot of this seems like pattern
00:57:29.350 recognition is pattern recognition
00:57:30.550 something you can learn or is there
00:57:32.410 something like it's it's like math where
00:57:33.880 you can learn the formula you can learn
00:57:35.560 the formula okay so it is like a math
00:57:37.150 it's like it's not like writing we're
00:57:38.680 like you have some people are creative
00:57:39.940 and some people just there's an answer
00:57:42.130 it's 80% math 20% I'll say sick ha
00:57:47.170 judgment judgments okay yeah in the
00:57:49.990 psychology part refers more so to
00:57:52.500 whether that day you want to like you
00:57:58.030 feels more selfish
00:57:59.560 yeah sometimes you feel more greedy
00:58:01.180 sometimes you want to make more money in
00:58:02.710 sometimes well if you
00:58:03.770 take a loss you want to make you back
00:58:04.820 here so it's it's more about discipline
00:58:06.530 right so that's what you were saying
00:58:10.070 about like people make emotional
00:58:11.990 decisions and your whole thing is don't
00:58:14.090 do that don't do your robot that's
00:58:18.920 that's definitely um interesting do you
00:58:21.200 wanna go through the list of us we got
00:58:22.520 one last one from Adi Chon do what
00:58:24.740 advice do you have for high schoolers
00:58:26.360 that want to start investing okay so for
00:58:28.790 high schoolers I don't think you can
00:58:30.290 open up a brokerage account before you
00:58:33.650 turn 21 but when I was 19 I I think I
00:58:38.420 yeah when you turn 18 you can open it up
00:58:41.480 approach broker check account but you
00:58:43.280 can't really have a margin account
00:58:44.660 what's a brokerage account a brokerage
00:58:46.190 account just have an account you need
00:58:47.870 trade and okay it's just like to get in
00:58:49.940 like the program your unit is due to
00:58:52.070 open up you have to be 21 to 18 18 and
00:58:55.820 you need to when you turn 21 can have a
00:58:57.560 margin account which means you have a
00:58:58.850 leverage you can borrow money in from
00:59:00.320 the brokerage I don't know which allows
00:59:03.170 you to short which allows you to short
00:59:04.940 okay so okay but you're not borrowing
00:59:06.830 from nothing you're borrowing from the
00:59:08.210 money that you've already put in the
00:59:09.380 yeah yeah so you can't short until your
00:59:12.140 until you have that margin account
00:59:14.030 account
00:59:14.510 yes uni that's your strategy restaurants
00:59:17.030 but you can use your parents do count

# Tim Sykes Trading Challenge Review: A 22-Year-Old With $900,000+ In Profits
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/Li3-NwAj6t4

00:00:07.900 [Music]
00:00:20.290 [Music]
00:00:25.800 what's up Tim syes millionaire mentor and Trader here with the man Steven
00:00:31.399 congratulations $900,000 in profits in one year from what did you start with uh
00:00:38.200 27,000 and starting started last Fe last year February yeah so this is March so a
00:00:44.760 year and one month 27,000 to 900,000 mhm what is your secret tell us how do you
00:00:51.680 do this you wait for the perfect opportunity and
00:00:57.239 you just need to wait and wait and wait wait for opportunity fits every single
00:01:02.640 of your criteria uh then you go for the trade what is your criteria how do you
00:01:08.520 determine what is a good versus a not good setup you build a spreadsheet you know what you're good at what what
00:01:14.080 you're good at what you're bad at and you're are trying to improve what you're bad at and trying to advance what you're
00:01:20.600 good at so you're kind of like Tim grani where you know Tim grani has a lot of spreadsheets and he he's only taken
00:01:26.360 1,500 into like 4 million in 5 years he was formerly my top student I don't know
00:01:31.439 now you're coming up on him how many spreadsheets do you have versus how many does Tim grani have are you going to
00:01:37.799 guys going to have like a spreadsheet battle um like dancers have like a dance off like rappers have like a rap battle
00:01:44.920 we you nerds have like a spreadsheet battle I do have couple of thousand
00:01:50.119 spreadsheet of data of course uh so I
00:01:55.200 record even though I'm not trading I'm recording what's the what what's the
00:02:00.280 pattern works the best yeah and I'm taking that percentage into my trading
00:02:06.600 that that's how I make large amount of money at once because I never lose never lose I don't I don't lose that much
00:02:13.160 because there's so much there's almost 90% there's one pattern has 90% I saw
00:02:18.760 the winning percentage I saw that looking through your trades you said 87% winning percentage right mhm so what is
00:02:25.360 this one pattern that's 87% probability of success
00:02:30.440 okay there's three patterns that works 85% of the time number one it's first
00:02:38.720 red day yes number two is De buying huge panics yes number three this one has to
00:02:47.239 fit a lot of details and with a lot of experience of shorting spikes number
00:02:54.560 four used to work really well but now in this B market doesn't work that well anymore it's it's called Shor in
00:03:00.800 parabolics but right now the etm
00:03:06.280 zsan and one of the uh inl happened yesterday destroyed all the parabolic
00:03:13.680 short sellers yeah so that patterns is start not working so you find that
00:03:19.239 patterns work for a little bit and then they stop working but these other three patterns work pretty much every time
00:03:25.519 every single time M these are patterns for my penny stocking framework DVD uh you must like that
00:03:30.959 DVD yes I did I did how many times have you watched it give people watching this
00:03:36.959 like what were the steps that you took to learn all this because a lot of people start with 27,000 and they don't
00:03:42.080 go to 900,000 they don't even go to 990,000 how did you learn all this so quickly what was the steps you took I
00:03:49.239 was majoring environmental engineering it was so much stress and there's so
00:03:55.159 much difficult classes I have to take so I how old are you right now by the way 22 so you're 22 you started with me when
00:04:01.640 you were 21 yes okay sorry go ahead and I'm just thinking doing something more
00:04:07.480 and I heard about the stock market and I heard about you yeah how did you find me
00:04:14.079 Instagram ah Instagram nice I didn't thought you a scammer I never doubted
00:04:20.519 you before because I heard what what you're saying it's actually with your
00:04:25.800 logic is actually helping people yeah and so it's not for something like are
00:04:31.120 learning something I'm buying this I'm buying that and I start to get into it I start learning your mentality awesome
00:04:39.160 and I'm start learning when you are well when you're going to buy so I'm buying
00:04:46.039 before you cool so so could you predict my alerts ahead of time yes ah so so I'm
00:04:52.280 starting getting your mentalities and that's where I started getting little profits from very nice have to be smart
00:05:00.680 yeah yeah of course then I started looking to uh I said oh I want to do I want to make bigger money I see tinger
00:05:06.400 and Michael good and yeah Mark Crook and see I see there's I'm I'm start noticing
00:05:13.280 the patterns starting I think the first Supernova trade is prgn oh
00:05:19.520 yeah and I then I see all not all supernovas
00:05:24.800 run five days or six days um but there's going to be one pattern that five days
00:05:31.759 or six days I can put uh not all my money is on but I can
00:05:36.800 put almost 80% of my money to build my account yeah and I use that pattern to
00:05:42.600 build my account because the pattern repeats all again and again again it's it never changes and it's crazy right
00:05:49.960 it's crazy a lot of the patterns are in Tim Gran's trading tickers DVD did you like that one trading tier has helped me
00:05:56.759 like tremendously yeah right uhhuh he's amazing how much much like he gives back
00:06:01.800 to the community and his webinars too did you watch all of his challenge webinars I watch all his chall I know
00:06:07.360 you said you told me you were studying on the toilet and I'm sorry I told everybody now people tweet me pictures

00:06:32.039 actually get stuff down really uh I actually take notes on the toilet so you multitask so you're on the toilet you're
00:06:38.440 doing your business and you're taking notes mhm that's you're a talented man I
00:06:43.479 like to think I I don't like to study I like to think why we're why we're studying yeah so you find the
00:06:51.000 fundamental of it then that that's where started yeah so you're like a philosophy

00:12:29.519 on the way down nice so I covered at like uh I short at 3 no I short at 3.7
00:12:37.079 covered three and got a bounce to three 3.5 and covered at 2.4 wow that's
00:12:43.680 awesome yeah so I mean I also see you in the chat room in the challenge chat room and thank you so much for helping like
00:12:50.120 you know you're helping Mentor other people like I see you answering questions you need to be a little more selfish like focus on you you're already
00:12:56.760 a double major you're already trying to make millions of dollars is like calm down I see people making stupid mistakes
00:13:03.360 I know it's I see people shorting AUP like why do you short a entire chat rooms got destroyed to be
00:13:10.839 fair on that so they're influenced by group think you know like when a lot of people are shorting a stock they're like
00:13:17.160 oh let me short too you can't let Alerts get your alerts and and anybody else you
00:13:23.519 have to be self-sufficient yeah and this is what you're you know not just preaching you're practicing uhhuh also I
00:13:29.480 tried to to short after offering it never worked for me so I didn't ins a this time yeah no I mean uh what was it
00:13:36.560 tgtx just kept going they did an offering and it keeps going and AKA oh now it's $27 I was shorting that 13 yeah
00:13:45.199 yeah so what have you learned about short selling that you know you think would be a good tip for people because I
00:13:51.920 see some people there's a flawed strategy I think that's out there where you just short these plays and the
00:13:57.519 higher it goes you short more and more cuz they're always going to come down and in the past 6 months this has destroyed a lot of people uhhuh what do
00:14:04.880 you think so when you trying to shore a low flow especially a low flow
00:14:11.759 right now under 10 million flow you can't shore on the front side of move you have to wait for the momentum snap
00:14:18.600 and you wait for the back side of move yeah and because right right now the Supernova goes a lot higher than before
00:14:24.839 and you can still make that much money when there backside move so don't why why you rush it in so how do you determine the back side from the front
00:14:31.040 side what's the the key indicator that you use uh either the stocks go red or
00:14:37.320 the stocks has a huge panic in the morning yeah even if it comes back but
00:14:42.720 it doesn't finish at its highs that Panic is the the crack uhhuh you want to see uh on stock to trade stock to trade
00:14:49.920 there's volume bars underneath so you want to see where's the RIT rum bar the most and you can see where all the back
00:14:55.959 ORD is yeah no I've seen your video lessons do you like stocks to trade software mhm you like the tools I've been using them since
00:15:03.040 starting and we're adding more features to it too so just you can you can you
00:15:08.800 know give us tips too cuz you're going to be like a power user so whatever you
00:15:14.480 need we'll build we have a whole programming team uh I think stock St is really good right now sometimes do a
00:15:21.519 little bit bugs yeah but like like the software is perfect we're working on it it's brand new still but I like that you
00:15:28.519 say you know you're looking for the red day you're looking for the Panic do you use any like crazy technicals like
00:15:34.160 Binger bands and RSI and ma no no thank you do not use all these crazy technical
00:15:42.319 indicators it's amazing how many people they're like what do you think about this like I'm like i' I've never used
00:15:47.600 that in my life uhhuh I don't know see actually at first I TR was I got your
00:15:53.560 book I was flipping and learning them like okay we don't use any indicators that's that's easy for me because my
00:15:59.319 languages was bad I can't understand those so English is what your third or fourth language fourth language fourth
00:16:06.079 language I feel I feel just unaccomplished next to
00:16:11.160 you supernovas etrm destroyed so many people I know I know etrm idxg also remember
00:16:19.800 that one idxg Dr y do you know how many people said oh in the 30s and the 40s it can never go
00:16:26.279 higher then it goes 100 I was Shing at 60 that messed me up that it it 60 quick
00:16:33.079 drop to 45 that I was looking for that mass panic yeah and it just kept going I
00:16:39.279 cut my losses at like 60 something but you cut your losses so let's talk about that cuz we talked a lot about your
00:16:44.480 gains that's awesome how do you cut your losses aside from when you're coming back speeding from a grocery store
00:16:51.560 so um I I don't really put hard stops I only use Mental stops
00:16:59.240 because people can see it you're preaching I did not tell him to say that I agree the market makers can see your
00:17:04.640 hard stops so that's why you don't want to use them because the market makers will drag the price to your hard stop
00:17:10.640 take you out and then put it right back uhhuh and you when you taking your
00:17:16.199 losses uh you have to go into the trade with a plan first yeah and you want to
00:17:21.760 know where you're going to cut your losses yeah and you can't always go in
00:17:27.000 as full positions you you have to kind of calculate when
00:17:32.960 the stock if go if the stock goes here uh and if I break this level I have to
00:17:38.160 cut my losses and what's your maximum loss but do you stick to your plan always yes I always how do you do that
00:17:44.760 because a lot of people get emotional they're like oh I don't want to stick to the plan let me just add to my position
00:17:50.160 I close my eye and I click it you close your eyes uh every time yes you have to
00:17:55.559 click it I have to close eyes I have to close my eyes how do you know you're clicking the right button I moov the
00:18:00.880 mouse to the stop okay I close my and click it so you like take one you like
00:18:06.799 bite the bullet uhhuh basically I can always make money back what's I agree so
00:18:13.320 have you had a big loss yet I had or what's your biggest loss biggest loss
00:18:18.440 was like uh biggest loss was it like 20K 25 30k is you've
00:18:26.159 made hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in your biggest loss is only 20,000 I I had B I had bunch of 20K 30k
00:18:33.960 losses I understand but in the grand scheme of things but I don't have that huge 2200k losses that's what I'm saying
00:18:39.480 so Tim grani on his way to 4 million I mean he's lost 1002 200 $300,000 you haven't had that yet cuz I
00:18:46.480 watch his TVD yeah because you learned from it so this is what I'm saying so the more that we teach I think it speeds
00:18:52.360 up your learning curve because then you can learn from our mistakes and you don't have to necessarily that's why I learned so fast that that's the reason
00:18:58.400 why so fast how many times have you watched the DVDs do you just watch it once or twice or what I watch I I don't
00:19:04.600 know how many times I watched I watch it when I'm free yeah I listen to them when I cooking stuff yeah
00:19:11.840 yeah if someone was beginning today what would you suggest for them to do over like the next month if they want to
00:19:18.159 maximize their Education First if you want to make money you have to have patient so you
00:19:24.799 what you want to learn it's you have to go over almost every
00:19:30.480 single uh person that in Te in team's team so Michael
00:19:37.360 good Mark cro uh timani uh you have to go over there all
00:19:42.600 your stuff and you can kind of get a general picture of it and the rest of the time for a month you just watch the
00:19:49.600 market who did you learn the most from out of those out of those choices or did you combine everyone I combined everyone
00:19:56.679 you you have to learn everybody's advantage to make better I agree I think that's what you should do and that's why
00:20:02.200 frankly we've we've created this team um did you learn more when you join the challenge versus you know just video
00:20:09.080 lessons do you feel do you see any difference there's huge difference like I can't compare there two it's too much
00:20:15.520 between Challenge and the video lessons why because there's people can tell you
00:20:22.120 what you do what you can't do and they you can see people putting their trades
00:20:28.080 in and and you can think why they put their trades in and if you're only doing
00:20:34.840 video lessons you can't see those live stuff no I agree and I'm glad that you you've taken the lessons and you've
00:20:41.559 learned because that's you know you're like my ideal student where we make these videos and we we hope that our
00:20:48.000 students are like not trying to copy the trades not follow trades but learn from our mentality why are we entering this
00:20:54.039 trade why are we exiting so that you can kind of model it for your own personality mhm is that what you've done
00:21:00.039 yeah do you agree with that yes cuz we're have we have different personalities yeah we do and you said you actually tweeted me
00:21:07.080 the other day and you're like thank you Tim I've taken your stuff and made it better and you're like your winning
00:21:13.440 percentage is 70% my winning percentage is 87% I thought you were fake in the in
00:21:18.960 the beginning because I was like how does this guy do everything so quickly like we've had students who have done
00:21:24.320 very well but like even Tim gratani I mean he didn't get it until like you know a year and a half
00:21:30.559 in um so when Ting orani started he started with 1500 and he started with
00:21:37.159 only watching your video lessons yeah and so he I watched his journey M good
00:21:43.080 journey and your journey and my C Journey that gives me four like three more examples for me to learn and you
00:21:50.200 have exponential learning curves then this is why technology is improving so speeds up than Tim grani yeah so you
00:21:57.240 beat Tim grani now with with the learning curve not in yeah that's what I mean that's cool okay so first month
00:22:05.679 everyone should have patience they should study all the stuff they should join the challenge this is what I'm understanding from you what's next how
00:22:13.320 do they actually how does someone actually take what they have in their head or a spreadsheet and turn it into a
00:22:18.760 strategy do you like paper trading do you think that they should paper trade or just trade small positions tra small
00:22:24.919 positions don't tra I I don't really really suggest paper trading because
00:22:30.400 it's kind of building into your emotion correct so it's not you can you can build really small position like 50 50
00:22:36.600 shares exactly starting with for me paper trading you know stocks trade has paper trading now because people first
00:22:42.799 of all they just have to get used to the volatility so it's good for them but it's not the full emotional education
00:22:48.840 the trading the the hardest part of trading is controlling your emotions yes I agree frankly why I'm so impressed
00:22:55.760 with how like you close your eyes do you close your eyes when you take profits or is it just when you cut losses I close
00:23:01.039 one eye to take profits are you serious we're going to have so many
00:23:06.640 students who are going to be like crosseyed so you close one eye to take
00:23:12.120 profits I I close double Eyes Two Coles what if you hit the wrong button what if
00:23:17.960 you're like you mean to like exit the position and then you double the position cuz your eyes are closed no I
00:23:24.000 put my mouse on the button and then close and click it why do you close your eyes because I don't want to see the red
00:23:31.840 stuff but why do you do one eye open then when you have a profit why don't you want to do both eyes open because
00:23:37.960 it's a smile face something like that it's a smile you're making a smiley face at your own computer it's we're all
00:23:44.760 nerds did you we are all nerds I agree with you on that did you start this practice right from the beginning or is
00:23:51.120 this something new I figured close your close your eyes and click cut your eyes is much easier yeah it's like jumping
00:23:58.760 out a plane like just gono like if you go skydiving yeah have you gone skydiving yes is there anything you
00:24:05.360 haven't done I need to go to Africa I went to AFA I actually went skydiving in Africa
00:24:12.440 I win South Africa that was my second time skydiving I haven't I hav never went to
00:24:19.120 Africa but you're not missing much I don't know I went to Europe and almost all around the world how many countries
00:24:25.000 have you been to are you beating me with countries too how many countries are you I'm at 112
00:24:30.760 countries 112 don't you don't you say 112 I'm like I'm a competitive person 70
00:24:37.799 80 how what have you how have you had all this time um I'm saying like travel to these
00:24:44.480 countries I'm not saying like just stayed like in an airport and been like oh take one off my box no no no travel I
00:24:50.039 ask you to travel you're 22 years old and you've been to over 70 countries I'm kind of a crazy traveler and I've been
00:24:55.919 doing this for like 20 years my dad actually to travel and he takes me to
00:25:01.120 travel so have you been traveling while you've been trading or no no cuz you're in school that was a long time ago
00:25:07.840 traveling I haven't traveled for a long time was stuck in school are you going to are you going to do anything to
00:25:13.360 celebrate your 1 million dollar I want to Tim grani went out for pizza when he
00:25:18.720 you know crossed a million dollars or no that was when he made a100 or 200,000 in a day what are you going to do when you
00:25:25.000 cross a million dollars buy a Lamborghini buy a Lamborghini no say I'll give you my Lamborghini
00:25:31.520 rides here it's not that great um what's your ultimate goal here you
00:25:37.960 know ultimate goal yeah um I find everyone has like a goal like a number
00:25:43.279 or you know some thing that they're working towards and it's good to Define that I do what I do stuff that makes me
00:25:49.720 happy makes me enjoy I don't really care about the money yeah M you don't you don't care about the
00:25:56.799 money I I don't all my millionaire students and all my top students you guys are all so humble
00:26:03.240 it's it's actually impressive that's how you should be that's the right answer if I was your professor I would give you an a my my parents teach me when I was
00:26:10.440 little you make friends not for benefits you make friends for friends so you're
00:26:15.919 doing this for the pure Challenge and the money is just a way to keep track uhhuh I will to proove my ability not
00:26:21.200 the money yeah so when do you think you'll have proven your ability when you might buy your mom a house when I beat
00:26:27.840 every sing sing go one of the team every single one in the team it's not a competition of Trader
00:26:35.240 versus Trader maybe I know it's not a competition but it's a uh how do I say it it's a personal accomplishment I get
00:26:42.960 it no that's cool you should use that as inspiration to you know push yourself how many hours a day do you study and
00:26:49.799 trade in the stock market not study in school I do think a lot i i w I was I'm
00:26:56.000 if I'm driving I'm thinking if I'm walking I'm still pay attention I don't want to hear about like oh Tim I was in a car accident I was thinking I can
00:27:03.440 multitask a lot you've been pulled over a lot you tweeted me a few weeks ago saying you got pulled over too I yeah I
00:27:10.279 get pulled over I think you should get a driver my my license got suspended or something good I think you should get a
00:27:17.200 driver I think you should just focus on thinking and trading take away going to the grocery stores take away all this
00:27:23.320 little stuff I mean I have to live like a normal person I understand but if you're thinking like this like it's
00:27:30.320 dangerous I can see you like you have like this genius inside of you and you're thinking and you're studying and
00:27:36.039 maybe you're taking notes as you drive and then you like go into like the back of a track I don't I only think when I
00:27:42.159 drive okay or I listen to video lessons you listen to video lessons when you drive uhhuh really you put on Bluetooth
00:27:48.080 and start going so that's how much you study so how much do you think you study per day like in terms of you know the
00:27:55.279 challenge video lessons webinars stuff like that I'm always trying to improve myself I'm almost study when I wake up
00:28:03.519 yeah and starting I take a little break but almost through the whole day do you sleep a lot I don't I right now I don't
00:28:10.279 sleep a lot I don't know why how many hours a night because when I'm when I'm sleeping I'm thinking about the stock market so you're a full-blown addict so
00:28:17.760 now we've seen the upside and the downside of this game I'm starting kills
00:28:23.480 I think aside from studying and trading and and your double major I think you're going to have to start going to like a a meetings like you're like an
00:28:30.799 addict I can't I can't sleep I I sleep like 3 hours a day oh my god dude you go
00:28:37.880 to you got to sleep a little more don't burn out I don't want you to burn out I I don't burn out I I just cannot stop
00:28:44.440 thinking about stock market what do you think the Market's going to do right now
00:28:50.760 I don't care I don't really care every single question you're getting the right answer
00:28:57.000 this that was the right answer by the way oh okay you're you're being tested okay you're you're correct about the
00:29:03.240 money you're correct about the studying you're correct about what the market is doing I'm very proud of you because
00:29:08.919 you're you've taken everything that I try and teach and you actually like know it like I'm not feeding you the answers
00:29:14.279 you don't need to care about how far Market goes I TR trust me you're preaching in the choir here what do you think about CNBC do you laugh at it when
00:29:21.200 they're you even watch CNBC I never I never know CNBC I don't I'm sorry CNBC I I taught him but
00:29:29.720 I didn't expect anyone to listen um you're right like they're always judging like what's the GDP what's the inflation
00:29:36.760 and it's all a guessing game and you don't know where it's going to go so you can't make that much money on it but
00:29:42.480 they dress it up it's like it's like uh you know dress up it's like entertainment you know uh at this hotel
00:29:49.080 actually there's Cabaret there's like 150 seat theater and there's like a cabaret show and that's to me that's
00:29:54.840 like what CNBC you have understand that most of the people rich people doesn't want to teach you because everything you
00:30:01.600 see like you see on Commercial they're trying to take your money if you if you
00:30:06.760 see people recommending and stuff on TV for a lot of people to see they're still
00:30:11.919 taking your money away yeah so no why you think how did you know what I
00:30:18.120 was teaching was real then how did you know that the challenge was like different and we didn't want to just take your money we actually wanted to
00:30:23.640 teach you I watched some video lessons I see I can tell yeah I really like to
00:30:31.120 think what people thinks so if I hear you talk I can kind of tell what you're
00:30:38.120 trying to say is it real or not good cuz I don't know I I talk a lot you know in
00:30:43.440 case you didn't notice but I I'm glad that at least some of you there's one kind of person that talk a lot and they
00:30:49.320 talk so much and makes everybody's mad but he talks real stuff yeah that's one of the personality so you can tell that
00:30:56.080 this is real you could tell from the I can tell from the beginning real I never doubt it before that's crazy I wish more
00:31:02.559 people how do I get more people like you do you have brothers and sisters actually my brother is trading
00:31:10.279 okay how's he doing he's 13 but he's trading don't trade when you're 13 he he
00:31:16.519 he do he does good he's 13 he shouldn't be trading he should be living so he can
00:31:21.799 be better than me oh my God you guys are so competitive I like that that's impressive give me one
00:31:28.440 one final tip or actually no give me one mistake that you see too many people making because now you you help a lot of
00:31:34.480 challenge students so you have a good kind of like data set what's the number one mistake that you see people
00:31:40.919 making being emotional they if they I see a lot of people in ch chat if they
00:31:47.480 lost money they're kind of complaining yeah but why you are complaining when
00:31:52.720 you can't you you don't trade when you can't lose so you have to be willing to
00:31:59.279 lose to trade and every loss helps further your education yes so I don't look at losses as a Bad Thing even
00:32:05.760 though it's tough I I agree yes like students get discouraged by losses like a I studied so much and I lost you know
00:32:12.360 50 bucks or 500 bucks yeah 500 bucks is like nothing in your life maybe it's
00:32:19.559 little important for your life but in the grand scheme of your life long it's nothing it's nothing in the grand scheme
00:32:25.000 of thing and you learn what not to do mhm what's number one tip that you have for people to do more of that you think
00:32:31.360 would make them more successful you have to be chilled with everything you can't get anything in your head you have to be
00:32:38.120 super rational uh if you are too eager to make
00:32:44.120 money you will not make money you will not make money everything works the opposite way so of your real life it's
00:32:52.679 literally sounds like that it's counterintuitive no uhhuh so you like my my lesson about like thinking of
00:32:58.159 yourself as a retired Trader only coming out of retirement when a play is good enough yes I only trade plays that are
00:33:05.559 perfect perfect perfect setups so how many times a day do you trade I don't
00:33:11.000 trade that much you see that uh huge amount of trade on my CP account that's
00:33:16.320 actually a bug yeah I I don't really trade that much so how many times a week do you trade like three times five times
00:33:22.320 a week I trade right I'm working on my scalp so I
00:33:29.159 trade a little bit more but I used to trade like five times a week yeah so one trade a day one trade a day even if you
00:33:35.399 had 27,000 even if you had 100 or 500,000 so this the problem for people once to open a CP account they thing CP
00:33:44.480 is so good it's unlimited it's unlimited you can short everything with great shorting power comes great shorting
00:33:50.480 responsibility and you can't take that responsibility when you are not experienced enough you will get blown
00:33:56.279 away like many TR Traders do yeah and when you start with your small account
00:34:02.639 with pattern day trador rule it's it's a good thing it's not a bad thing I don't
00:34:07.720 understand why people are thinking it's a are you serious it's are you a robot are you sent for me are you like an
00:34:14.280 Asian robot program from future Tim sent back into the past cuz you're saying all
00:34:19.960 the same stuff that I'm thinking and it's kind of freaky it's not it's not a bad thing from my perspective I worked a
00:34:26.719 a small to here then trust me it's not a bad thing yeah it's a good thing if
00:34:32.760 you're trying to practice cuz I I only make like five trades a day or five trades uh a week if you can make um
00:34:41.839 three trades a week and you do like two trades overnight and five trades a week
00:34:46.879 it's more than enough it's more than enough like you just but a lot of I think the problem is a lot of people don't know what a perfect play looks
00:34:52.359 like so they're they're stabbing in the dark you know like let me try this let me try this let me try that MH and
00:34:57.880 that's how they're trying to learn when in fact if they studied the video lessons and the webinars and the DVDs they would see the patterns what do you
00:35:04.920 think helps the most the DVDs the video lessons or the webinars what helped you understand what a perfect pattern is the
00:35:11.160 best uh the webinar works the most and uh the rest of we have to figure out
00:35:18.359 by ourself because different patterns work for different people yeah cuz I I'm
00:35:23.480 right now discovering some L strategies works really well that beat perk pattern
00:35:28.839 yeah you worked yeah almost like all the place like I I I I feel like people
00:35:34.680 needs to be serious watching it I'm trying to like teach them how to make money yeah what do you think um people
00:35:42.800 should do let's say if they're they're casually interested in the stock market what's
00:35:48.359 the first step that they should do should they join my challenge right away should they watch a DVD should they I
00:35:55.040 don't know you tell me um first thing you have to understand what
00:36:00.800 stock market is and you you go in you
00:36:06.079 you have to pay tuition for it so if you want to pay less tuition for it you join
00:36:12.800 something that can help you that you won't pay tuition to the market exactly the market paying to the market you lose
00:36:19.720 thousands tens of thousands and you still don't even know the lesson because the market doesn't tell you that because Market you always pay more tution to
00:36:26.280 Market that's awesome well congratulations man seriously thank you for everything and
00:36:32.240 and congrats on your success and one final thought for everybody okay you

00:37:07.599 like 20 years 50 years it doesn't expire but to master it it's really difficult
00:37:13.640 mastering strategy is easy mastering your emotion to control your risk level risk management is the hardest thing you
00:37:22.480 have to work on so if you want you have you need to have a good strategy

INSIDE THE MIND: 24 yr old MILLIONAIRE (Stock Trading Guru)


00:00:00
one of the very traditional Chinese Pharisees it's better to do drugs then do stock market whoa this stock trading guru just missed out on $100,000 while filming this video with us the hope was worth it so today we're here with Steven ducks he's 24 years old and famous on YouTube for being a day trading millionaire he's gonna try to explain to us how he flipped $27,000 into 3 million dollars he'll also tell you what you can learn from him and how he likes to address his doubters on the Internet let's go meet

00:00:36
the guy you know what's significant about this is that Steven you're originally from Chongqing yes Chongqing is one of like the biggest cities in China correct but since Juan and this we're here at Chongqing llame which is a Chongqing hotpot restaurant here in Pasadena and I mean the food looks amazing man yo guys I want to talk about this mushroom log right here this is crazy man she said to cut the mushroom off the log and then it's straight into the pot straight into the pot let's do it

00:01:07
so you got the most known from turning $27,000 in flipping that into three million yeah in about two years and so we're way past three million in yellow then you go to Cincinnati usually when a lot of people they want to come to America they may not choose Cincinnati yeah my parents are very traditional parents so they don't really know outside of the country so we basically got scammed by this one agent and yeah and it hooked me into like Cincinnati I'd watch so many of your interviews and

00:01:40
I didn't know that's how you end up what are your first impressions of Cincinnati you get there are you just like what the first impression is why people here so big because I was looking for a different style of Education because when I went to the Chinese school everybody knows that it's very strict but you have to study the books you have to finish the exam and get good grades that's why did you do but in here they give you the chance to create stuff then I was telling my teacher that I want to

00:02:09
do a different mechanics for the Prague's the plugs into the wall and you're just smacking you said don't think about everything about that just get good grades that's it so you were trying to innovate on the systems that were existing whether that was a new electrical idea yeah it seemed like from a young age you were always thinking a little differently yeah so how'd you learn English so well I had this one friend Stan says don't take yeah other than that I had an American girlfriend two years later so

00:02:35
that's how i yeah what are the steps between that and like yo I want to become super successful in rich and wealthy and like and make my own way at that time was how cool playing this game called Starcraft 2 I got into like very top tier and it's pretty much World Championship tournaments after that I had this one girlfriend which you guys know we broke up but I did put a lot of work in there so once it broke I'll keep thinking myself oh I need to get better okay so you felt like it was something wrong with you or yeah

00:03:11
there's something that you were lacking yeah okay so maybe I'm lacking money we're a very classic story motivated by women I'm not wrong just is sometimes I was looking for different industries to invest I don't have that much money about 20,000 when I became I really say I have to read contract and stuff like that my English was not good at that time then so I just completely ditched away the second thing I looked at is the stock market and the only thing you need to do is just to look at the chart you

00:03:41
don't need to talk to people you don't need to read stuff it's all based on technical readings and I didn't know a way of how to really use small capitals to grow into a bigger capital since $20,000 now that it's not that much money but it's not like very small amount of money so you're stuck in that very awkward zones that you have no idea how to really grow when you're trying to grow your money into all those Microsoft or Tesla it doesn't really give you really good risk or because they move so

00:04:10
slow they take years and years and years to grow what a boarder that was called large cap large cats large cap is companies that worth about 500 million or more most of time we'll see over 1 billion so those type of market caps it's very difficult for you to invest you dare you have the invest in long term or you have a lot of money of hedge or hedge funds but none of us have that kind of capital at that time I was thinking okay so if I pick a high-risk high-reward what if I could control the

00:04:38
risk then can only get a high reward so if I can control the risk of low risk and low reward if I control the risk to a very small amount I still get a little work so that's doing research and smoke caps I will say okay well how much percentage can smoke kept well in one day then I tracked about one month of Statistics that small cap can grow 2,000 percent in your day so if you can in fact have 20,000 catch that 2,000 percent I can grow $20 into a lot of money first trade I got extremely lucky

00:05:10
I think I invested about 12,000 and made 40,000 the first day I went into a small cap of course the second I think the third trade that have pretty lost all the 40,000 and again from the first trade is it like gambling it's not gambling to be honest I've been tracking the statistics for almost five years the pattern that I've been tracking has about some of them has a 93% winning percentage so if I see this type of pattern at sizing at least 300,000 and then make 150,000 per day it doesn't

00:05:41
really happen that often happens about five times a year if you develop it or you your some of it I developed it some of I didn't but I some of I improved the place down the basics yeah a lot of you asking me okay so what if you're making this much amount of money let's say three million to five million per year per year while are you now working for a hedge fund very good question also I can kill of a Gila over life for hedge funds you're holding somebody else's money so if you

00:06:08
win that's good if you lose you're losing somebody else's money so that's why I can't get over that you did get invited of a hedge fund before but that's not for me so you're not making the most money you possibly can because I don't have that that think of money to make twenty million dollars per day but it will take me years and years to develop a new different pattern because the pattern doesn't really work on the bigger mmm so you have to innovate more patterns and that's just a whole

00:06:35
different world right yeah so even where it's more competitive to when you're being pattern real quick what is a pattern pattern is I'd say every time when stock hits this specific level it goes down and you can repeat 80 times and the 60% of the time or 70 70 percent of the time they weren't so that caught me called the pattern so you got a fix in the game no not a fix I was able to calculate certain patterns using algorithms the passage are visual right patterns are visual yeah okay so there it's literally

00:07:04
like a graph it's a graph so you're basically looking at the numbers and the visual data and coming up with a way to track the spikes and predict the spikes correct yeah that's the expenditure would you call yourself an independent stock trading team it's like a retail trader retail trade yeah so I started to build my own data - based on the first win trade that okay I want to trap this one trade similar market cap similar action similar pattern similar charts everything is similar I want to track

00:07:36
what's the exactly winning percentage on this specific pattern that I just did I'm not to trade so the perfect perfect entry for me for further system is - if his machine does it and for human is about 1.5 so once you look at the human reaction weight and you look at the Machine reaction then you can find that okay water is about 0.5 gap now next time we're going to try to improve based on the human action so then we're going to get 1.7 1.8 getting closer to the perfect system so are you saying your

00:08:06
ability your huge advantage was that your part machine yes I will say the more machine like you can think machine like you think yeah rational thinking one of the keys and you guys you always talk about this is like taking the emotion out of it yeah when you get emotional you make irrational decisions you rush through things you panic you get frantic those are all things you want to avoid when you're dealing with it's not my money yeah be honest like I try to dip my toes in stocks a little

00:08:35
bit with just on the app and even me I was like checking I was like aha it went down today keeps going to all weekend it still went down here and I'm just like sucks and then already I was like oh I'm being so emotional about this I'm so not Steven right now people go into the stock market and Brian they don't know what the stock market is they don't know what bigger cap or smoke appears you don't even know the terminology and when they go and they just basically throw money at people that uh look like us

00:09:03
right I think exactly what I did you what you're saying is pretty much the average behavior and forgive me for my language I'm gonna call these people your average Joe dump and the reason I can call them that is because when it comes that's me I am average Joe dumb now that I'm a dumb person in like every aspect of my life but when it comes to the financial instruments and financial worlds like any cap you're talking about a small cap mid cap large cap I don't really know anything I lost a bunch of

00:09:35
money on crypto and I you don't really know about Krypton is I really didn't know I watched like three videos and I've read like three pages you know like summaries and it peaked when I was in New York it peaked that like what is nineteen twenty and I got it on the way down and I was like oh yeah I gotta get in on this game this is it and then it went down even more it's a six thousand so can you explain to me what I was thinking as mr. average Joe dumped all the social media that not

00:10:03
just you guys those people that heard about Bitcoin is pretty much our mom's and stuff like that they have no idea even I have a clue of what bitcoin is and it cause like a chain reaction of people punching with it basically chasing the stock now sheep sheep are chasing the Sheep are chasing so now one of the very important behavior of stocks is you can see the stock trend this starts to speeding up that means people are getting emotional when the stock is spiking people are feel like okay oh oh

00:10:33
god I missed the action and indicator in this game ripped when the stock starts to speeding up there's more volume going name but more Vong is more bitcoin ejected into the stock market when the star speeds to the certain point and you can track that how far were how much percentage beginning of the like the slower train spikes and starting with that you can trace out that starting point and track the end point for any type of industries typically they speed up a Polock say generally 50% 70% and that's 70% you're

00:11:02
looking for the first people who sell so typically when a stop come up there a huge spike they fall over the huge downtrend right cuz people are other people who bought it early are like this is my time to exit like a bunch of money right yeah and people who are chased they say oh god is dropping some sell sells herself so when they killed sell and cause a huge downtrend and a lot of people did not get out of the retail traders like you guys are stuck at the top of the game at the top of the Bitcoin and they didn't get out still

00:11:35
have been gone when the stop bounce this a little bit I know okay well there's people do not get out when they part of 20,000 I'm gonna short it when you buy a stock you expect the price to go up on the other hand when you short a stock you expect the price to go down here comes the mentality I bought a 20,000 the stock drop to 15,000 was oh god I got a sale and I can not sell right here I'm gonna sell when I maybe get close to color even and I'm out of this game so when first the soft spikes you will

00:11:59
crash again because you are selling at that point be the one color even that's why I beg gainst it then stack those six out so you very much have a very strong grip of understanding of what mr. average Joe dumb is thinking yeah if it goes bust you can make ten to one even twenty to one return no way and no one's paying attention because I'm I used to be a mr. Joe down so I started from the beginning I know exactly what you guys thinking because you guys are like me okay so one of the

00:12:26
very important investing advice for like all of you guys is 90% of people who are investing in stock market lose money and that 10% of the people always are doing the opposite but 90% of the people are doing so if you think ok all my people all the people all my friends and family around around me are talking about bitcoins are buying it you know there are 90 percent so you need to do the opposite when they're buying bitcoins you need to not to buy because I should have talked to you like two years ago

00:12:56
about hello you know what it was Dave we're like looking up NBA highlights and we're like hey should we get the Bitcoin yeah yeah maybe we should that's not how you make money from Bitcoin mr. Joe dumb boom obviously mr. Joe dump probably got MSNBC or CNBC or whatever you know Bloomberg on but yeah but what do you think of that if I'm doing the opposite the way of whether it's saying I can wait about 60% of the time so that means they're right 40 percent of the time yeah you know and lower even lower

00:13:27
that's average based on prevailing sentiment the market banks in popular culture yes it's full estimate but everyone's wrong Steven this was such a dope thing to eat Chongqing hotpot with you do you think we can go can you help us move past the job is to help make us help unload on us guys on another note this hot pot it was really good really good and guess what that spicy side it's really freakin spicy man yeah a little bit more flavor and Chintu is a little bit more spicy yeah yeah I'm just saying

00:14:05
man they give you the fresh mushroom log yeah I look like a bag yet all right guys we're gonna finish up eating and then we are gonna get really technical and Steven is gonna help us take the first step out of the dump all right Steven we are here in an office and behind us is your stock trading platform lives straight from your computer yeah things are going on and something crazy just happened I was talking to one of my students that when this table gets close to that since on fire area a we was

00:14:39
short now so this is when you would attack this is where I would attack at 7:00 then I look at where they're at he's at 3.5 so by filming this video I lost about 150 thousand I lost of all war Wow right so on this part Stevens gonna actually explain how on the car ride up from Orange County today he missed an opportunity to profit a hundred thousand dollars and these opportunities don't come around every day typically with this is patterns color one of the pattern coach got offshore and it's very one of the very

00:15:11
restricted criterias and you pretty much MIT about every single criteria only we call the high of 7.5% when South drops about 75% I'll be some again we push us to to the high and a little bit close to the high so you want to live a little bit inch and the pic of a round number which is around seven so you could put a seven line that's right that's exactly where the entry is so if you short it here sides a little bit they'd say 30,000 shares of 40,000 shares so you make about three to four

00:15:43
dollars per share 40,000 times four that's 160 thousand that's the topic you saw a second spike and the second spike wasn't as high as the first spike which leads you to believe there was gonna be a steep drop-off yes now if you take a deep look of this chart all right so when you look at the stock market as soon as the market open right you see a huge drop your emotional so people who Bob at open got fat so they say I bought a six point two then I dropped about 5.5 I'm nervous oh you're panicking I'm panicking in

00:16:12
your head you order long it's got it's gonna drop more so I see the stock coming back I said oh I feel good after good lot of myself and once the stock keeps going keeps going then once it hits to a certain point and people right here starting taking profits because I don't want to hold this anymore because I already entered out around 6 and we just see this huge red candle pop down they say Oh God because this one was so fat this one was about 30 seconds so when it within 30 seconds the sight

00:16:39
drops about $1 you gotta be panicking so this the next reaction for you will be selling selling the stock so cause chain reactions cameras and chips trimming down these people keep buying it and people are back where I keep setting it down do the people and the small caps do they know anything about Austin innovation do they know what it does like do you study it or you like I don't even know what they're selling this company now I have no idea what's the coming to do no right you don't have to

00:17:06
know anything about the company no not the note if they got a new product coming out or if their CEOs about to step down no you're just looking at the pattern 0 because by general statistics statistics 99% of the micro cap always fails so my crew cabs eats around under 100 median so you qualifies as a small kappa smoke count always fell you know losers only worth 25 million yes so it's very volatile yes the crap like maybe let's can we pull up like a big cat company and see that it doesn't look like this

00:17:38
today correct yes now this is a bigger cat it's worth about 38 billion okay and you see the the the the range of moving this Tesla right here yeah so 219 goes through 212 if you enter here and exit only makes $7 out of $200 stock right so that's about what 2% but since as a retail trader we don't have that much money so buying this it doesn't have it has pretty much a zero risk reward so it's basically like if you have a small amount of money is better to play the smaller companies

00:18:08
yeah because how many shares can I afford let's say I can only buy ten ten of of Tesla yeah then I'm even if I short it ice mate only it's a ten then you you short here you buy here you make $7 so seven times ten you make seventy bucks per day this is basically why you would never de trade these gigantic stocks like the s l-- a-- and amazon yeah you you invested twenty thousand you made seventy seventy bucks where did your parents say when you first were like you know what i'm gonna go into

00:18:35
small caps oh it's a lot more volatile a lot more risk reward goes up but i'm i devised the plan to get more reward than this at this said it's better one of the very traditional chinese parent says it's better to do drugs then do stock market what about the Chinese stock market is there any money to be made there okay what you do a Chinese stock market it will it's regulated so the maximum moving up percentage would be ten percent per day that's the maximum you moves to ten percent then stop money

00:19:07
stops for you today and if he moves down 10 percent salamanca stops for you today so this one is free movements so you can move 50 percent down on one day so you can make that gigantic risk of working one day is it because China wants to kind of limit the volatility where they don't want the crazy gains and crazy loss it's controlled market for your style of investing that you've innovated and developed what is the base amount that people need to be able to like even begin to test the waters ah five

00:19:37
thousand are there in five thousand so so let's say five hundred dollars what should I do with $500 is there anything I can do on any platform form that would at least be helpful to me okay so if you have $500 you got to be really careful with the Commission's because some of the broken rib groups Commission's so right they get money per trade they get money per trade attack etrade a sure trader or Robin Hood those three brokers you need need to stay away with if you have like a very small

00:20:08
amount of money so it was $500 micro tab I think is for you micro cap micros that's smaller than small there's smaller and spoke caps and you can focus on either you go extreme like billions of dollars of market cap then you did buy because dip goes much better compared to small caps if you are using the say a billion dollar cap loses 20 percent in one day then you did buy you have much better chance to make money and for micro cap see sometimes in moves to thousands of percent if you get lucky

00:20:39
you can make a lot lot of people say the micro caps I think are like the little startups that just started that maybe have a chance to go now microcast is anywhere between like under 10 million so first you have to pick the right market Nasdaq a New York exchange and OTC you to now I want to pick o TC I'm Pink Sheets and that's not for you execution would be extremely bad so I'll recommend and as that go me alright when I start it I spend about 10 hours a day 365 days I did not take a break zero

00:21:06
break so people thought I was crazy because there's like charts on the walls like a mad scientist at MIT like beautiful we can try to everywhere the creating patterns will be a little bit more difficult than learning the pattern so I would say I already create a pattern people only have only come sooner and then will be much quicker for them to marry instead of trying to create a pattern let me show you a little bit more extreme so today look at this drama whoa nine to four look at how much a wrench that can be make per day

00:21:35
right this is apply this is a RCI and it's work this is a micro cap right season I can't cook worth less than 10 million yen correct so what what happen made a lot of money here yeah but you didn't see is this a pattern this one happening right out through that people wants to buy breakouts so when it break how happens is to pass the yesterday hi some people who buy the breakout above similar area and when it goes down under similar area I know those people who bought the breakout are all trapped when they tribe

00:22:03
they want to sell when they sell I will add a nice steady pressure victim panicky more so that's how I parent so I probably show around 67 area and make about $3 per share pretty much about 35% of its own game with the investment if you were watching this and you saw it jump to 9 I want to be touching this is not touching because you you don't know where the backer is you don't know where people are holding and you know where people are trapped as soon as the reaction happens you know where the

00:22:33
right so you want to be patient wait and see wait and see we're insane see that's where a patient that's what people always say impatient in fishing is a smart word for trading the market because sometimes we've been patient and not looking for the right pattern you steal this money so what what pattern is this this pattern was like losing momentum for micro caps one of the is this is not a very specific pattern this is fake outs for market cap and losses entire momentum you know it's funny when you

00:23:02
talk about stocks it's like I don't know if you guys have ever watched when when Kobe Bryant is breaking down on his offensive possessions on uninterrupted like he just killed but yeah when Kobe Bryant is just breaking down every single possession when he's like ok my man was to the left he had his right foot back so I jabbed stepped here and I knew that he was gonna back up 2 inches because I had just driven you know got a layup on him previously so I knew I'm gonna pull up for the jumper and he's gonna give me

00:23:28
enough space it's almost like hearing a savant like Kobe Bryant is a basketballs upon you or is my dog stuff on you're just breaking down everything pretty much predicted yeah what I do is when I track those patterns I will track the frequency of the pattern how much how many times they happen per year I can generate a sheets that how much money I can make it's a similar it again how much money I can make per year so if I miss a play or I messed up a play I won't be getting emotional because I know this is how

00:23:55
much money I can make you reach I mean you could read it you could we can read it you could read the matrix that's but but you're saying that with any amount of study a person can't also learn to read the matrix yes so Alice a people can needs too about like two hours to four hours it would take them like a year to to pretty much get all of the technicals yeah what is a a hard stop or heart out and you said you don't recommend it is that what you're shorting something and what does

00:24:21
that mean like especially on this arci in this ticker when you want you want to short you do not want to sure like when it's on the breakout because you don't see any movement and you don't see any pattern this is why you are trading basically by reacting but that one OSN it's pretty much predicted so you will know that you've exact the statistics because it was more spikes right yeah they fit a pattern it fit a pattern by that one it's it doesn't really fit a pattern so you can kind of pick that

00:24:50
which one has a pattern which one doesn't have a pattern so which the one doesn't have pattern it's more risky that's why you shouldn't be shorting we just said do you have a criteria that something has to fit before you go in yes and what you have to make sure it hits every single cut to green-light yes but what is it is it a common mistake that somebody goes okay hit five out of six green lights I'm still going in students always do that always do that they always do it's it's every time and

00:25:15
to remind them please make sure you follow every single cut you have before you make a trade you said your female students tend to wait all that green criteria are hit yeah more than the males are more patient I feel like maybe their lot is not as greedy not experienced man yeah you don't really need to hit a home run every single trade you can't make decent trade about 30 times per year to make above 200 to 300 thousand per year based on what there he does investment we want to talk about some of the criticism that people

00:25:44
have on the Internet what's one of the main criticisms that people say I'll say I'm not real and you're no they're saying your profits are fake everything's not true but here it shows exactly how much this is literally a statement a statement per I'm one month where's my name right here I said whose is mine say your name is do Shushan yeah that's my name so the reason why my name is Steven Ducks is that that's why so that's my last name and there are tricking people so now you can see the

00:26:17
beginning value of February 20 we'll be 40,000 so I start the account with 40,000 right the end of the March 31st value is 290 mm so in one month I turned 40 thousand into 290 mm this is mother I'm showing you that it's possible to turn a small account into a big account in one month and it doesn't I'm not even talking about here where would you rank this as far as like how good you did like this one's probably or one of the best but it's not how much capital I have this isn't what I was

00:26:49
placing a bet with my friend he said I don't believe you show me how you did it this is an eye broker that I use called trade zero this is from January first you 29 to be January 31st right now you can see net profit so a net profit go if it goes down we'll be two hundred fifty two hundred forty three thousand my name that's my account number so I put it out there like would you say this is generally how a successful sheet would look like this well zeros gains losses more more there's always a nonsense

00:27:21
there's an you can't really avoid losses now in the market as long as you want more than you do we read a lot of the comments and we're looking for some more criticism so we found some in some of these are comical some of them are funny comments and some of them are trying to dig deeper and try to find something but one of them is like oh man you must be of this Chinese mafia I'm not a Chinese mafia as for lesson number one let's say let's say a proof I have a lot of money

00:27:48
and at the beginning but bad statements is showed I had $40,000 at the beginning and grow to 290 mm so even though I have a lot of money I don't have the skill to grow that so so you're saying even if you're you inherited a bunch of money yeah if that was true then you can still show people you have the skills the knowledge in the pages whereas you still owe to the 42 to 9 make money why would you sell programs and why would you try to teach people if you're already right sure that's a very interesting like

00:28:17
thing because I started this education service as a good intention because you can see my statements I can I can make 200 to 300 thousand dollars in one month easily so in times like times a year it's about 3 min to 4 min darks to 3 min does it comes to conservatively and per year and when I make this educational program because the first thing that went through at the very beginning of my career I spent a lot of money as a broke college students you don't have that much money as 14,000 but

00:28:45
basically use my tuition for the stock market and almost has haven't had enough to pay me enough to pay my tuition so I don't want people to go through the same stage that like went on cuz you went through a rough learning phase and lost a lot of money yeah this is BS these patterns I found on the market scribble down some pages no there are armies of PhD quants looking alike things like this and the bottom line is simply these patterns don't exist the kind of day trading is doing is heavily penalized by

00:29:17
the tax system in the brokerage houses it's corrupt but that's the game you're not only have to beat the market but beat it by way more than institutional investors to see any real gains if you're day trading look at the institution people that say it's probably called hedge funds they have millions of dollars and hundreds of meaning of dollars in this market when they invest into this specific battle caps most micro calves were tends to go to zero they're what you offer in two

00:29:41
warrants and all type of stuff when they invest no matter how much money you will get taken out by the company itself so it's basically they are you investing your empty shell company that's why these institutions every never wants to go into this type of play for the patterns we can go check your statistics by yourself what if someone says but stop quite that simple because even if Steven makes 50k in a day he's going to get a short-term capital gains tax thirty eight percent right off the bat

00:30:07
the tax percentage yes that's all right there's some way you can you can deduct a short boat of fees and the Commission fees if you are you're running a LLC so that range will go down a little bit but yeah if you just brownie just using the capital guarantee that's about right percentage every Tom Dick and Harry sounds like a genius in a bull market but in a bear market Tom Dick and Harry gotta go look for regular jobs basically saying like what your tactics and patterns is it's working because there's

00:30:36
a global trend above bull market but once it goes bare it's not gonna work anymore well for that reference I'm sure it in so the morgue market is and make more money now for different market disabled mentor or bearish market the entire overall market does not have any correlation compared like coalition with the micro caps I have tracked about 20,000 samples all together it does not have an explanation so let's say the overall market is dropping today about 2 to 3 percent then the stock the micro cap stocks that can

00:31:09
still go up a thousand percent in a day there is many scenarios like that happen before 3.5 million a year from a nineteen year old stock kid ok but there's an eight year old showing his toy cars from half in kinder eggs on YouTube and making 22 million a year you got wonder who the real brain child is the stock kid which is you or the kinder egg kid yeah there's people make a lot more money than me but there's one thing I always had an advantage I typically estate spend about 45 minutes every single day that's it and I

00:31:38
gained about 3 million dollars per year that's so much financial freedom I don't know do you see a lot of haters at the beginning before I post my account statements and showing my holidays statements and give a lot of people didn't understand that because people are like out there industry they're older than me they're 30 40 years old and see or 19 year old and do really like because they don't want to see you do it because they don't want to believe that they could have done it and they

00:32:08
did you look at them make people who are better than you and I before I started there's one guy I'm really look up to now he's one of my one of the best of friends and at that time I don't see him as like I like jealous of stuff like that I look at him like okay well a detener but he what he's telling me I need to learn the message if you don't trying to learn twenty haight you will never become better like that's just a fact I like the way you're talking about a man

00:32:35
it's no different than the way like coal he approaches basketball Kobe tries to learn the post moves from Hakeem Olajuwon he tried to run some dribble moves from Chris Paul he's really trying to be able to himself to be the best you know different people have different talent and just be that's the word modest modest in and willing to learn that people work better and it doesn't matter the father age it doesn't matter about where you coming from what was the first thing we bought with all the money

00:33:05
that you made right off the bat when I bought like a bother I bought a max trainer when I married my like first I think it was a first million then after that I bought a Ferrari 488 and after damn singing buying another the goal I'm gonna buy psycho nice egg eventually I want to go into the energy sector I want to build like free energies and go back to the engineering and stuff oh you want to go back to the engineering guys it's because at first well first it was the broke up second is I have creative minds

00:33:38
like I want to build something that I don't have enough funds to build so after that I would have built up in a founder you can build a model I want you want to go back to your first dream of even in China that you told us that story where you said hey you were telling your teacher what if we did this and be more efficient yeah she said no Steven don't think like that that's silly and then you said okay let me make millions of dollars then I'm gonna come back to this idea I don't really care

00:34:06
about my legacy I just want like I care about like how many people I can help and what I can do to this world wouldn't I like build stuff to benefit the world so that's the first meeting I do get that like buying stuff is very fun stuff like that but once you had what's the difference between let's say a $500,000 car and the million dollar car yes there's a difference but eventually just come down into showing off and as a driving tool so that stuff is like it's fleeting you get that feeling but then

00:34:39
that burst is done yeah like that instantly what you won't last over a six-month I had one thing I noticed from that the people who are really successful and almost have this outlier tears success it's never those trappings that incentivize them because it can't it can keep somebody going for a little while a year two years three years four years five years but once you get to a certain level you've got to have something else that's fueling you where can people find out more about this

00:35:07
because I had an amazing time even just researching this video and find out my website it's Stevens sitcom and there's different tiers you can choose if you are not feeling comfortable we can choose whatever ticket whatever it is you want but if you want to really like dive into dive into the market and starting with small amount of money then there's other programs you can choose I like about Steven is like did you uh you don't you just you just give it away yeah I mean transparent like I don't

00:35:35
really try to hide he is giving stuff away for free even though I give it away from my councilman take a councilman sir he actually showed you his account number is it you still will have to put in the work yourself right yes you have to Provo give ourselves I get there's no free stuff back coming but for me my biggest takeaway from talking to you is they're like you can't enter this world and not know anything about it yeah that doesn't make any sense you know what it kind of reminds me of and this is just

00:36:00
the analogies from my world when I put my brain into it's like taking a street ballplayer off like the court even though they look good and putting them in the five-on-five in the NBA where they're running all these complex NBA play actions and sets and they're icing and they're running horns and they got all these complicated plays and the street ball guy is just completely lost and he's like dude I thought basketball is basketball wrong at an NBA level the play actions are so complex people are running zones

00:36:28
they're switching schemes every other play if you don't know what's going on on the court you're gonna lose yes basically if you want to win in any game stock game or basketball and not end up like a mr. Joe gummit you've got to increase your IQ and understanding of its inner workings Stephen ducks has a website all about it you making this amount of money after putting down a mountain work and thinking and studying and preparation is not crazy it's not unbelievable but we work to make it

00:36:56
sound easy now after you do all the preparation figuring out the patterns read all the books spent money on all those courses first you know yeah you went through all that so that's why I think it's just because you're young it looks like you haven't been through anything yes right yeah you started early you went you struggled early and then you made out yeah I know it's good to hear then you want to do something else after this I think some people would think oh just keep making

00:37:20
money make make twenty million makes 30 million and then you're like maybe I will but maybe I won't maybe I want to do something else yeah it's yeah my name's not the the life goal right I don't know if you ever described your brain as a hard drive but like I said everybody kind of has a different brain right some people's hard drives are faster or some are slower some have bigger capacity some are you know not as big but at the end of the day everybody can make decisions as an adult about

00:37:47
what they want to fill the terabytes of their hard drive with what do you want to put in your hard drive definitely if you want more information check out the description and the link below tell us what you think he addressed the criticism and you want people to get at you in the comments right yeah well people have give me the quit is that some pet I don't see he's saying come at me bro he said how many more statements do you need to see aren't everybody thank you so much for watching that

00:38:10
video man we ate haha we talked about your background you talked about how to read the market how you do things and you even addressed the criticism that people have for you on the Internet and honestly to address the criticism on the Internet was an honorable thing to do because you don't have to but anyways guys I hope you guys learned something because we learned a lot and I'm sure you guys have a lot of questions if you guys have comments for Steven he'll read them but thank you so much check out his

00:38:34
information down below and until next time we out peace so talking to Steven today made me realize a few things number one most people are like us you know the 90 percent we followed what everyone else was doing and we ended up losing thousands of dollars in crypto pretty average human psychology according to Steven we know about a lot of things but stocks and crypto is not one of them that's why we are one of those mr. Joe dumped until we're not and number two there's still a lot of studying and practice

00:39:06
involved in what he does he's not just teaching you how to get rich he's teaching you how to fish and number three you have to be patient wait for an opportunity that fits the pattern then make a move getting emotional about it is only gonna lead to irrational decisions you got to think like a machine yeah I think like Steven so so I major in your environmental chemical and chemical engineering and one of the my dream of the future is you can see a lot of people in the countries and countries

00:39:35
fighting for energies never-ending whether it's fossil fuels in it if I can solve the energy that was coming from something that can generating tons of energy without causing too much of trying to fly everything country's trying to fight then I hope you might go to see that people not be fighting you still play Starcraft yeah real quick I gotta ask the you know what everybody was commenting they were saying all over all the videos you've made over the years on YouTube your English got

00:40:08
progressively better is because I'm practicing the same thing goes to the stock market

00:02:01.930 [Music]
00:02:06.079 welcome to the humble Traders podcast
00:02:07.879 Stephen hello you are a really famous
00:02:11.520 Trader on Twitter and YouTube and you
00:02:14.000 are really famously known for that I
00:02:16.120 think was the dwac where you make six
00:02:19.959 was it $6 million in one day yeah right
00:02:22.680 so I think a lot of people know you for
00:02:24.239 that and of course a lot of other
00:02:26.000 profits you've had over the years if we
00:02:28.200 could tell audience how this year
00:02:30.200 treating you so far and how are you
00:02:31.720 adjusting to the market this year is not
00:02:36.000 as good as 2021
00:02:39.599 2022 the beginning of the year was okay
00:02:43.159 uh since ever
00:02:45.200 since uh May and June I mean the later
00:02:49.000 this year is not very active yeah and uh
00:02:52.640 this year's Market has
00:02:54.519 been uh has been okay uh profitable and
00:03:00.080 not making as aggressive as money as uh
00:03:03.959 compared to
00:03:05.280 2021 uh still up in the seven figures
00:03:09.760 um and the lower seven figures okay not
00:03:14.159 crazy high approaching eight figures um
00:03:19.519 but volume has gone down about 90% 80%
00:03:23.560 compared to 2021 and 2022 the market is
00:03:26.799 become much more competitive compared to
00:03:31.159 the last two years especially on the
00:03:33.280 short side um as we know that shorting
00:03:39.120 has 90% or or has much higher winning
00:03:42.280 percentage compared to buying so
00:03:44.159 majority of the money are H or held by
00:03:46.680 shorts Setters and so if Shorts Setters
00:03:49.599 are trying to Pile in into a ticker and
00:03:52.439 there's not many Longs in there so there
00:03:55.319 uh first short Setter cover and second
00:03:56.959 short Setter cover above that so it will
00:03:58.840 cause a massive parabolic uh as we saw
00:04:01.879 in like top mhm so from my understanding
00:04:04.959 is you're predominantly a short seller
00:04:07.200 right okay I do want to ask you a little
00:04:09.319 bit later on about like specific short
00:04:11.640 strategies you're doing and how you're
00:04:13.200 using your statistics to track those
00:04:15.640 High odds as you call it um but that's
00:04:17.918 take a step back how did you get into
00:04:19.798 trading in the first place and how many
00:04:21.399 years have you been trading now I got
00:04:24.120 into trading when I was 19 so the the
00:04:27.120 freshman year of college how did I get
00:04:30.360 into trading you in school yes uh I
00:04:33.560 don't have a very good family history
00:04:36.080 but uh okay uh so at that time my mom
00:04:38.800 and dad are going through divorce um so
00:04:43.120 I was just trying to solve some of the
00:04:44.560 financial pressure from my from my mom's
00:04:47.520 side and uh I used my uh tuitions as my
00:04:52.759 base money to trade which is about which
00:04:55.400 is 25,000 yeah
00:04:58.240 so um first of all I I think at the very
00:05:01.919 beginning I lost half of it and then
00:05:04.840 then I borrow some money from my friends
00:05:07.080 started again you have rich friends not
00:05:09.600 rich friends but I had to pay interest
00:05:11.400 on that money so so okay so um but uh
00:05:16.360 and they started again uh that's where I
00:05:18.440 went from I think 27,000 to 900,000
00:05:22.240 first year then uh second year was 2.7
00:05:26.680 million third was I mean goes up from
00:05:29.880 there so so you were trading with your
00:05:31.960 tuition money and then eventually once
00:05:34.280 you start making money is that how you
00:05:35.759 paid for your school for the rest of the
00:05:37.240 college or did you drop out of college I
00:05:40.000 mean still in school and pay for the
00:05:41.520 tuition of whatever the money I made
00:05:43.560 from Trading okay and what was your
00:05:45.759 major uh engineering oh I was going to
00:05:48.800 guess either like mathematics or
00:05:51.000 engineering uh chemical engineering
00:05:54.000 chemical okay yeah so what what did you
00:05:56.400 aspire to be at the time when you were
00:05:58.479 still going through school
00:06:01.240 uh I mean I like engineering I like very
00:06:04.840 statistic based so a major and I chose
00:06:09.039 engineering and the reason why I went to
00:06:11.960 engineering I want to more Focus down
00:06:13.960 into
00:06:14.960 nanotechnology nanot technology yeah
00:06:17.440 okay uh at that time we're focused on
00:06:19.240 nanot tubes I think but uh then um I
00:06:23.080 shift my focus more into trading
00:06:26.280 afterwards so okay so how did you I
00:06:28.960 understand you were trying to make some
00:06:30.039 money to help out with a family so why
00:06:32.919 Trad in stocks and how did you discover
00:06:35.919 stock trading in the first place okay so
00:06:38.160 yeah so um well first of all 25,000 is
00:06:41.880 not a lot of money first of all as an
00:06:45.240 international students we don't I mean
00:06:48.400 our commun communication skills are not
00:06:51.520 very good compared to the the natives
00:06:54.039 people in here oh like in terms of
00:06:56.240 English in ter yeah in terms of English
00:06:58.160 so trying to do the the talk businesses
00:07:01.479 or like real estate you have to
00:07:02.960 communicate with other people so that's
00:07:05.800 you know a big I say shortage for for
00:07:08.960 some people like us and we also came in
00:07:11.479 as a F1 student so you can't really have
00:07:15.960 a
00:07:16.759 job but only in campus you only can have
00:07:20.280 a job in campus okay yeah I remember and
00:07:22.120 you're making about like $6 an hour or
00:07:24.360 $7 an hour so that's not efficient um
00:07:28.479 and with 20 5,000 I look through pretty
00:07:30.840 much all of the uh industry and the only
00:07:34.479 one you can make money is trading to
00:07:39.280 um uh using small amount of capital to
00:07:43.319 get over 1,000% or 10,000% return that's
00:07:46.680 where I looked into it and I see a lot
00:07:50.240 of potential into it but I also see a
00:07:52.280 lot of risk so just let need to take a
00:07:54.400 bit I I I was also international student
00:07:58.039 in the state I went to school school in
00:07:59.599 Florida uhhuh so at the time I was I
00:08:03.800 discovered trading around the last year
00:08:06.159 so senior year but I didn't actually
00:08:07.720 trade because I didn't have the money
00:08:09.319 but I was like trying to save up from
00:08:11.280 like my
00:08:12.479 $7 an hour like on campus job but that
00:08:16.080 helped me save us so that brought back
00:08:17.560 some good memories yeah yeah I mean yeah
00:08:21.879 similar similar to boat so you found out
00:08:24.639 about trading stocks mhm did you start
00:08:27.440 with like with day trading right away or
00:08:29.280 did you invest or you know people do
00:08:32.039 like a dividend investing or swing
00:08:33.799 trading or did you just dive into the
00:08:35.880 wild wild west of day trading not oh
00:08:39.479 pretty much straightforward into day
00:08:40.679 trading the first ticket I traded was
00:08:42.559 ETF I think it was okay uvxy I mean it's
00:08:46.080 ETF but uh that's the first trade made
00:08:49.760 $20 but uh good
00:08:52.080 job and uh I mean there's bunch of
00:08:55.200 trading histories that have I think ad
00:08:58.000 that straight pretty pretty much
00:08:59.440 straightforward into day trading and uh
00:09:01.880 the first trade was very lucky I think I
00:09:04.200 made 10,000 in one trade really yeah I
00:09:07.640 think I with
00:09:09.040 $25,000 yeah oh okay I think I had a uh
00:09:14.279 I think a $3,000 position okay so tiger
00:09:18.040 went like 300% then I made 10,000 I
00:09:21.160 think the trading could be that easy so
00:09:23.560 oh okay and and the next few weeks
00:09:27.079 instantly 50% down I mean TR on some
00:09:30.040 stupid tickers and over trading were you
00:09:32.640 following alerts at first or did you
00:09:34.800 actually like try to learn strategies
00:09:37.480 and trade I don't follow alerts and I I
00:09:42.320 uh I I want to learn strategies because
00:09:44.880 I look in this industry a little bit
00:09:47.480 differently because I see well in
00:09:50.440 trading industry if you if you make
00:09:52.560 money somebody else is losing money
00:09:55.320 right so zero some game yeah very simple
00:09:59.200 concept yeah so um that means if you're
00:10:03.200 following alerts a lot of people going
00:10:05.160 into one directions that means the if
00:10:08.839 90% people in the trading industry are
00:10:10.959 losing money yeah 10 10% are making
00:10:13.560 money that
00:10:14.839 means uh majority of the you know you
00:10:17.519 have to go opposite of the what the
00:10:19.200 majority go so I start going the
00:10:21.120 opposite Sid of shorting alerts oh so
00:10:24.399 you start out a contrarian from like
00:10:26.600 very early on when people are like
00:10:28.399 pumping what those alerts you were
00:10:29.760 shorting them I'm shorting them yeah oh
00:10:31.720 you fig that I was super early yeah I
00:10:33.959 mean very beginning of my career I
00:10:35.399 started making like 20% 30% again I mean
00:10:38.760 then you start not that start not work
00:10:41.040 doesn't well you start to not work as
00:10:43.880 well because okay um my size is getting
00:10:47.160 bigger and there's not many people
00:10:48.320 chasing alerts anymore and the stock
00:10:50.079 becomes very liquid so it's hard to get
00:10:52.360 out uh but uh that's where my first I
00:10:56.440 would say 50,000 40,000 oh
00:11:00.399 so you started trading pretty big size
00:11:02.639 almost right away then right cuz you
00:11:04.360 mentioned you were taking $3,000 3,000
00:11:07.560 shares $3,000 worth of positions yeah
00:11:10.639 okay I guess you were trading with a 25
00:11:13.200 $27,000 account to avoid PDT yeah and
00:11:16.600 how often were you trading since you
00:11:18.839 didn't have the Restriction of PDT were
00:11:21.000 you still trading every day not trading
00:11:23.040 every day okay um but when there's a
00:11:26.079 play I'm in there so it's still
00:11:28.320 overtrading
00:11:29.399 but uh I think I was making about four
00:11:33.480 to five trades a week and did you dive
00:11:35.440 into full-time trading or were you still
00:11:38.680 I guess you were you managing the
00:11:40.240 classwork and trading on the site yes
00:11:43.360 yes pretty much TR how did you find the
00:11:45.079 schedule then I mean not I mean look at
00:11:47.200 the phone during class I mean other
00:11:50.000 other than the exam but you know just
00:11:52.399 look at the phone during the class uh
00:11:54.600 using TDM trade and not anything oh okay
00:11:58.120 and how did that work out trading on the
00:11:59.480 phone does not work very very well okay
00:12:03.320 slow and uh first of all it's slow
00:12:07.560 second it's I mean take a while to put
00:12:09.880 in limit orders and limit orders yeah
00:12:13.839 yeah so it's not quick at all it was
00:12:17.560 sometimes you miss I miss couple
00:12:19.440 thousand dollars just just trying to get
00:12:21.320 out at one point and 10 second later you
00:12:23.760 know we're 10% down and this is all your
00:12:26.320 first year of trading or how long did it
00:12:28.920 take for you to eventually become
00:12:31.120 profitable 6 months 6 months yeah 6
00:12:34.199 months mhm that's really really
00:12:36.959 fast uh yes because uh I look at so I
00:12:42.399 think the fastest approach to trading is
00:12:44.120 to look at other people's mistakes
00:12:46.000 because what whatever mistakes they made
00:12:48.120 I might run into it later defitely so I
00:12:51.760 look through Gran's entire trading
00:12:54.959 record yeah and I think was uh on the
00:12:58.560 Tim side of the student they have their
00:13:01.639 record on U on profit I think was a very
00:13:05.000 early
00:13:05.959 stage of trading and I was also looking
00:13:09.279 at uh investor underground and other
00:13:12.160 people you know people on Twitter they
00:13:13.639 talk about their trading and poster
00:13:15.120 profits I I don't typically look at
00:13:17.360 their wins I only look at losses and I
00:13:19.360 want to be able to even though they
00:13:22.399 don't post the entry and exit chart but
00:13:24.639 I want to be able to guess where where
00:13:27.000 they short it is I see where where they
00:13:29.120 got uh where they exited or uh maybe
00:13:32.720 they made a huge M mistake they
00:13:35.120 continued to add and eventually got BL
00:13:37.760 out the position so all those mistakes
00:13:40.519 are very valuable experience for me so
00:13:42.959 that's when I become very uh profitable
00:13:45.959 because I actively avoiding those
00:13:48.839 mistakes yeah you you you're really
00:13:50.880 young but you're also really wise a lot
00:13:53.279 of people who start out trading they
00:13:54.759 want to see like the flashy pnls a big
00:13:57.360 profit but you were looking the opposite
00:13:59.639 you're looking at people's losses and
00:14:01.519 looking at learning from their mistakes
00:14:03.920 yeah um and also I know that there's
00:14:08.079 three base factors first of all is human
00:14:10.800 mistakes that's number one you have to
00:14:12.199 fix okay number two is um patterns come
00:14:15.759 from psychology because if you're making
00:14:17.959 money that means other people are making
00:14:20.120 mistakes and you know how stock it
00:14:24.120 really is it's really emotional driven
00:14:27.519 yeah so psychology is very plays very
00:14:29.839 big part of uh in trading so
00:14:32.480 understanding the people that's going
00:14:35.000 the opposite directions or um I mean
00:14:39.320 they're behind the computer clicking the
00:14:41.000 Button making mistakes so you have to
00:14:42.639 understand their psychology first and
00:14:45.480 third you have to use your statistics
00:14:47.800 Theory to back up the psychology side um
00:14:52.440 then with those three combined then it's
00:14:54.759 instantly profitable so but it take it
00:14:58.440 take a while take a while to get those
00:15:00.800 three thing lined up together how long
00:15:03.120 do that take you 6 months really you you
00:15:06.399 everything clicked just like that in six
00:15:08.600 months yeah oh wow so what kind of
00:15:11.399 Statistics I know you mentioned that
00:15:13.199 earlier in the beginning how what what
00:15:15.839 were you tracking to realize okay I need
00:15:17.880 to focus on this one strategy or these
00:15:20.240 two strategy what kind of specific
00:15:22.759 criterias were you looking at first of
00:15:25.120 all I mean when I went went in there
00:15:27.600 it's it's a
00:15:29.199 there's a lot of stuff to track you
00:15:30.680 can't you most people go in with okay
00:15:33.600 well there's a lot of stuff I have no
00:15:35.199 idea what to track right so you start
00:15:38.560 narrow stuff down let's say we have a
00:15:41.519 ticker that's 20 million market cap 3
00:15:44.240 million
00:15:45.120 float uh very similar action put them
00:15:47.920 together how much they traded uh to see
00:15:51.440 there's any similar actions or similar
00:15:54.839 Behavior or if it's going parabolic or
00:15:57.360 start going M midday or Gap up in the
00:15:59.319 pre market uh so pretty much you want to
00:16:03.000 categorize very similar Market very
00:16:05.120 similar Mark uh uh
00:16:07.480 float um and the gap of
00:16:10.319 percentages uh categorize them into one
00:16:12.759 section try to find the conclusion of if
00:16:16.000 volume changed what happened if flow
00:16:18.240 changed what happened so you you kind of
00:16:21.000 put a fixed criteria on All U pretty
00:16:23.360 much everything and uh there's only one
00:16:26.880 factor that's different I see so you
00:16:29.600 will be able to kind of tell okay next
00:16:31.759 time similar flow similar market cap if
00:16:35.120 the volume is different I'm supposed to
00:16:37.079 do this I see so you need a massive
00:16:40.680 amount of Statistics to
00:16:43.000 find uh I know I have I think at
00:16:46.519 beginning I 25 sections okay with market
00:16:50.399 cap between 0 to 10 million FL between 0
00:16:52.759 to one uh Gap up over 50% or market cap
00:16:57.639 between 0 to to 20 or float between 1 to
00:17:01.680 three see this time is different but
00:17:03.800 with gap up percentage with 50% so you
00:17:06.599 only have the flow difference I see and
00:17:09.760 once you only have the flow difference
00:17:11.919 uh with very similar volume throughout
00:17:13.919 the day so you can kind of see what how
00:17:16.000 much did the spiking percentage changed
00:17:19.079 oh so that's one method of how to figure
00:17:23.280 out what to track okay let me sum up
00:17:25.439 that really quick cuz you just mentioned
00:17:27.319 a lot of things I want to make sure
00:17:28.840 audience understand your method ex the
00:17:31.679 first method you mentioned really
00:17:32.960 clearly so essentially you're trying to
00:17:35.039 find the first method that say you
00:17:37.080 narrow down let's say 10 stocks that you
00:17:40.200 know are low flows they have similar
00:17:42.240 volume and then you look at different
00:17:44.520 categories like the volume pre-market
00:17:46.360 volume you know percentage Spike after
00:17:48.799 open and you look at what they have in
00:17:51.000 common yeah and what's the outlier
00:17:53.600 criteria whether it be super low float
00:17:56.440 or super high volume that cost
00:17:59.159 potentially have caused that one stock
00:18:01.240 to Stand Out Among the most yes oh okay
00:18:04.840 got it okay uh first criteria and second
00:18:08.799 is you second way to be able to track uh
00:18:12.960 statistics is you want to focus on
00:18:16.799 volume specifically because people are
00:18:19.840 behind computers trading the tickers
00:18:21.679 right so every shares they trade means
00:18:24.159 one shares and well of course there's
00:18:26.840 alos and H found involved in there but
00:18:29.960 you have to think there's one thing that
00:18:32.000 the Hedge found that won't do is they
00:18:34.120 take the entire the flow so basically
00:18:37.080 they buy the entire flow okay and first
00:18:40.000 of all they have they have to file to
00:18:41.840 the SEC that's very that's you know not
00:18:45.000 very convenient that's what they what
00:18:46.640 they don't want to do and second you
00:18:50.799 want to if you want to pump the stock
00:18:53.039 you don't want to own the entire flow
00:18:55.039 because eventually once you sell you're
00:18:57.159 basically uh playing with yourself yeah
00:18:59.880 there's no one else to sell to there's
00:19:01.280 nobody else to sell you need the
00:19:02.520 liquidity so you do not want to occupy
00:19:05.720 the entire floor you want to retail to
00:19:07.280 go in there yeah and pump the stock up
00:19:09.760 and they sell into the retails and
00:19:11.000 retails loses money so once you track
00:19:14.520 enough multi- rers there's actually a
00:19:17.760 very uh similar number that how much
00:19:21.440 money can retail put into a ticker okay
00:19:25.320 based on float or market cap based on
00:19:27.559 market cap okay yeah so uh that's
00:19:31.520 another way to track statistics based on
00:19:35.760 how to really short into multi owners so
00:19:38.919 in that case that say hypothetically
00:19:41.120 speaking your second method just
00:19:42.679 mentioned let's say based um I don't
00:19:45.520 know 50 mil market cap retail can only
00:19:49.440 let's say from that tracking retail can
00:19:51.559 only get up to you know 10% of that
00:19:54.440 market cap and then that's the ideal
00:19:56.159 time to short uh yes yes but more more
00:20:01.039 accurately uh do you want to be more
00:20:03.080 accurate is you want to use the volume
00:20:06.159 uh times the average traded price on
00:20:07.960 that day if it meets the threshold of
00:20:11.080 how much money that retail can pour into
00:20:13.000 stock that means stock will go down next
00:20:15.039 day uh because basically the stock has
00:20:17.919 reached the maximum threshold that
00:20:19.720 retail can push up to the maximum
00:20:21.760 maximum percentage yeah yes oh
00:20:24.280 interesting I never thought of that way
00:20:26.000 or dollar amount there there's a lot of
00:20:28.559 uh I can go uh so I I'll do three um
00:20:33.080 there's another way to track statistics
00:20:35.840 mean uh which I personally use which
00:20:38.880 will be volume
00:20:41.400 comparison is that you want to um so
00:20:46.520 there's three different uh uh categories
00:20:50.039 you want to do you want to track first
00:20:51.840 of all
00:20:52.799 is uh to be able to correctly track in
00:20:56.760 resistance okay and lot of people see
00:20:58.960 okay well there's a resistance that
00:21:01.559 traded 50 million volume on a price of
00:21:05.080 three and uh next time I want to short
00:21:08.919 against with that $3 resistance right
00:21:12.240 okay and so let's see for example let's
00:21:16.640 say uh 50 million Vol that means five
00:21:19.120 people let's say five people bought
00:21:20.679 stock at three two mon later stock
00:21:22.720 instantly dumped 90% everybody wants to
00:21:25.400 get out because well if I get out I'll
00:21:27.559 be down % what's the point of me selling
00:21:30.279 right now since I'm already down 90% so
00:21:33.559 the first reaction that when stock
00:21:35.279 pushes back two three right everybody
00:21:38.480 wants to wants to sell okay that's their
00:21:40.480 instant reaction that's human psychology
00:21:42.200 right there so
00:21:45.080 and but here comes a problem because
00:21:48.000 we're dealing with low floats so if the
00:21:50.919 stock only have 3 million float and has
00:21:52.799 50 million volume in there and that
00:21:55.760 doesn't mean that there's 5050 million
00:21:57.640 resistance in there cuz there's only 3
00:21:59.600 milon volume 3 million flow sorry okay
00:22:03.080 from previous let's say uh chart the
00:22:06.240 resistance from like weeks ago yes
00:22:08.360 doesn't have that much volume is what
00:22:10.039 you're saying no doesn't it doesn't have
00:22:11.880 the flow in there doesn't have 1550
00:22:14.240 million flow okay so if you want to
00:22:16.360 let's say one one um every share is a
00:22:19.679 back holder 15 million shares means 15
00:22:22.520 million back holder but if there's a 15
00:22:24.679 million shares only 3 million flow
00:22:26.760 there's only 3 million back coders okay
00:22:29.080 does that make sense that makes sense
00:22:30.320 yeah so uh next time when you try to
00:22:33.919 short into
00:22:35.200 resistance that's the statistics you
00:22:37.200 want to track
00:22:38.880 because you are shorting a 50 million
00:22:41.520 resistance but there's only 3 million
00:22:43.720 backers in there okay so there's a very
00:22:46.520 possible chance that stock can push
00:22:48.159 through that resistance because there's
00:22:49.480 only 3 million flow oh I see so a lot of
00:22:53.279 people trying to just short based on how
00:22:56.279 much volume uh that that's against the
00:22:58.799 15 million that's a very interesting
00:23:01.919 statistics to track
00:23:04.360 and um it you can once you track that
00:23:08.120 statistics you can help you avoid a lot
00:23:11.080 of traps traps see so I think the first
00:23:14.000 two method you mentioned helps you find
00:23:16.520 a potential short entry the third one
00:23:18.919 helps you avoid getting squeezed yes
00:23:21.200 okay yeah oh thank you for sharing that
00:23:24.080 there's uh there's many many many uh uh
00:23:27.279 stuff that I
00:23:28.960 I mean I came up in the last couple
00:23:31.240 years what about you are you tracking
00:23:33.880 any kinds of stats yourself make sure to
00:23:36.159 share with other Traders down
00:23:38.120 below is that do you think that's the
00:23:40.559 reason why you pretty much stick with
00:23:43.919 small caps cuz when it comes to large
00:23:46.279 cap stocks there's a lot a lot less of
00:23:48.720 these in inefficiencies right and a lot
00:23:51.520 of the patterns the stats you track do
00:23:54.559 they apply to other kinds of stocks no
00:23:56.720 they don't uh the limitation
00:24:00.039 is uh well except 2021 but the
00:24:04.080 limitation is you cannot go beyond
00:24:06.039 market cap that's above 300 million
00:24:09.279 initial initial market cap so if the
00:24:11.520 stock starts to spike starting with 300
00:24:13.720 million market cap then doesn't work
00:24:16.279 okay but start less than 300 million
00:24:18.440 let's say started around 100 million
00:24:20.720 then goes all the way to couple billion
00:24:22.720 it works oh so you're talking about
00:24:25.279 let's say the first day of the run where
00:24:27.559 the stock already started from yes oh so
00:24:30.760 anything about 300 mil that doesn't
00:24:32.399 count that still categorize a small cap
00:24:34.440 right yes still categorize but you just
00:24:36.720 won't trade it I just won't trade it oh
00:24:39.360 so how you pick your stocks to trade is
00:24:41.679 by volume and the market cap has to be
00:24:44.159 below 300 mil yes oh okay and what kind
00:24:47.159 of volume are you looking for when you
00:24:49.080 are scanning for stocks to trade each
00:24:50.760 morning uh really depends I mean volume
00:24:54.279 highest the higher the higher the better
00:24:56.799 okay uh I mean I do avoid first Green
00:25:00.840 Day very crowded volume okay avoid that
00:25:03.520 type of tickers uh but once they exhaust
00:25:07.159 their volume then uh higher the volume
00:25:10.159 the better yeah okay what about
00:25:12.279 percentage gapper percentage um is there
00:25:15.440 a point of like too high or like too low
00:25:18.760 if it gaps above 200 I would say oh well
00:25:22.720 it's probably more ridiculous when it's
00:25:25.399 gaps above like 500% then it looks a
00:25:28.600 little bit fishy to me um but the ideal
00:25:32.840 range should be
00:25:34.320 between 100 to
00:25:37.480 150 100 to 170 yeah percent
00:25:41.720 percent oh okay like it has to have
00:25:44.360 gapped up that much for you to be
00:25:45.760 interested in trading them not
00:25:47.480 interested but more comfortable trading
00:25:50.399 okay I Gap up 500% I'm still interested
00:25:52.880 in trading them I'm just want to be a
00:25:55.520 little bit cautious on how to size in
00:25:57.840 okay yeah so I I get that you know 100%
00:26:01.360 gainers are very normal in 2020 and 21
00:26:04.840 but how what about in 2022 and 23 how
00:26:08.480 are you selecting stocks then do you
00:26:11.039 change your criteria there's still
00:26:12.679 gappers that's above um 20 100% okay
00:26:17.760 very few yeah very very uh we have let's
00:26:21.320 see mmv that's one mhm when kep 200%
00:26:27.080 then
00:26:28.440 um yeah not many we had VC IG and all
00:26:33.320 those biotechs that only gapped up like
00:26:35.440 80% so yeah above 100% is my highest
00:26:40.000 winning percentage okay less than
00:26:42.679 70% if it doesn't have a resistance and
00:26:45.240 on first screen day and it's a biotech
00:26:47.640 yeah that's that's a noo for oh so you
00:26:49.960 also don't want to trade try to avoid
00:26:52.480 biotechs yeah yeah okay is there a
00:26:54.600 reason why oh every time when I trade
00:26:56.480 biotch I lose I mean it's and ATT track
00:26:59.000 statistics on I still lose so I've been
00:27:01.919 fighting biotch for many years now and
00:27:04.520 uh it's sometimes you win sometimes you
00:27:06.640 lose but by the end of the day you lose
00:27:08.799 money right and and uh doesn't really
00:27:12.200 matter we are going short we going along
00:27:14.240 yeah biotches are very hard to predict
00:27:16.360 they do not follow small cap stati
00:27:18.760 statistics at all oh interesting so not
00:27:21.159 only do you track those individual
00:27:23.200 stocks or sectors or like the individual
00:27:25.880 stock criteria you also track your own
00:27:27.880 performance trading these stocks yeah I
00:27:30.559 track everything yes okay how much the
00:27:32.480 stock will drop to at what percentage to
00:27:36.159 what scent I can get to that sometimes
00:27:38.600 yeah that's how i' be able to bottom
00:27:40.360 tick and top tick a ticket oh so what's
00:27:42.840 like the a general formula you use to
00:27:45.519 find the the top tick and the bottom
00:27:47.799 tick and there's no general formula it's
00:27:49.640 based on different patterns okay yeah
00:27:51.760 every pattern has its own top tick and
00:27:53.320 bottom tick tick uh point oh okay let's
00:27:56.320 talk about your f favorite pattern do
00:27:58.600 you have one right now uh favorite
00:28:01.679 pattern probably this year it's first
00:28:03.720 red day okay um highest they can drop
00:28:08.279 other than IP other than IPO IPO will be
00:28:10.399 a little bit different uh but not IPO
00:28:13.919 multi owners the percentage that can
00:28:16.440 drop market cap that's initially below
00:28:19.960 100 million flow below 5 million under
00:28:22.159 10 million that work too uh the ne the
00:28:26.440 average fading percentage for first red
00:28:30.039 day is negative 26% average okay second
00:28:34.440 day
00:28:35.320 15% and the
00:28:37.640 time typically drops to is 10:30 so once
00:28:42.279 you once reaches okay 10:30 a.m. that's
00:28:46.279 typically the lowest point oh after the
00:28:48.640 first red day so typically you want to
00:28:50.799 hold it overnight with a gap down next
00:28:52.840 day hold on until 10:30 then you cover
00:28:54.480 it yeah okay so these are ways that's
00:28:58.600 like for this particular pattern the
00:29:00.840 first red day that's how you find your
00:29:02.279 exit yeah how do you find your entry now
00:29:05.360 entry is the method that I talked about
00:29:08.200 uh maximum volume on retail or maximum
00:29:11.840 dollar being traded on the retails oh I
00:29:14.120 see do is that your favorite pattern
00:29:16.600 this year has that how how is that one
00:29:18.760 pattern been performing for you this
00:29:20.399 year it's still perform great it just
00:29:24.000 the statistics keeps changing there's
00:29:26.960 the
00:29:27.919 that's flowing in the retail Market
00:29:29.320 keeps changing yeah uh in
00:29:32.600 2021 was 1 billion Inay mhm in I think
00:29:37.039 like htz was something like that Herz
00:29:39.760 yeah yeah I mean not Herz is a billion
00:29:42.360 dollar cap so it's doesn't count that
00:29:44.600 doesn't count but for lower cap the it's
00:29:47.480 1 billion okay and for 2023 it's only
00:29:51.080 200 million so we can see that how much
00:29:53.039 you dropped w a huge drop so we just
00:29:55.600 talk about your favorite pattern what's
00:29:57.720 your your biggest win ever on that
00:30:00.399 specific pattern and your biggest loss
00:30:02.679 we can cover
00:30:04.320 that the first red day or I guess what
00:30:08.559 the most memorable winner and the most
00:30:11.080 memorable loser that You' ever
00:30:13.559 had winner it's dwac dwac
00:30:19.480 m um everybody know that I made 6
00:30:22.760 million on the on the first day I made
00:30:24.679 three 3.5 million on the following day
00:30:26.960 and that 9 3 million on the following
00:30:28.760 day after the 3.5 million so that week
00:30:31.840 total I made 17 million I think oh my
00:30:34.159 God uh or from shorting that stock right
00:30:37.559 or from shorting DW and there's another
00:30:39.519 ticket I followed with it I forgot
00:30:40.960 what's the name it was a sympathy play
00:30:43.399 okay I went from I think went
00:30:45.720 from uh 40 no it was around 52 I showed
00:30:50.159 it around 48 covered at 28 so it's it
00:30:53.519 was a sympathy play of dwac okay uh uh
00:30:58.440 the most memorable loss yes I do
00:31:00.960 remember one it was a biotech uh oh okay
00:31:04.240 1 minut Flo 13 million
00:31:06.200 flow uh I think it didm the uh maximum
00:31:11.760 retail number okay and uh you squeezed
00:31:15.440 above it typically I size in pretty big
00:31:17.600 once it once uh it meets the retail
00:31:19.679 number I see because that's high winning
00:31:21.519 percentage Yeah that's when the com
00:31:24.200 losses and the liquidity was not very
00:31:25.799 great so so so and it took a long time
00:31:29.320 to exit that's why okay I think the
00:31:31.399 highest was a million dollar loss yeah 1
00:31:33.720 million okay now that's why you kind of
00:31:36.480 crossed out biotech from your trading
00:31:38.639 list forever Blacklist now yeah yeah
00:31:41.080 Black List oh okay I mean up to dat has
00:31:43.279 still I don't know because biotechs like
00:31:46.639 they have they they do Gap very often
00:31:49.240 they Gap 100% 200% sometimes and when
00:31:53.639 when there is no play going on like you
00:31:56.039 know in the last couple months and
00:31:58.000 everybody has attempt to trade that and
00:32:00.200 everybody tempting yeah everybody's
00:32:02.240 getting squeezed so um um to be a very
00:32:07.519 consistent profitable Trader yeah to be
00:32:10.399 to stay alive in this industry you have
00:32:13.480 to be super disciplined so yeah yeah I
00:32:16.559 noticed that you don't trade every day
00:32:18.639 like most Traders do how how often do
00:32:21.039 you actually Place trades in a given
00:32:23.240 month uh 3 to five or 3 to a week oh no
00:32:28.639 not three to five in in the recent
00:32:31.519 months three three trades to four trades
00:32:35.480 a month okay yeah typically one trade a
00:32:38.559 week oh wow sometimes not even a trade
00:32:41.200 yeah do you believe in well do you
00:32:44.399 practice what um is also a term that we
00:32:47.320 recently learned from uh lens Bret Brin
00:32:50.760 sorry keep on uh mispronouncing his name
00:32:53.960 he's mentioned this term called
00:32:55.559 exponential bet sizing
00:32:57.840 basically do you size the same across
00:33:00.639 all your different patterns or do you
00:33:02.440 have certain ones like your favorite one
00:33:04.080 that you would use more risk on oh yeah
00:33:06.720 that's compound compound growth is um so
00:33:11.279 uh I have all the patterns winning
00:33:14.039 percentage down mhm some patterns has
00:33:16.480 70% some some some patterns has 80% 90%
00:33:21.320 the higher the winning percentage is
00:33:22.639 that means bigger size for me okay and
00:33:25.039 how do you allocate that let's say
00:33:27.679 the basic average is that's just use for
00:33:31.039 a simple simple number a thousand so
00:33:33.799 then that's say that's the average right
00:33:35.679 let's say anything with 60% win rate you
00:33:38.399 use an average of $1,000 risk and how
00:33:41.559 would you use that for your um 90% win
00:33:44.559 rate or your 80% win rate um patterns
00:33:48.279 like what what number would it be 10x
00:33:50.440 10x oh okay yeah so if so average I'm
00:33:54.399 using 100K 200k positions then and yeah
00:33:57.799 the best it would be 2 million highest
00:34:01.120 that size was 17 million was crazy 17
00:34:03.799 million shares traded not a$ 17 million
00:34:07.120 position oh okay and how do you scale in
00:34:09.918 because I understand once you're
00:34:11.079 starting take taking these like massive
00:34:13.280 sizes how do you scale into your
00:34:17.040 position uh how do you scale in Parts by
00:34:20.119 parts and has to be under 1% of the
00:34:23.960 volume yeah yeah okay so let's say for
00:34:26.960 example for a stock your max size will
00:34:28.960 be let's say in this example 100,000
00:34:32.079 shares and you just divide it up into
00:34:34.119 10,000 share Lots or maybe 20,000 share
00:34:36.918 Lots 50 50 yeah the bigger the positions
00:34:40.639 maybe you have to break down a little
00:34:42.320 bit more but yeah under $1 million it
00:34:45.119 should be two okay two entries oh okay
00:34:48.879 maybe three yeah do you think new
00:34:51.040 Traders should learn about scaling as
00:34:53.159 well or they should do one entry one
00:34:55.320 exit one entry one exit oh it's the most
00:34:58.280 efficient is one one enter and one exit
00:35:01.760 one go oh okay so you never started with
00:35:04.680 like you know let's say divide it into
00:35:07.040 two halves and then just add and add and
00:35:09.280 then two
00:35:10.640 exits uh sometimes you will turn into
00:35:14.320 add and add and add and blow
00:35:17.520 up oh okay yeah but it happens a lot to
00:35:21.520 a lot to Traders oh yeah well basically
00:35:24.480 in that case they're not adding to
00:35:25.800 Winners they're adding aaging down to a
00:35:27.680 loser yeah a lot of people think
00:35:29.880 that uh add into
00:35:32.960 winners carut losses into
00:35:36.240 losers I disagree with that you have to
00:35:40.280 know exactly where you enter exactly
00:35:43.920 where you want to exit and before you
00:35:46.880 enter the trade you should know that how
00:35:49.200 much you will will lose if you fail so
00:35:53.520 we mentioned that about your most
00:35:55.640 memorable loss so when you take these
00:35:57.960 big losses is it usually from slippage
00:36:01.480 or or was everything calculated
00:36:04.280 beforehand everything calculated really
00:36:06.280 okay I already know that million loss
00:36:08.119 was coming oh okay because it's a
00:36:11.079 biotech and you were sizing in that is
00:36:13.560 your A+ setup yeah so you willing to
00:36:16.240 risk a bit more yeah okay I see you just
00:36:19.240 shared some really good tips for a lot
00:36:21.839 of the new be Traders basically you
00:36:24.160 recommend one entry in one exit out yeah
00:36:27.480 yeah don't over complicate this uh maybe
00:36:31.000 two maximum two but I recommend one in
00:36:34.400 and one exit oh okay and we also talked
00:36:38.079 about statistics and tracking do you
00:36:40.520 think beginners should be tracking like
00:36:42.920 you are or they should simplify things
00:36:45.040 or how how would you recommend them to
00:36:46.599 approach tracking well first of all for
00:36:48.880 people that come to trading you love
00:36:50.560 trading I love trading I love to win
00:36:53.760 yeah people some people come in for
00:36:56.280 trading that they want to make money so
00:36:58.680 either way you want uh you want to win
00:37:01.960 so you whatever do whatever that makes
00:37:05.440 you want to win I can guarantee you that
00:37:07.760 tracking statistics will make you win
00:37:09.920 more so okay uh I recommend track as
00:37:14.400 much as you can uh do the method that I
00:37:17.920 recommend the first method which finding
00:37:20.480 out the outliers okay um and to see
00:37:24.800 what's the uh Factor that actually
00:37:27.880 affect the stock push uh fading
00:37:29.800 percentages or pushing
00:37:31.520 percentages um then you will start
00:37:34.319 finding your entry from there so I think
00:37:37.119 a lot of beginners also suffer from
00:37:39.839 struggle with overtrading
00:37:42.040 and how do you think they should is
00:37:44.800 there any way in which they can utilize
00:37:46.960 tracking statistics and help them avoid
00:37:49.880 you know overtrading these like random
00:37:51.720 setups yes there there's one way I found
00:37:54.200 out I was very helpful and they should
00:37:56.960 be the golden tips uh for
00:38:00.319 not making stupid mistakes on over
00:38:02.760 trading okay well I to be honest I over
00:38:05.839 trade uh I see I even over trade I
00:38:09.400 sometimes you know hate myself over
00:38:11.280 trades because you know nobody wants to
00:38:13.720 make stupid mistakes and wasting money
00:38:15.599 on on you know something that you
00:38:18.680 shouldn't do everybody does I don't
00:38:20.800 think there's as long as you're not an
00:38:24.079 algo everybody make overtrading mistakes
00:38:27.560 so uh first method which will be the
00:38:31.079 most important one is you want to track
00:38:34.440 well first of all find your pattern find
00:38:37.119 out the statistics find out the average
00:38:39.839 winning percentage act find out
00:38:44.560 uh the average um profitable percentages
00:38:49.440 so let's say this pattern average profit
00:38:51.319 you can profit around 15% 20% okay find
00:38:55.000 out the frequency how many times happens
00:38:57.079 a year generate a sheet that using a
00:39:00.839 fixed size so let's say every time when
00:39:03.440 this pattern appears I'm going to size
00:39:05.280 in
00:39:05.960 $5,000 I'm going to make $1,000 on the
00:39:08.760 trade uh this pattern happens 50 50
00:39:12.280 times a year 60 times a year you can
00:39:15.920 generate a number MH uh how much you can
00:39:19.240 make a year that's your expected return
00:39:21.319 that's true expected return okay so
00:39:23.560 every time when you sit in front of the
00:39:24.960 computer in the morning every day look
00:39:26.800 at that number first okay look at it
00:39:28.880 first right this is how much I'm gonna
00:39:30.480 make a year so I'm not gonna make a
00:39:32.319 stupid mistakes here today I see and it
00:39:34.960 works very well oh okay okay let me
00:39:38.920 repeat that one more time so you
00:39:40.319 basically find out for each individuals
00:39:42.960 they should find their own strategy and
00:39:45.200 find the average winning percentage and
00:39:47.760 their average return like you know 20%
00:39:50.440 return whatever and they put in the
00:39:52.960 account size and use that the account
00:39:55.520 exposure and you have to calculate how
00:39:57.599 much potentially they can make in a year
00:40:00.440 after learning about how frequent that
00:40:02.200 pattern happens yes and use that number
00:40:05.000 be it 100,000 or 50,000 use that number
00:40:07.960 as an inspiration to stay disciplined
00:40:10.560 and stick with that strategy
00:40:12.720 yeah that's amazing I never heard of
00:40:15.000 this this method I mean I came up with
00:40:17.040 myself because I was over trading yeah
00:40:19.160 oh and that did help you focus on like
00:40:21.240 your A+ strategy yeah always focus on
00:40:23.440 long-term once you look at a number it
00:40:25.079 make automatically trans transition your
00:40:26.880 mind from shortterm to longterm I think
00:40:28.640 what a lot of people do is like they
00:40:29.839 scalp around when there's no like
00:40:32.079 perfect strategy they scalp around to
00:40:33.920 make a $50 here and there and they
00:40:35.920 forget about the big picture here I I'll
00:40:38.000 share a story um so overtrading
00:40:41.560 uh in the first two years I was making
00:40:44.280 900,000 a year and I think the second
00:40:46.480 year was 2.7
00:40:48.560 million and every time every year I'll
00:40:51.920 go into my uh account statement and look
00:40:54.720 at what I traded what what I'm supposed
00:40:57.440 to trade what I'm not supposed to trade
00:41:00.440 okay now there's some losses that I'm
00:41:02.520 supposed to lose that's okay yeah but
00:41:04.880 you you have to recognize what you are
00:41:06.960 supposed to lose what you are not
00:41:08.520 supposed to lose so once I filtered what
00:41:12.440 I'm not supposed to do is I can make 4X
00:41:14.800 of the money that I made oh wow that
00:41:16.839 year
00:41:18.520 so basically that's where I started to
00:41:22.960 do the method that I yeah wow and like
00:41:25.839 especially and it's 4X it's not even
00:41:28.119 something equivalent like one to one
00:41:29.880 it's one to four yeah and also I see it
00:41:33.119 as a challenge because um so basically I
00:41:36.640 the method I use for all the patterns
00:41:38.560 they will generate a number let's say
00:41:39.800 are you supposed to make 20 million this
00:41:42.040 year yeah every time I can only hit
00:41:45.880 30% High highest I hit was 37 okay not
00:41:49.880 even close to 80% to 90% to the
00:41:53.680 full maximum performance that supposed
00:41:56.839 to do as the perfect robot so yeah so is
00:42:00.760 that what you're trying to aim for
00:42:01.960 you're trying to reach a closer to
00:42:05.200 closer to that 100% potential yes and
00:42:08.839 every time I see 30% 30 37% I I keep I
00:42:12.880 have a really close friend I talk about
00:42:14.319 trading but I keep calling myself
00:42:15.920 garbage Trader because I can only hit 30
00:42:18.640 30 37% yeah in a way you kind of treat
00:42:21.200 trading as a game as well oh yeah yeah
00:42:23.319 yeah it's a game now that you made so
00:42:24.920 much money does the meaning of do you
00:42:27.920 think money loses its
00:42:30.119 meaning doesn't lose lose its
00:42:33.079 meaning it uh I don't ever focus on how
00:42:37.880 much money that was generated by trading
00:42:41.200 okay now it is I'll say not the priority
00:42:45.520 it is the first first will be the the
00:42:48.000 thing that I told you is I want
00:42:49.920 to perfect the system yeah um I want to
00:42:54.960 be able to ttic bot and tick okay make
00:42:57.960 sure it hits the maximum performance of
00:43:00.160 all the patterns that I track and if I
00:43:03.280 reach that goal I had I had myself a
00:43:06.319 goal for for myself once I reach 85% I'm
00:43:09.520 quitting trading really yeah so so so
00:43:13.040 but it was never
00:43:15.000 85% but I think you might eventually get
00:43:17.359 there I don't think so really I don't
00:43:19.640 think so last year you did 30% this year
00:43:21.880 you say you're doing 37 no the highest
00:43:23.920 highest was 37 in 2021
00:43:26.680 oh okay so in a way if if you never get
00:43:29.559 to 80% you never quit trading as well no
00:43:33.640 no okay I don't think I'll ever ever get
00:43:36.440 there I mean last year was
00:43:39.400 uh that this year was only 20% even
00:43:42.720 worse last year was last year was sick
00:43:45.760 it doesn't count yeah 2022 was like 29
00:43:49.800 so it's is that kind of what keeps you
00:43:52.000 going as well waking up in the morning
00:43:54.119 each day cuz you're you're here on the
00:43:55.599 West Coast
00:43:56.640 right what time do you wake up 5:30 okay
00:43:59.960 5 to 5:30 uhhuh and then you like scam
00:44:02.800 for stocks and what what's your routine
00:44:05.000 like after you wake up 5:30 what's your
00:44:07.319 routine uh look at that stocks if
00:44:09.640 there's nothing play some video games
00:44:12.400 okay it's I don't want to look stay
00:44:14.640 there and stare at the stocks and you
00:44:16.240 know thinking about some overtrading
00:44:17.559 strategy so yeah um yeah if it fits the
00:44:20.400 criteria fits the criteria if it doesn't
00:44:21.960 you know have some fun play some video
00:44:24.000 games do you ever revisit and look at
00:44:26.599 the scanner midday and see if there's
00:44:28.520 opportunities or like if you don't see
00:44:30.599 anything by 6:30 that's it for the day
00:44:32.599 uh no trade after 1200 that's okay no
00:44:34.960 trade after 11: suppose and that's 11:00
00:44:38.200 a.m. uh West Coast time or 11:00 a.m.
00:44:42.280 Market time Market time Market time okay
00:44:45.599 1130 a.m. oh okay what do you do for fun
00:44:49.800 Sten do you look at spreadsheets and
00:44:52.319 math and numbers for fun on your
00:44:54.079 downtime oh I play a lot of video games
00:44:56.559 oh okay yeah um I played Starcraft 2 uh
00:45:00.800 for many years okay and before I I was
00:45:05.079 mainly focused in trading I got into a
00:45:09.040 uh World Series
00:45:11.440 Championship oh you tra trading uh not
00:45:13.920 trading Pro playing pro not playing pro
00:45:16.800 but but uh my skill is approaching to
00:45:19.760 Pro oh okay yeah I got to highest I got
00:45:22.240 to was round of 64 World Series
00:45:24.720 Championship yeah but how come you
00:45:26.280 didn't pursue it I didn't cuz trading
00:45:28.319 makes more money that that's true well a
00:45:31.520 lot of pro players they G Pro Gamers
00:45:34.520 they make a lot of money too but you
00:45:36.680 know like they get paid at like 50 mil
00:45:38.720 like the ones who win yes well I mean
00:45:41.720 most of it U it's not the price they uh
00:45:45.040 they promote either they they Market
00:45:47.640 they're the marketer of their game so oh
00:45:50.119 they get paid that way oh okay I mean
00:45:53.160 that that game gives me a lot of
00:45:54.520 benefits uh first of all is psychology
00:45:57.440 second is hand speed oh clicking buttons
00:46:00.480 clicking buttons I will be able to
00:46:01.880 borrow like shares within point for 30
00:46:05.400 seconds you can have hot Keys set for
00:46:07.280 that too I know but like you back in the
00:46:09.920 days manually yes I can do very quickly
00:46:12.920 okay yeah so Starcraft got you to think
00:46:15.440 about to to train I guess your mouse
00:46:18.520 click speed yeah and and you mentioned
00:46:21.480 something about trader psychology with
00:46:23.599 is buyers or seller how how does that
00:46:25.920 game help you start thinking about it
00:46:28.440 that way the game itself is very
00:46:31.000 competitive it's one one versus one so I
00:46:33.920 have an opponent that's on the opposite
00:46:36.440 on the opposite of my side yeah and
00:46:39.359 first of all you have to scout have to
00:46:41.680 guess his strategy and according to his
00:46:44.480 plan you have to make defense defense
00:46:46.839 plan if his plan changes and you got it
00:46:49.160 around then you lose so it's basically a
00:46:53.040 counter psychology game back and forth
00:46:55.079 back and forth until you win yeah so and
00:47:00.280 and also uh it cor it what you are
00:47:04.319 thinking with your hand you don't
00:47:06.400 misclick you don't do anything uh you
00:47:08.559 know if you make a mistake mistake on
00:47:10.520 misclicking you lose the game too yeah
00:47:12.920 so um and it's always high focus during
00:47:18.440 the high focus moment you have you have
00:47:20.160 to also think about the counter strategy
00:47:22.000 for from for other people and um I think
00:47:25.200 it's very simil to trading very intense
00:47:27.720 moments and also be able to think
00:47:29.839 clearly be calm figure out you know you
00:47:33.040 don't first of all you don't misclick so
00:47:34.680 can figure out what they're thinking to
00:47:36.440 to be able to build a counter strategy
00:47:37.880 against them so so you kind of have to
00:47:40.040 think about their potential couple steps
00:47:42.520 after and think about if he does that
00:47:44.880 then what are you going to do yes the
00:47:46.760 the I forgot who told me this but
00:47:49.040 trading is basically a bunch of if and
00:47:51.800 then statements like if stock ABC does
00:47:54.920 this then this should happen yeah is
00:47:57.319 that kind of how you kind of start
00:47:59.000 thinking about trading uh yes yeah I
00:48:02.680 know you used to live in Ohio is there a
00:48:04.480 reason you decide to move to California
00:48:06.520 to pay more taxes not pay more taxes but
00:48:09.480 uh there's better food here that's for
00:48:12.319 sure yeah um a love food uh I don't like
00:48:16.280 waking up earlier but um better weather
00:48:20.200 I I don't like cold weather I think I
00:48:21.800 told you I hate cold weathers um and uh
00:48:26.559 yeah that's pretty much it that's pretty
00:48:27.680 much it and we have a different life
00:48:30.079 experience I don't I'm not planning to
00:48:32.640 live in California forever okay so oh
00:48:36.480 were were some of your family out here
00:48:38.640 as well no no just you I have a brother
00:48:41.720 uh when when it's currently going to
00:48:44.200 school in uh used to go to school in
00:48:46.160 Florida now in Connecticut oh okay older
00:48:49.640 or younger brother younger 10 years
00:48:51.680 younger oh okay yeah so you're the
00:48:54.200 eldest of the family do do you think he
00:48:56.440 look up to you as an example oh yes he
00:48:58.799 does yeah yeah would you want him to get
00:49:01.359 into trading no I asked people that a
00:49:04.319 lot a lot of people uh I
00:49:07.359 mean I believe I to I taught a lot of
00:49:10.799 students I believe you also taught a lot
00:49:12.480 of students trading is not for any
00:49:16.200 everyone I believe that too yeah you
00:49:19.720 have to have that very very good
00:49:23.240 personalities that's number one number
00:49:26.040 two be able
00:49:29.319 to uh handle trading in a different
00:49:33.040 perspective a lot of people go into
00:49:35.480 trading with the gambling mindset yeah
00:49:39.160 yeah I mean every time you gamble every
00:49:41.839 time you lose it's that's the rule yeah
00:49:45.040 speaking of
00:49:46.440 gambling you're Chinese were both
00:49:50.760 Asian stocks like trading stocks or
00:49:53.400 investing in stocks or even research
00:49:55.520 searching stocks in Asia there's like a
00:49:58.079 negative
00:49:59.240 stigma was was your family ever
00:50:01.640 concerned about what you're doing back
00:50:03.480 then and you my dad was my mom wasn't
00:50:06.760 okay um because whatever they
00:50:10.480 experienced early in their age they
00:50:12.599 don't want their child to go through the
00:50:13.960 same thing they also suine stocks uh do
00:50:17.559 they yeah stocks is something that they
00:50:20.280 don't want their child to go through
00:50:21.720 because they took a lot massive loss in
00:50:24.240 their earlier age
00:50:26.480 so um that's how parents teach their
00:50:30.640 student oh teach their child to you know
00:50:34.520 go through their life I mean not just
00:50:36.559 stocks if they uh you know made some
00:50:39.359 mistakes in any other industry they
00:50:41.319 wouldn't want their child to go through
00:50:42.760 that yeah same again do you think
00:50:44.680 they're proud of what you've
00:50:48.359 accomplished uh
00:50:51.400 yes yes and no no it's
00:50:56.000 I did not beat my own
00:50:58.160 game yes is uh um of uh I mean have made
00:51:06.040 some histories trading as a retail
00:51:08.359 Traders MH uh highest profitable oh
00:51:12.559 highest p in one day I guess yeah uh
00:51:17.520 probably throughout the year too uh but
00:51:20.119 uh yeah do you think
00:51:22.520 if I know you're doing this for the game
00:51:25.000 now if if I say I I tell you today or
00:51:28.240 starting tomorrow you trade you can
00:51:30.040 trade you see all those number but those
00:51:31.720 numbers are not real money meaning you
00:51:34.599 will make zero dollars whether you're up
00:51:36.839 a million or down a million from Trading
00:51:39.160 would you still be trading I I wouldn't
00:51:41.040 payer trade okay to be honest because
00:51:44.000 first of
00:51:44.920 all uh I hate people calling me paper
00:51:48.480 Traders at the very begin beginning of
00:51:50.839 my trading career I was posting pinl on
00:51:53.200 on twitters and everybody calling oh
00:51:54.920 paper trading paper trading oh I hated
00:51:57.119 that and uh then I started posting my
00:52:00.000 account statement here's my account
00:52:01.160 statement you can go ask D or you can
00:52:03.079 ask the owner of The Brokerage and uh
00:52:06.480 and I mean they can verify if it's real
00:52:08.480 or not so then that's I mean I I I don't
00:52:11.680 like people calling me like oh you're
00:52:13.440 trading fake money so it's yeah but I I
00:52:15.920 was asking cuz you treat trading as a
00:52:18.240 game and you're just trying to get
00:52:19.559 become a better Trader if you cannot
00:52:21.920 make actual money from Trading would you
00:52:24.319 still wake up every day at 5:30 to scam
00:52:26.280 for stocks to go through that routine of
00:52:28.799 tracking executing your A+ strategies
00:52:31.559 would you still be doing this game I
00:52:33.079 mean I will probably do a very similar
00:52:35.119 game that makes
00:52:36.599 money okay so making money is still
00:52:39.200 important I mean it's important double
00:52:40.960 win yeah um where do you what do you buy
00:52:43.640 with your money what do you place your
00:52:45.520 all the profits what do you do to
00:52:48.720 diversify diversify uh most recently uh
00:52:52.440 you can buy t- bills I mean very very
00:52:55.240 save 5% yeah um and I trade stocks and I
00:53:02.240 don't I don't I mean I don't like
00:53:05.520 long-term stocks I don't know why you
00:53:07.040 don't oh because um I mean the most
00:53:12.000 recent statistics on overall economy
00:53:15.520 doesn't seem very good okay looks like
00:53:18.000 there's a massive recession coming yeah
00:53:20.680 and uh we have all kinds of bubbles um
00:53:24.280 so everything's a bubble now yep and
00:53:28.240 there's going to be a large pullback so
00:53:30.640 cash is Keen right now and okay wait
00:53:33.040 until the market drops and potentially
00:53:35.640 buy some diff okay you so you don't
00:53:37.960 believe in real estate like watches like
00:53:41.319 any alternative
00:53:44.040 Investments uh real estate goes as same
00:53:49.280 as stocks long term oh okay I'm
00:53:52.559 surprised cuz Chinese people usually
00:53:54.559 like to buy real I mean yes yes I do
00:53:56.520 like real estate but they don't perform
00:53:59.119 as aggressive as okay as uh
00:54:02.359 trading so whatever you have available
00:54:05.720 typically for for a method of trading is
00:54:08.000 when I see a good play I wire money in
00:54:10.040 and I trade and wire it out okay so this
00:54:13.319 way you make sure that if you make a
00:54:15.040 stupid mistake you don't blow up your
00:54:16.599 account that's very smart actually and
00:54:20.000 uh as long as you trust your trading
00:54:21.760 skills I would prefer cash oh okay yeah
00:54:25.240 your approach is very similar we we just
00:54:27.240 talked to Tim Sykes the other day he has
00:54:29.559 all his cash according to him in like a
00:54:32.079 money market he doesn't do any
00:54:34.200 Investments no cars no nothing yeah do
00:54:38.359 you invest in cars H yeah I have a few
00:54:41.160 cars but okay they're not investing
00:54:43.799 thing oh okay they literally just buy
00:54:46.160 them because for fun what are your
00:54:48.960 current life goals cuz you're so young
00:54:51.359 you're like 28 27 28 and you achieve so
00:54:54.559 much what's next for you for Steven
00:54:56.880 Ducks next
00:54:58.920 is probably hedge fund yeah okay um and
00:55:04.839 I saw a number that I could potentially
00:55:07.240 make and in
00:55:09.079 2021 and I think I can get there once
00:55:12.240 the market is back of course um it's 200
00:55:15.640 million so my goal is 200 million a year
00:55:17.880 as a retail Trader or as a hedge fund
00:55:20.079 Trader retail okay hedge fund maybe a
00:55:22.559 little bit different yeah I think hedge
00:55:24.480 fund or the depends on how much money
00:55:25.920 you have under assets under management
00:55:29.160 but uh yes okay yeah but do you think
00:55:32.400 once you start a hedge fund or if you do
00:55:35.400 do you have to trade
00:55:37.799 differently maybe I don't know never
00:55:40.520 never start the hedge funds so we'll see
00:55:42.799 okay that'll be very interesting yeah
00:55:45.680 yeah uh probably start small I don't
00:55:48.960 know hedge fund is a little bit
00:55:50.200 different because you don't take you
00:55:53.319 don't take away all all the money that
00:55:55.599 you make mhm it's Investor's money it's
00:55:57.720 Investor's money so you are charging
00:56:00.319 little bit of commissions and very small
00:56:03.520 percentage of how much money that was
00:56:05.440 made maybe it was not very maybe it's
00:56:08.359 not worth it but it could be a good life
00:56:10.280 experience so you try that out you're

# https://www.youtube.com/watch/zig4Q1U6ko4

00:00:00.000 No text
00:00:00.000 you've essentially taken $27,000 and made north of $50 million from the markets is that true yes and you learned
00:00:06.960 to trade within 6 months yes what would you say is the number one skill or trait
00:00:12.639 that has allowed you to make such returns from the markets um meet Steven Ducks an 8 figureure
00:00:19.920 verified trader that turned a few thousand into millions he holds the record for the highest P&L in a single
00:00:26.000 trading day in 2022 over $6 million in 2021 I did a really good month i think
00:00:32.558 in that month I made $20 million in one month when you had that huge month what were you feeling at that time i was
00:00:38.239 feeling on top of the world about 2 20 seconds at that time too
00:00:43.600 yeah but yeah anyways people look at me as the the best trader
00:00:49.840 out there i taught many students 90% of them becomes gamblers they make one huge
00:00:55.120 trade and they think they can make it again it's actually making a huge gain in one trade is not very good for
00:01:01.280 beginner traders because they don't know how to handle that emotions then it turns into a gambling habits and they
00:01:06.880 just got addicted to it what do you say to to those traders that when you see that happening
00:01:13.200 let me explain one strategy uh so it's based on human nature originally the strategy comes from human nature so let
00:01:19.280 me give you example let's say you bought a stock at $10 do you believe that if traders followed
00:01:26.320 say you know the blueprint of everything that you've done that they could achieve the same results or do you believe that
00:01:32.159 there's only a very few and finite amount of traders in the retail world and and from the independent traders who
00:01:37.439 can hit that 8 figure return level um [Music]

00:02:40.800 make this possible we're actually here in sunny California very beautiful place
00:02:46.000 and we've come here for one person only he learned to trade within six months
00:02:52.879 and has taken $27,000 to multi8 figures
00:03:00.720 and today we are joined by the one and only Steven Ducks hello guys
00:03:06.640 thank you for being here with us today oh thank you and I really appreciate uh you know coming on to the podcast it was
00:03:12.480 a huge pleasure to be able to be here and you know to be able to see California as well as part of this trip
00:03:18.400 yeah so I really do appreciate it but Stephen I want to get straight into it you are considered probably one of the
00:03:24.159 best traders of our time especially when we're talking independent and retail
00:03:29.360 traders the results are exponential and I've heard that you've essentially taken
00:03:34.720 $27,000 and made north of $50 million from the markets is that true yes
00:03:42.159 and you learned to trade within six months yes it's It blows me away what would you say
00:03:48.640 is the number one skill or trait that has allowed you to make such returns from the markets
00:03:54.959 um it's been growing I would say at the very beginning um not as fast as I
00:04:02.560 thought it would but once I get to I would say in the in terms of equity of
00:04:08.080 $2 million plus then that's where uh the growth has been um sped up um so the the
00:04:14.799 momentum of it the momentum of it yes would you say there was a particular uh skill set that you had to acquire to be
00:04:21.040 able to do those sort of returns uh there's a lot of things that needs to be
00:04:26.639 acquired as a trader to I would say essential to not really give up in the
00:04:32.720 middle of it so first of all is the persistency and make sure that you're in
00:04:38.560 the game for for a long run not seeing the inst in uh sorry instant
00:04:43.680 gratifications for how much money are making one day so uh I see a lot of
00:04:49.840 traders that posting that they made they're they made 60% 90% even one day
00:04:56.000 of their accounts but within three months you know they giving it all back yeah
00:05:02.400 giving it all back and potentially blow up their accounts so uh first of all make sure that you have a risk system
00:05:09.039 that provides you enough uh cushion for you to survive in a you know in a long
00:05:14.560 run years to come so I developed one of the systems for me is every time when I
00:05:20.560 made a mistake I size down in the next one so 50% uh of the positions compared
00:05:26.639 to the previous one if I make a mistake again then size down so I keep my size
00:05:32.720 in control so I don't lose sometimes you know 50% of my accounts um and that's
00:05:40.639 one of the thing that's very essential for traders and also make sure to take your profits as well uh whenever you
00:05:48.000 made a huge trade I have to tell myself that I actually took a loss because I
00:05:53.280 withdraw money from that trade so let's say I made a million bucks this trade uh
00:05:59.039 I just withdraw 800K i would tell myself multiple times it's a losing trade
00:06:04.639 because I just took 800K loss uh so I only made 200K and that made me more
00:06:09.919 careful going to the next trade uh because you have to kind of counter human emotion because human nature is
00:06:17.600 very I don't want to say greedy but it is greedy so the more you make uh the
00:06:24.000 more greedy you are so I know that it's one of the big uh disadvantage that trader cannot avoid so
00:06:28.000 No text
00:06:31.120 I just use that method to counter that emotion so do you feel like you you almost hijack that feedback loop yes yes
00:06:38.639 uh there's a lot of stuff that I do pretty much in a very similar way so I
00:06:44.800 make sure that I myself stay in a rational um I would say status to make
00:06:51.600 the decisions and learning how to trade within six months do you think that's something
00:06:57.280 that other traders out there can do or do you think that's something more unique to yourself
00:07:02.400 um I was putting a really uh a very urgent spot because uh my dad
00:07:10.000 and mom had its separations and they were sending tuitions to me so I had no pressures in terms of financial but uh
00:07:18.319 they had these separations so I have some uh pressures of how to pay tuitions
00:07:23.680 and where I'm going to work uh that's where it g me sense of urgency that I
00:07:29.120 started to ner uh probably in average 10 hours a day including the weekends uh and then
00:07:36.319 doesn't really count uh I'm listening to audio books while I'm driving
00:07:41.520 um that's related to trading um and thinking about I would say 10 hours of
00:07:48.720 peer studying and probably rest of the days are thinking all about trading um
00:07:55.360 coming up strategies i would say I did that consistently six months and I did a simulation for myself uh
00:08:03.680 with the average reward per trade and the frequency how many times it happened per
00:08:10.400 year and they I can kind of run um or and the average winning percentage so
00:08:16.400 with those three factors I I was be able to generate a simulated gain for myself
00:08:22.560 and it was pretty obvious so I did by myself in real money it came up I would
00:08:28.800 say 50% of the results performance-wise uh I turned 27,000 into 900,000 so
00:08:37.200 that's the first Yeah and so that was the first first sort of phase of taking that capital yeah um and would you
00:08:44.480 regular pay yourself as well even at that stage every time when I make a trade I take about 80% really 50%
00:08:52.640 depends on What's the reason for that is it for that feedback loop yeah for that loop yes and that's been from early
00:08:58.399 early on yes and where did you sort of come up with that is that something you learned from somewhere or just something
00:09:03.680 you decided to do i just decided to do that because I keep making the same mistakes as a normal trader because I
00:09:08.800 made my big gain then next time I tend to size much bigger than I thought and I
00:09:14.000 just give 50% of my G and it's really sucks but so it was actually kind of
00:09:19.120 helped you to reduce that down by just taking the capital out yes i actually make more when I do that really it's
00:09:26.160 kind of the opposite what most people do as you say like most traders will they'll make that capital then they'll double the size the next trade yeah it's
00:09:33.279 very similar to gambling isn't it yeah exactly exactly and in terms of if you
00:09:39.680 were to go back like well before we get there during that six months as you said you would spend like 10 hours a day like
00:09:45.519 what sort of things were you doing like you mentioned audio books like is there any particular ones that you still remember um that may have been helpful
00:09:53.040 during that time h there's a lot of books I don't even remember very beginning that was 10
00:09:58.720 years ago um trading in the zone mhm there is a momentum trader I believe um
00:10:07.600 and most of it I look at in terms of the books in I try to understand their psych
00:10:13.440 psychology not the method of trading because uh the method has to be generated by
00:10:20.000 statistics a lot of people trading up to now is still um not based on statistics
00:10:27.360 or based on their instinct so uh I want to take a look at their
00:10:34.399 journey of how the mindset was how how did they go through their journey with
00:10:40.959 their psychology and basically when they make a profit what's their reaction and what's their mistakes are focused on so
00:10:48.000 I can generate a method to counter that um to be able to avoiding those mistakes
00:10:54.160 in the long run um one thing that I did is at that time there is
00:11:00.880 uh profit that traders tends to post their trades on profit um yeah was it
00:11:06.720 like a verification platform verification platform but it's not very accurate but right now Kfo is probably better but uh you can I don't look at
00:11:14.320 other people's skin i only look at their losses and I want to go in there find out try to guess their entries and exit
00:11:20.800 and try to think try to replay that day and how their mindset actually was going
00:11:27.040 through different things um and I can make sure that I avoid that um while I'm
00:11:33.200 training so so you try to learn from their losses try and learn and but then also not only learn from their losses or
00:11:38.640 identify them but try and put yourself in their shoes and see you know what sort of mindset it would be would you
00:11:44.399 actually go on the chart as well yes to see these trades yes what was the thought process behind that did you just
00:11:49.600 come with up with that yourself as well and just was that something you thought this would be beneficial more beneficial
00:11:55.360 than say just reading the success stories of traders um I don't know I kind of based I was engineering major so
00:12:03.040 I kind of look at stuff different when you want to make a car work you know you have to test a thousand times of
00:12:09.360 mistakes you always want to focus on the mistakes that rather than what has been working so that's the mindset I have
00:12:16.720 let's take a break for a minute there guys cuz I want to tell you about our incredible sponsor Alpha Prime the first of its kind in the industry now
00:12:23.279 evaluation firms have been in the industry for the last few years and done absolutely phenomenal in terms of its

00:13:38.320 use the code RZ for 20% off all challenges link is in the description
00:13:44.079 below now let's get back to the episode well I I respect it and I can see why though it makes sense and what you can
00:13:49.279 learn from that versus how much would you learn from just looking at someone's winners you would just understand that they've
00:13:55.279 managed to make so much money and yeah maybe strategy based but you'd learn a lot more especially as a trader because
00:14:01.360 as they say losses are lessons right but how many people actually are learning from their losses not many people
00:14:07.040 exactly people are always focused about their gains uh in social media a lot of
00:14:12.160 people talk about I made millions of dollars and um then people feel actually FOMO about
00:14:18.320 it so they will go into you know their own account and make huge
00:14:23.440 trade because they saw somebody make a bigger trade um that's one of actually a
00:14:28.639 trend for the trading yeah the trading community so you mentioned statistics i
00:14:35.360 really was interested in that in terms of what what was your process of sort of finding out the statistics you know what
00:14:41.760 what did you do to find out the statistics for your strategies and what you then utilize to trade
00:14:47.680 so in terms of finding out strategies um
00:14:53.360 okay let me explain one strategy uh so it's based on human nature originally the strategy come comes from human
00:15:00.000 nature so let me give you example let's say you bought a stock at $10 stock drops to $1 next day you feel very
00:15:07.120 frustrated uh after two months stock hasn't moved at all after six months
00:15:13.199 stock gapped up to $7 Your instant reaction is to sell at open
00:15:20.000 there's no way most of the time 99% of the time people want to cut their losses even so I'm in there knowing you going
00:15:28.240 to sell I will place myself in a short positions as soon as you sell cause a huge red panic as other people um having
00:15:36.800 the same reaction then I'll be able to take that 20% in profit and that's the original idea of the strategy then you
00:15:45.440 want to track down uh the market cap which market cap works the best maybe
00:15:51.519 it's 10 million to 100 million maybe it's 100 million to 1 billion uh you want kind of to narrow that down so you
00:15:58.240 want to focus on maybe one 10 to 100 zero to 10 million float those are just
00:16:04.240 the criterias for this re reaction pattern then you want to focus on the
00:16:11.680 volume based volume is how many shares are traded in that day right so
00:16:17.600 if that candle daily candle is red that means most people are selling um then
00:16:24.160 the stock gaps up to your original price the volume has to surpass the intraday
00:16:29.839 volume because there's more people that got stuck in there trying to sell it to you or you're like the person who's
00:16:37.360 stuck in the previous candle wants to cut it even now so uh there's more there's 10 people try to
00:16:44.160 sell two people try to buy so of course stock goes down so you can you can also try to narrow down the volume range
00:16:50.800 let's say 50 million 100 million 200 million which volume works the best which volume has the best reaction so
00:16:58.399 you can kind of uh next time when you trade you know exactly what you uh what
00:17:03.839 you should do um which market cap which volume and which uh price range works
00:17:11.760 the best and uh how much do they generate in terms of reward let's say each each time you place a trade you
00:17:18.559 make about 20 30% i actually I can narrow it down to
00:17:24.400 in terms of a decimal point so let's say for first red day it goes down to
00:17:29.760 negative 26.4% in average so so like those those level of statistics that
00:17:36.400 level of insight you know rather than just as you say 30% you're actually going to the decimal point what's your
00:17:41.679 process of collecting that data are you going through past data and putting
00:17:47.520 these filters on as you mentioned whether it's the float whether it's the market cap whether it's the uh the volume is this what you're doing and
00:17:54.480 then by doing that you're creating the strategy you're creating the edge based off the data you're collecting from the
00:18:00.720 market correct yes so is it a case of just back testing or you live testing as well uh live testing and back testing
00:18:07.200 yeah both how important do you think it is for traders to to go through that process because as you mentioned a lot
00:18:13.280 of traders will not put in the necessary work and a lot of traders aren't using
00:18:18.400 statistics they're using intuition or maybe a lot of the time I would imagine
00:18:23.840 they're just taking information maybe from online you whether it's a mentorship or a YouTube video but
00:18:30.559 they're not doing the actual work necessary to even take that strategy they're just maybe taking a technical
00:18:36.400 pattern only yeah so that's the problem of the of the traders there is few things that you really have to
00:18:40.000 No text
00:18:44.000 know before you get into this industry first of all is as I said that uh
00:18:49.280 strategy comes from psychology human nature so you have to make sure that you
00:18:56.720 understand the fundamental of the strategy not just copying oh okay well there's a higher higher high from the
00:19:02.400 previous day then you buy not from a based indicator it has to based be based on a psychology that people tends to
00:19:10.160 react you kind of have to guess what people are thinking behind the computer because everybody basically clicking
00:19:16.400 their mouth uh making their decisions so making a counter strategy of the
00:19:21.600 majority people of what they're thinking is very important number two back testing is also very important because
00:19:28.160 statistics will give you very accurate how where you should go in and where you
00:19:33.919 should get out um so and also what's the maximum reward you can get uh because
00:19:40.480 people go go in and let's say they bought in at $2 they don't know where they're going to exit they short at $10
00:19:47.679 they don't know where they're going to cover and they might miss the perfect opportunity to cover and the stock
00:19:53.360 bounces back and they miss the opportunity they feel formal and they make a mistake then it goes downhill from there so I've been there many times
00:20:00.640 that's why I have to be very accurate and precise about the entry and exit uh
00:20:06.000 but the most important thing is the strategy has to make sense uh fundamentally um so if it doesn't make
00:20:12.080 sense if it's just a pure technical you buy when when the signal crosses
00:20:17.679 here you buy when the signal crosses here it just doesn't really When you say fundamentally do you mean as in the
00:20:23.200 fundamentals behind the stock itself or do you mean in terms of the the statistics the fundamental and the psychology and on the psychology part
00:20:29.120 yes okay is fundamentals something that you look at or do you primarily look at the the psychology the technicals and
00:20:34.880 the stats um primarily look at the psychology incredible interesting and in
00:20:40.159 terms of if you were to redo your journey for example and you had to learn
00:20:46.480 in that six months again because when you started it was like 10 years ago maybe technology advanced by now to
00:20:52.720 maybe even speed up that process of getting the statistics for example but is there anything you would do differently is there is there a process
00:20:58.480 that you would follow now if you were to start from zero i'll be honest in terms of data
00:21:03.919 collections there's much easier tools to do it um and there's a lot of tools out there
00:21:09.520 that gives you 20 years worth of data um the the biggest problem that I found is
00:21:15.200 especially when you are in this small cap industry a lot of tickers tends to do lots of reverse split lots of reverse
00:21:21.760 split and lots of um dilutions and warrants if they do that it's impossible
00:21:27.039 to find the flow on an accurate date in the past let's say past five years so
00:21:35.840 uh that is the major problem because when you want to narrow down the specific market cap and float and if
00:21:42.159 it's all changed up it did a reverse split 16 times already then it's that's
00:21:48.320 really the big headache so you want to be live tracking it and
00:21:54.880 I personally keep all my data starting 10 years ago manually tracking it live tracking it on that date so I know
00:22:01.679 exactly what the flow is but I still haven't found a a tool yet that gives you accurate flow and market cap going
00:22:10.480 back a stock that did a reverse split maybe their name has changed adjusted for it and and kept the data from the
00:22:17.039 changes and everything yes and price get adjusted too so it's Yeah it's it's a mix makes it much difficult so even
00:22:22.960 though there are tools that can help it's hard to get the accurate data that you you actually need yes and lots of
00:22:30.400 tickers that don't really have the accurate flow at the at the beginning sometimes when we're trading live
00:22:36.000 there's five sources five sources Finn Bloomberg and Dilution Trackers and they
00:22:41.360 have all different flow it's it's horrible one thing I heard you say which
00:22:46.400 was very interesting was that the small cap market in terms of volume I think you said 2020 was like a billion dollars
00:22:56.000 or or more maybe but but then the years after that or a year or two after that it dropped all the way down to I think
00:23:01.120 like 200 million or something yeah is that accurate uh it's I mean it dropped so what I understand is uh my
00:23:08.640 understanding is uh as the Fed keeps printing money there's more money being
00:23:15.200 distributed to the retails uh very obviously we saw in 2021 everybody was g
00:23:22.799 getting the stimulus check and markets going crazy and uh we saw there is uh a
00:23:30.080 significant slowdown in 2020 so not much money being distributed anymore and we
00:23:35.360 we saw the the $1 billion is actually the term that I call dollar block it
00:23:41.440 means uh how much money does the retail have to pile into one ticker and forcing
00:23:48.400 the stock to top because if for the stock to go up another 50% it needs a lot more money so the retail doesn't
00:23:55.440 have that kind of money that's where the retail buying part gets exhausted and stock goes down 50% so um it's I I think
00:24:06.480 it's really related to the market uh the overall spy trend but
00:24:13.120 uh if we have a downtrending year then dollar tends to slow down and we have uptrending here tends to go up so one
00:24:21.039 thing I found fascinating as well that you mentioned is there's like a cap of how much sort of retail money can be uh
00:24:27.360 you know how many shares can be purchased by retail and then that's one of your strategies and edges as well when you correct identify that can we
00:24:34.640 expand on that a bit how do we identify that yeah well how do we identify and then how are you using that to obviously
00:24:40.159 take your trades and execute accordingly okay so it's a general method it's not
00:24:46.000 No text
00:24:46.799 100% precise and accurate Uh for example let's say the initial
00:24:51.919 market cap for very recent RGTI the quantum uh place it was 100 million it
00:24:59.679 went up all the way to $20 and we traded probably around 600 700 million volume
00:25:05.039 um and the stock tends to stock around 18 to 20ish and so as you see that the
00:25:12.159 stock is trending up the market cap grows and you grow into 1 billion two
00:25:17.440 billion and when we hit 18 it's slowing down that means there's more money
00:25:22.559 pouring into the ticker but the ticker is not having a big reaction because we need for a $3 billion to go up another
00:25:29.679 100% we need another three billion so there's one thing that
00:25:36.159 um about a ticker is if you're a hedge fund you do not want to buy all the
00:25:42.799 shares because once you sell there's no liquidity you just end up taking a loss
00:25:48.799 by playing with yourself your goal is to take retail's money that means you cannot take certain percentage of the
00:25:55.679 entire float mhm so hedge funds going to be in there and uh then the rest of it
00:26:02.799 retails so once we hit that specific threshold of retail in terms of uh uh on
00:26:10.559 the range of market caps then stock goes down so so for you then it's quite
00:26:16.400 simple to then start looking as a bias uh for how you can then look to short that stock yes so for certain market cap
00:26:23.360 as a beginning let's say market cap is 10 million you're a hedge fund you cannot take 3 million of the market more
00:26:31.440 than three million because you want to make money and not be able to get stuck with ei liquid stocks so your maximum
00:26:38.880 percentage is 30% you take that 30% rest of it retail and retail have its limit
00:26:44.880 once it hits its uh ceiling then it goes down how do you identify you know when
00:26:50.320 the retail the the hedge funds and what their positions are versus the the retail so you can do this identification
00:26:56.720 or is it more so as you mentioned earlier the psychology you're thinking along these lines how do you identify
00:27:02.400 the hedge fund yeah like when when the retail is reaching its limit so then the that short opportunity starting to
00:27:07.679 present itself is there certain tools that you're identifying these things with or is it as you mentioned earlier
00:27:12.799 about the psychology uh it's about the amount of money being placed into a ticker so let's say the stock goes up
00:27:19.200 10x and um the stock is trading you range of maybe
00:27:26.559 10 to 15 20 or 15 to 20 and it's been stuck in there for a very long time so
00:27:32.320 there's amount of volume use the volume times the price that's how much dollar
00:27:37.520 is being traded there's actually a limit of uh c certain market cap range so 10
00:27:46.799 million to 100 million there's 600 million once it's traded the stock tends to go down it doesn't have to
00:27:52.240 necessarily go down but stock will likely to lose momentum so you place your short positions based on uh once
00:27:59.279 you start to lose its momentum some there's a bunch of exceptions that that didn't go down but it was at least slow
00:28:05.440 down that to a point that it will go down maybe 5 10% in regular cases six 30 40% but there's
00:28:13.440 exceptions that maybe they will go down 5% you won't take a loss but you will
00:28:19.440 keep yourself very safe don't know where the market's going next stop worrying about your trading just get informed on

00:29:37.919 the link is in the description below now let's get back to this episode but again like when these when you've done these
00:29:43.120 scenarios you you've back tested it and you collected the data so you know what the general
00:29:48.880 result will be the general sort of movement will be you also know what as you mentioned like sometimes it will do
00:29:54.000 this like 5 10% and then it might rebound but at least then you by doing so by collecting this data by doing that
00:30:00.320 work you can then react accordingly so it's not really being a shock or or surprise but as you mentioned earlier a
00:30:05.919 lot of traders unfortunately will just place a position and they don't actually have a target in mind they don't actually have a plan thereafter yeah
00:30:12.320 yeah so do you feel like the development of a trader so we talked about using
00:30:19.760 tools now if if someone was going to start today and start to learn they have yes the benefits of being able to
00:30:25.360 collect that statistics and the data from past data uh with obviously the issue of the flow and and the uh ticker
00:30:32.480 names maybe changing but when it comes to your alerts like there's so many
00:30:38.559 different trades available so many different tickers available not all of them will be in play at at the same time
00:30:42.000 No text
00:30:44.559 of course but how are you going about that process is that something you manually do uh and create a watch list
00:30:49.600 and create what you're looking for for maybe the the week or the month or is it something that you have an automated
00:30:55.279 process for um so it's pretty simple you you're
00:31:00.559 talking about how to select the trades uh so basically I only use tickers
00:31:05.600 that's up 20% for the day traded about over 1 million shares in the pre-market
00:31:11.840 the price has to be over $3 $3 or above market cap
00:31:19.039 um should be under 1 billion initially and float has to be less than 100
00:31:26.480 million that's it what is it about those criterias what what's like why why those criterias
00:31:35.440 why have you selected those sort of rules uh because selection because I have tested them and they work the best
00:31:40.960 and they show the best results so and have you still blacklisted biotech
00:31:46.240 stocks or Oh yes still black blacklist uh
00:31:51.600 biotech okay um so I traded biotech for 10 years technic uh trading them based
00:31:58.240 on pattern not about fundamentals um in terms in terms of very heavy technical
00:32:03.679 analysis every single year I spend so much so much time trading biotech by the end of
00:32:09.600 the year I may be positive for 1% so let's say I lose 800K and I made 850K
00:32:17.679 it's not worth my effort every time when you take a loss it affects my psychology affects the next trade it just not worth
00:32:24.000 it um it's uh I telling I was telling many of my students that you know biotech it it's
00:32:30.960 it's the nightmare even though when you win it today you will lose it tomorrow or in the future what do you think it is
00:32:36.559 about them is there anything in particular the characteristics or their actions are very
00:32:43.039 abnormal it's it's not following the regular pattern the multi- demoners
00:32:49.120 especially uh that ticker tends to go from one to 100 they don't really take
00:32:55.120 any pullbacks maybe 10 20% sometimes and there's some weird ones that stuck in
00:33:01.120 there for two months and they just gap another 100% so it's
00:33:07.279 and eventually it come down but it's very irrational people tends to have more will to hold the biotech longer
00:33:15.120 even though their fundamentals are not there so and in terms of positioning
00:33:21.279 wise are you primarily a short trader or do you long as well or is it half and half like what what's your sort of
00:33:26.799 outlook uh I'm 98 99% short really is there any reason for that is that
00:33:33.120 just a preference uh shorting has higher winning percentage especially in the small small caps small
00:33:40.000 caps especially in the small caps um higher reward on single day basis so
00:33:45.840 sometimes you can make up to 70% in one day um going long I mean there's sometimes ticker goes up a thousand% and
00:33:53.039 how am I supposed to catch that so um and uh
00:33:59.840 majority is all about higher winning percentage because going long uh I tried
00:34:05.760 statistics for it statistics for it uh the winning percentage is only about 60% so 60 65 if you do really well maybe 70
00:34:13.918 but there's no way that you can hit 90% 95% so you know how you mentioned that
00:34:19.599 you you're paying yourself off every profitable trade at the start of each year are you starting with the same
00:34:25.040 balance each year or are you compounding slightly as well i compounding slightly as well so
00:34:31.679 um the I think I've reached to the limit of in terms of in terms of day trading
00:34:38.560 wise the most comfortable account equity wise you have for retails I think it's
00:34:46.320 300k then if you want really want to catch all the reward just on single day
00:34:52.320 trading basis not multi-day runner like RTI single day trading basis maybe $2 million equity that's the max you can
00:34:59.680 you and um is that when you start to face liquidity issues yes that I'm facing liquidity issues so the maximum
00:35:06.480 you can sizing on single day one tra single day volume basis is 1.2 million I
00:35:12.960 believe 1.2 1.5 uh for bigger trades that you can size up to like DJT
00:35:20.480 RTI you can sizing up to billions maybe 500 couple hundred million no problem um
00:35:27.599 but in terms of day day trading 2 million uh and uh I have I start right
00:35:33.760 now I start my equity pretty much flat every single year they trading 2 million have another account for multi-day
00:35:39.839 runner that's it uh at the very beginning maybe I keep 50% so let's say
00:35:46.480 you start with 10k then if you don't do really well um and you did maybe 100k
00:35:53.839 then you start with 15 If you do really well going from 30k into 1 million then
00:36:00.720 you keep 200k so it depends on how much you make um so you you'll base it off that and will you also base it off like
00:36:07.280 how the the performance was towards the end of that year for example yes and
00:36:12.560 then well the end of last year if I'm not mistaken you had an incredible end to the last year oh yes I had a crazy
00:36:20.880 last five uh five months yeah it was million-dollar trades back to back it
00:36:27.680 was um started with DJT of course um so
00:36:33.839 what do you do in those in those moments when you're having such a a really hot streak you know really really strong P&L
00:36:39.920 really really strong uh trades and strike rates and and winning trades back toback uh does anything happen
00:36:46.240 psychologically is it something at this point that you're very very numb to it's little I'm I'm a little bit numb
00:36:51.920 too but uh when I have a long win streak I don't really compare to other people
00:36:57.680 of how much I make uh I compared to myself so I have this one calculator
00:37:03.520 uh that supposed to be the perfect trader so what I'm supposed to do what I'm supposed to make and is this loss
00:37:11.200 actually necessary so that sheet that I track is pure based on robotic trading
00:37:17.680 and not emotional trading so I compare myself and end the year or every single
00:37:24.000 month with that sheet okay well I performed 30% of what I supposed to
00:37:27.000 No text
00:37:30.960 supposed to make so I consider to myself you know I still have a lot to improve um
00:37:36.960 and uh it's gotten better but my average performance is about 25 30% compared to
00:37:44.880 the you know she track yeah it's interesting you say that because I
00:37:50.960 can imagine a lot of traders would may may do that exercise with this is what I could make or this is what I should make
00:37:57.119 should I say if I follow the edge correctly flawlessly and instead what they would allow them to do is to create
00:38:03.440 pressure and start chasing that number because they're seeing this this financial number at the end of of this
00:38:09.440 performance year for example and instead of doing what you're doing where you're using it as accountability to try and
00:38:15.280 perform your best yes I can imagine they would allow it to you know almost push
00:38:20.400 them towards oversizing push them to try and achieve it as soon as possible if that makes sense uh yeah but the
00:38:26.160 calculator is based on the maximum size so you can't really push over the size of what I'm supposed to it's not I'm not
00:38:33.359 comparing myself based on the money i'm compared to myself based on how my trading in that uh scenario of
00:38:40.800 executions and sizing because the let's say the volume is 100 million you
00:38:45.920 typically don't size in over 10% of the volume so maximum is 10% of the volume
00:38:51.119 which 1% 1% of the float 10% 10% of the float 1%
00:38:57.760 of the volume and you don't surpass that limit and the size is actually the same
00:39:02.800 so it really com I can really compare it to myself with the executions of um the
00:39:09.200 perfect the perfect execution yeah where did you come up with that concept is this just something you you knew would
00:39:14.320 help you or you wanted to see what the result should be uh no i just want to keep my ego down because in 2021 I did a
00:39:24.320 really good month i think in that month I made of all the counts I made $20 million in
00:39:31.520 one month really and uh my ego was going way over my head it was not very good um
00:39:40.640 and uh because when when you make that much money everybody around you
00:39:46.320 telling that you're the best and you're one of the best i don't really like to
00:39:51.440 hear that really did you hear that i'm sorry no no no no no no no no because because you know people tend to pump you
00:39:58.960 up and your ego gets way too big and then you you make mistakes so
00:40:06.160 uh I and I started make I think I took 800K losses on a stupidest ticker um
00:40:15.440 next month and I took I think another 400k loss uh going to the next month it
00:40:21.920 was just very bad and I just keep telling myself that I have to compare to this to the perfect trader that's the
00:40:28.560 imagin now I say imaginable perfect trader and uh you know tell myself I'm a
00:40:34.079 trash trader so So did you develop it then after that period or did you already have it then i developed it ever
00:40:40.800 after so how how did you handle that period though so what were you feeling or you
00:40:45.920 know when when you had that huge month what were you feeling at that time um
00:40:52.800 I was feeling not on top of the world bought two conisacks at that time you
00:40:57.920 were two yeah but yeah anyways
00:41:03.119 two two that's crazy do you still did you keep the two or you
00:41:08.800 think I kept one kept sense but then when you then hit those losses what was
00:41:15.280 your your mindset like then what were you thinking then when you you're taking these these sizable losses that you probably weren't taking previously it's
00:41:22.640 not about the losses about the money it's more about what I was thinking because I'm not supposed to take this
00:41:28.000 type of loss it's for me it's outside your plan yeah outside of my plan and
00:41:33.200 it's really an amateur move it's more like you're buying uh zero day
00:41:38.960 expiration call options you know it's it's very gambly so every time every every month I
00:41:44.720 tend to go back and look at my trades is this loss actually necessary for me to
00:41:49.920 take am I learning from this loss is it is it actually following the statistics you have to be really disciplined
00:41:56.160 because some losses it does you know there's exceptions that ticker that doesn't really follow the pattern so
00:42:04.160 uh those losses are necessary i'm okay with that but for losses that's made by
00:42:09.920 pure emotional mistakes that's that's not acceptable for me so
00:42:15.040 So the process then obviously you created this perfect trader that you can
00:42:20.160 you can try and hold accountable keep you humble as well keep the ego down
00:42:25.200 but the process of you reviewing your trades then when you identify these mistakes what are you what are you doing
00:42:30.720 what are you writing are you trying to you know what's the selft talk like when you're reviewing the trades each month
00:42:38.480 so I first of all I pick out the biggest gains and biggest losses because some of
00:42:44.480 the gains are made also based on instincts and also maybe a little gimbalish with risk controlled so I want
00:42:52.400 to make sure that which is the trade that I'm supposed to make which is not and how I be able to con consider which
00:42:59.920 one is the trade trade I'm supposed to make is they have to follow a certain pattern
00:43:05.760 for example multi runner did they run three consecutive days with more volume compared to previous day how much dollar
00:43:12.800 B did they reach and where's my entry am I close to the consolidations or am I
00:43:18.000 did I identify there's a certain risk uh did I amplify my risk based on the trend
00:43:24.160 uh was developing throughout the day um and am I trading am I overtrading if the
00:43:32.560 ticker doesn't fit any pattern I'm just randomly buying or shorting something uh that's something that I need to be
00:43:38.880 improved in next month so in terms of that though have you ever identified a
00:43:44.240 trade where it was against your plan but it was actually a winner
00:43:50.000 No text
00:43:50.720 uh went went against my plan by it was actually a winner that I went actually
00:43:56.720 won on that trade or no yeah you won on the trade so when you're reviewing it you realize actually wait this trade
00:44:02.560 here and I need to take it out it's but you take it out of your data yes it it's not the money I'm supposed to make every
00:44:09.200 money uh every penny that I made by luck or went against my plan that I even made
00:44:15.040 money that it's the money I'm going to lose in the future m so is that the way
00:44:20.720 you see it that's the way I see it yeah is that what is necessary do you feel like so like these processes that we've
00:44:27.119 talked about so the collection of data the statistics uh reviewing your trades every month and identifying you on
00:44:34.960 multiple levels did you perform well and even holding yourself accountable and understanding that even if you won money
00:44:42.720 by luck and and not really with your plan that you hold yourself accountable even in those moments is that's how
00:44:49.119 important is that to be able to perform at the level that you do and just be generally a consistently long-term
00:44:54.560 profitable trader it's it's very important because um same psychology as
00:45:00.640 you go into casino you make money that based on luck and you you will always think about that money and you will go
00:45:07.119 back and lose it so it's the same thing in the in the stock market you make money that you shouldn't supposed to be
00:45:12.400 make and you you gota cut it going into the uh next month so uh make sure that
00:45:21.280 always control risk it's uh don't make gamboly traders yeah do you believe that
00:45:28.720 if traders followed say you know the blueprint of everything that you've done that they could achieve the same results
00:45:35.200 or do you believe that there's only a very few and finite
00:45:41.119 amount of traders who can you know in the retail world and and from the independent traders who can hit that
00:45:46.720 eight figure return level that multi8 figure return level it's very difficult um
00:45:54.560 I think the statistic is is right and you know there's only
00:46:00.560 I believe he's even worse like 92 if there's 100 people 92 people will not
00:46:06.640 make it and the rest of eight people four people will cut it even then going to the rest of four person four people
00:46:13.839 uh then uh two people will will be barely up and there's going to be two
00:46:20.640 person left one person is up 100k and the first person is up 10
00:46:26.880 million so it's I have I know I have a
00:46:31.920 lot of brokerage owner friends and they telling me the statistics is actually like that so
00:46:38.480 do you think there's something special about that one person that it's not something that someone could learn to become but something really just within
00:46:45.200 them that makes them different a lot of people go into this industry because they see how much money they can make
00:46:50.400 now I actually love trading um I just love being there and love to
00:46:57.599 being competitive but you cannot be so competitive that uh you feel for about
00:47:04.720 it so uh be willing to take the loss first of all people are not coming into
00:47:12.000 this game for the right reason and second they cannot last as long um
00:47:18.319 people tends to get too emotional fight one ticker for one or two days blow up their account then never come back again
00:47:25.280 and the key component for this is you have to be in this game long enough to
00:47:30.480 see how yourself really behave uh throughout the years and find a way to actually
00:47:39.599 like a method to let's say withdraw your money after a profitable win think about
00:47:45.359 that withdraw money is actually a loss find method to counter yourself because
00:47:51.040 it's it's um very I'll say anti-human nature game so
00:47:58.720 um and a lot of people are not in this for they give up in the middle maybe in the course of one or two years uh they
00:48:05.760 don't really focus on the strategy they're developing they don't have the passion about all they have passion
00:48:12.240 about is how much money they can make and uh they don't have they don't put enough work into it it's a very boring
00:48:20.800 uh because for for myself I'm sitting here and
00:48:26.960 maybe tomorrow there's no trade maybe day after tomorrow there's no trade you're expecting
00:48:33.839 pretty much you are not expecting you are going to make money tomorrow so it's a lot of people can't really uh handle
00:48:40.240 that maybe three months half six months so let's take a break for a minute there guys cuz I want to tell you about our

00:50:45.680 below now let's get back to the episode do you feel like there's a lot of people
00:50:50.720 who call themselves traders but more so they're just addicted to the markets and therefore they probably should quit but
00:50:58.000 they keep trying because they're essentially addicted to the P&L they're essentially gambling so they're actually
00:51:03.599 just gambling addicts but within the markets versus say in a casino m um
00:51:10.160 and a large a large part of that problem is that why they their resistance to change to actually as you say do the
00:51:17.200 work actually treat it for what it's meant to be and essentially really
00:51:22.800 compete and and think of it in that way because when I've spoken to thankfully you know through this tour I've got to
00:51:29.520 speak to some verified seven figure and eight figure traders and it's the same
00:51:34.720 mindset it's that mindset of the competitiveness It's not trying to compete with you know other traders it's
00:51:41.359 just their their performance and how they can be the best performance possible within the markets mhm and I
00:51:48.079 see that clear difference as you mentioned like the money yeah you could the money's great and that's a byproduct
00:51:53.440 though of that performance and of that focus on your process versus the people
00:51:58.640 who only focus on the money they ignore process and as a byproduct they end up losing money are the ones who are
00:52:04.400 focused on the process and that competitiveness as a byproduct they end up making Yeah yeah so do you feel like
00:52:10.880 there's a lot of traders out there who have that mindset they just have a gambling mindset and end up just they
00:52:16.960 they think they're passionate about the markets when in reality they've just essentially become addicts to the markets
00:52:23.440 uh that I agree a lot because it's uh I
00:52:29.200 I I taught many students and they seeing how they more 90% of them becomes gamblers they
00:52:37.359 make one huge trade and they think they can make it again it's um actually making a huge gain one trade
00:52:44.720 is not very uh not very good for beginner traders because they don't know how to handle that emotion
00:52:52.319 uh then it turns into a gambling habits and they just got addicted to it yeah
00:52:57.440 what do you say to to those traders then when you see that happening uh if you're really aiming for a long
00:53:04.640 game um you have to know inside out of your own strategy let's say you are
00:53:13.440 trading uh a smaller cap and uh now I have a person that also expert
00:53:20.880 in small cap i ask you what's the best minimum threshold resistance for you to
00:53:27.440 short at you will be able to give me an answer what's the minimum pullback percentages in terms of decimal points
00:53:33.040 for a red day you will be able to give me an answer not you sitting there okay
00:53:39.200 well I think it's going to go red oh maybe I'm going to cover here maybe I'm going to do that it's not accurate um
00:53:46.079 and uh if you're in here for full time then make sure you know you look like a
00:53:51.599 full time full time you know yeah so really putting in that effort as as we talked about earlier rather than just
00:53:57.359 doing carbon copy and paste and just thinking okay I'll watch this video or I'll learn
00:54:03.839 this information here but actually apply not just applying it but actually learning the statistics behind it
00:54:09.440 finding the data behind that information regardless of what that information is spending the time to do so because you
00:54:17.119 essentially that's adopting that performance mindset it's um something one particular trader did to learn was
00:54:24.640 they would record their screen uh during the trade you know and then they would review that and sometimes
00:54:31.040 slow it down just like you would in terms of uh being a professional athlete you they would watch tapes of the other
00:54:37.520 teams learn the strengths and weaknesses both from what themselves did in the game but also their opponents and it's
00:54:43.839 the same principle and I think a lot of traders are missing that and that's something that's really opened my eyes
00:54:49.040 in terms of the emphasis and focus on performance and how can we optimize performance is that something you're
00:54:54.640 still doing to this day yes still doing to this day yes what sort of things is there anything recently that you've you
00:55:01.040 sort of identified that you can optimize and then what did you do to optimize it uh
00:55:06.720 yes there there's a lot of ticker um for example QBT I did that trade I made 1.2
00:55:15.040 2 million uh in terms of sizing in terms of executions I could done a lot better um
00:55:23.119 especially on the entry size that trade that could potentially made up to uh 4
00:55:29.520 to 5 million and there's another ticker RGTI um
00:55:35.200 I could have made at least three million instead of one so
00:55:41.680 and also have some problems with the execution as well so
00:55:48.240 uh going to the next motive honor I'm going to be more decis decisive on the
00:55:55.760 when moment momentum tends to shift and be more passive about tickers that's
00:56:02.640 uh especially for multi-day runners there's red day stuck in in the middle so I need to slowly sizing in not
00:56:11.119 being very concentrated in one day so interesting so when you identify these
00:56:16.880 things you then do you look to then create processes for thereafter so when you identify them the next time you
00:56:23.440 already have like a set structure to follow it's so interesting how I'm sure people
00:56:30.400 in the audience at home hear you say I made a million i could have made three for them it probably Oh no no no it's
00:56:37.599 not about the it's still about the money of course but what I mean is that is the level of thinking though it's the level
00:56:43.440 it's not about the money side it's about how do I perform better right how do you there was a missed opportunity there
00:56:48.640 it's more about how do you control risk to the maximum and amplify the
00:56:55.359 reward to the maximum um that's why I said $3 million because if if I can
00:57:00.799 handle more risk of course I can make more but uh always think about in your own shoes of how do you control your
00:57:07.200 risk and into a way that you can amplify the reward into you know significant
00:57:14.240 amount in terms of risk wise though what does that look like for you are you sort
00:57:20.400 of using a dynamic risk in terms of when do you grade your setups as well is
00:57:25.440 there particular scenarios where you're risking a lot more versus other scenarios where you're risking less we already talked about when you uh you
00:57:32.000 know taking losses you you half it down um what what happens on the flip side if
00:57:39.200 I start to win um so it's very interesting because I if
00:57:45.599 if I tends to show something like
00:57:51.200 uh multidoner that that's into the billion dollar market cap majority of
00:57:56.400 the time stock tends to bounce once they bounce there that means there is another opportunity to short again and also
00:58:03.599 there's potential buying opportunities once the stock dips very much um so once
00:58:09.200 I start making the first initial entry uh I made let's say
00:58:15.200 300k and then my original risk was 300k to 350k and I can amplify my risk to 600
00:58:24.799 if I'm very confident um then I will be able to generate maybe risk ratio one to one that's how I'll be able to make $1
00:58:31.200 million in uh in one trade because my original risk is 300k by the end of the
00:58:37.119 day I made 1.5 maybe even 2.5 because I was using the gains plus my original
00:58:43.440 risk uh to amplify the reward so interesting now if I'm down at the very
00:58:50.079 beginning then I'll be very u conservative sometimes I'm too conservative that I didn't make the gain
00:58:56.480 I'm supposed to make but I'm okay with that so because when you are making the
00:59:01.760 profitable trades as you said you're paying yourself do you do that almost immediately or is it something you do at the end of the week month and you're
00:59:08.079 using that the profits to your advantage on on future trades during that period uh do it immediately immediately
00:59:15.520 so then you you will just compound and use the the portion that you leave in there correct yes interesting
00:59:21.200 and also make sure for beginning traders that um doing that make sure to set up
00:59:27.760 two bank accounts for your backup account let's say you made a huge mistake at the very beginning everybody
00:59:32.799 blew up i think in the beginner beginning stage losing 50% 30% I think it's very normal because you know people
00:59:39.680 make mistakes you have two backup accounts to you know put funds back in so you start over again so not to just
00:59:47.440 constantly go out you take the money out and then start spending it and and so therefore if anything does happen then
00:59:54.000 you know insurance yeah to make sure they stay in the game for a long time to gain the experience definitely and in
01:00:02.480 terms of trading one issue that traders do face is that there's no guarantee of
01:00:08.960 how much you'll make in trading you know one month it could be six figures next month it could be seven one month it
01:00:14.640 could be flat like how important or how helpful has it been is it something that you've done where you've created income
01:00:20.720 sources outside of trading whether it's investments whether it's businesses is
01:00:25.760 that something that's been helpful is it something that you've done uh I have a few rental properties they don't really
01:00:32.720 generate great income compared to uh I mean if you you have to like take loans
01:00:39.359 to you know amplify the reward i don't really like that so I just buy them in cash and they don't really generate that
01:00:46.480 much income and maybe maximum 10% cap rate and if you buy a million dollar in
01:00:52.160 terms of property and 10% 100k and divide by by 12 per month that's a few thousand dollars a month um
01:00:59.680 and uh um right now I would say the best is for
01:01:05.839 traders in terms of passive investment probably T bills because interest
01:01:11.520 interest rates pretty high you can put money in the T bills and you can still be able to use the money that you trade
01:01:18.240 if you need the money you just sell T bills and it's it's very liquid and
01:01:24.640 very pinish back in and yeah you should be good to go so I like that and in
01:01:30.240 terms of uh mentorship when you started uh trading was there any particular mentors
01:01:37.599 that you had anyone that you still in contact with this day or is it more so sort of a self-taught journey it's more
01:01:44.000 of a self-taught journey um I'm I'm very good friends with Tinger Towni we play
01:01:51.200 lot of video games together um and uh we don't really talk to talk about trading
01:01:56.960 that much it's you know sometimes he text me I ask you know what do you think about this ticker i say okay well
01:02:03.440 probably going to drop today or tomorrow but you know it's nothing very
01:02:10.480 uh detailed in strategy and statistics yeah cuz
01:02:16.799 one thing that was interesting to me is I remember you mentioning a figure saying like you know the sort of limit a
01:02:18.000 No text
01:02:22.960 retail trader could probably get to is about 200 million yes I have because right now I'm very
01:02:30.400 focused on that because uh I'm reaching uh
01:02:35.599 uh I'll say very soon I'm going to reach that limit so I'm tracking the maximum
01:02:41.359 shares maximum profit I can make uh according to my strategy before my
01:02:47.839 return ts to diminish a lot um and from my performance in a I mean for
01:02:56.240 retail traders you don't really have to worry about that because your return really start to diminish once you hit
01:03:01.760 the 100 million in equity mark but once you hit 100 million people can just retire mhm um but personally for me I
01:03:09.920 would like to challenge to the maximum so uh of course there is certain tickers
01:03:15.839 and not for GMEC that you can size into the billions but those are exceptions but for regular tickers
01:03:21.839 uh how much volume on that day you have and how much shares you can size in in that day um it's very
01:03:29.599 challenging i'm still testing it um and I'm running into much bigger people like
01:03:36.079 uh bigger fonts that tends to then we play games against each other
01:03:42.160 trying to trying to counter each other so that the different this like the next level beyond where the re retail
01:03:48.720 independent traders are yes i mean maybe they're retail but typically retail don't really have
01:03:54.559 700k 800k in the bid or ask so uh but I think a majority is probably the fund um
01:04:03.119 and in in terms of uh you at the moment are you purely just independent managing your own capital or you managing capital
01:04:09.280 for others at all no just for myself just for yourself do you think that's something you're going to do in the future um probably yeah is that where
01:04:17.200 where the goal sort of leads you in terms of the performance-wise a new level to to break and and to achieve
01:04:23.920 would be going into that sort of more you capital under management hedge fund
01:04:28.960 sort of route probably in the future um because you
01:04:35.839 know eventually you want to retire you don't want to trade I mean you still want to trade but not being very active
01:04:42.640 uh being all stressful about it managing taking multi-million dollar positions
01:04:47.839 but um going to the future maybe start a fund uh do the track record for a few
01:04:54.400 years and hire some traders give them medications and maybe that could be a
01:04:59.520 passive income source we'll see interesting very interesting and do you feel like
01:05:06.880 do you feel like uh in terms of time horizon with your outlook on the markets
01:05:12.559 you know especially coming into this year we have obviously President Trump coming back in the traders you know all
01:05:17.839 love Trump you know last time he was in power the the markets were very volatile uh is that something that you take into
01:05:24.720 consideration I know obviously we talked about you don't really look at fundamentals but is that something you take into consideration him coming into
01:05:30.640 power and obviously we've seen just in the last maybe six months maybe even three months so many in plays from AI to
01:05:37.920 quantum to so many different things that are just constantly getting volatility and movements mhm obly S&P last year had
01:05:45.680 I can't remember the exact number maybe 17 alltime highs last year yeah and then coming into this year we've actually had
01:05:51.359 quite a interesting dip obviously it's very early on what is your projection what are you looking for what do you
01:05:56.559 think's going to take place i'm uh to be honest I think
01:06:03.039 um not really sure in terms of macroeconomy um I think in 2025 it's
01:06:12.319 with the tariff and everything and the inflation I think market will actually dip quite a bit then once everything is
01:06:20.079 sorted out we'll come back again but in terms of volatilities it's very good for
01:06:25.119 traders especially for long and short so but I think we will have probably a
01:06:31.760 little bit more dip before we go up my personal opinion but uh um that's where
01:06:39.440 I think the overall I think there's a lot of like hope and optimism with Trump getting elected we had such huge pushes
01:06:46.319 of cryptocurrency across all markets pretty much and then you feel like the the general sentiment will be trying to
01:06:53.680 look for you know how he performs early on into his sort of presidency see what
01:06:59.520 he puts in place especially not only internally within the US but around the world so much happening there as well um
01:07:06.559 and you think it'll be based off that performance maybe he comes in does what he said manages to put it in place so
01:07:11.760 the market starts to you know price that back in or he ends up being a bit slow and and not being able to sort of
01:07:17.680 implement the stuff and therefore the market could stagnate and maybe even dip further i think you'll probably dip
01:07:25.440 before we go up um especially with the current trend on
01:07:30.559 inflations and the tariff potential yeah in terms of your trades most of them are
01:07:37.520 they normally within the same day within a few days or are you holding out quite quite often as well no more than two
01:07:44.079 days just Yeah typically it's either Yeah typically is in one day within one
01:07:50.160 day do you feel like as you as you continue to have your career start to
01:07:56.480 you handle more and more capital as it continues to grow hopefully do you feel like that time horizon will expand or
01:08:02.640 stay the same uh well say stay the same uh I still
01:08:08.559 haven't hit the mark where I my return is going to start to diminish yeah and
01:08:15.680 how many trades are you looking at you know per or not looking at but taking per sort of week or month per month uh
01:08:23.279 sometimes 10 average like seven eight not trading
01:08:29.120 every day but yeah and some some there's some months there's only two or three
01:08:34.640 just all what is it really based on what's like the main driver to that is it volatility is it is there a
01:08:40.000 No text
01:08:41.439 particular thing that really dictates the number of trades that you're taking uh it's it's about the pattern does it
01:08:47.359 really fit the pattern does it really fit the volume I'm looking for uh majority of the time throughout the year
01:08:54.799 since October to February it's generally very good season
01:09:01.040 to trade starting in March to September that's
01:09:07.040 where the boring time is so majority of the money that was made is between
01:09:12.799 October to I would say maximum March yeah would you say that that is the case
01:09:18.158 that as you say the majority of money will be made in a shorter period of time would you also say that the majority of
01:09:25.439 money would also be made on a fewer amount of tickers like the same tickers
01:09:30.960 the same stocks or does that that not really factor in uh I mean specifically
01:09:36.960 DJT yes I ticker I made stupid amount of money but I think it
01:09:43.120 was 17 $18 million in just of one ticker yeah but but other than that exception
01:09:49.279 but everything is spread out yeah and do you have like a goal figure in mind i
01:09:55.840 know we talked about 200 million being sort of where maybe returns can start to diminish do you have a figure in mind for yourself where once you reach you'll
01:10:02.800 be you'll be happy you'll be maybe maybe done with trade feel like you completed the game uh no no not really i just love
01:10:08.800 the game i love to trade and um uh in terms of figures not really i just
01:10:14.800 want to see I'm actually affecting the ticker to give me diminishing return
01:10:21.840 that makes me uh quite happy because I achieved that goal yeah that's right so
01:10:27.840 for example let's say because I mean in the real world if we talk
01:10:34.560 about trading is you when you made money you're basic essentially taking money from other people so let's say 10 people
01:10:42.000 bought a ticker uh and the maximum paying is
01:10:47.040 probably 30% so let's say the maximum you can make it's $30,000
01:10:53.840 and the more share I size in the less percentage the taker needs to drop uh
01:11:00.640 now if I size in too much the ticker only needs to drop maybe 1% or less than
01:11:05.920 1% then buyers are not even u nervous about that so that's where your return t
01:11:11.760 turns to diminish uh but I want to see that when I'm trading maybe in a billion
01:11:17.280 dollar market cap and I see the returns actually being diminishing by me then I
01:11:22.560 probably think okay well that's uh that's where I want to be at least that's where the goal for me and you
01:11:28.159 know that is that that 200 million mark you think i don't think so i that's
01:11:33.199 that's where I think where it is but once I I'm not there yet but once I reach there I will let you know
01:11:38.880 definitely definitely have you ever shared how much you've actually you know made in total from the markers no no no
01:11:45.840 do you have you given like a ballpark figure uh
01:11:51.120 no no no i mean I just want to prove that I
01:11:56.880 uh I mean I verify bunch of one of my accounts in Kinfo yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:12:02.400 yeah so I just want to make sure that people under my Twitter and they say "Oh
01:12:07.679 it's a fake traders." I mean I'm not I mean I don't really care about that just uh there's something for you to see of
01:12:14.640 course so and I know
01:12:20.000 one way or one interest of yours is gaming that's one thing you do when you're not on the charts do you feel
01:12:26.159 like that's been something that's actually helped you in your trading career in terms of the mindset not all of the games but
01:12:32.800 Starcraft 2 actually helped a lot in terms of APM action action per minute uh
01:12:40.320 you type a lot faster back in the days you borrow shares a lot faster because
01:12:45.520 shares are very hard to get back in the days and then three four years ago i'm always faster than other people so I get
01:12:52.080 all the shares and people don't get any shares and uh I will be able to make the trade and make the profit um
01:12:59.280 um and also Starcraft is very it's always about counter strategies so when
01:13:05.600 I get into something I was thinking about what other people are thinking to be able to generate a strategy to counter uh that type of mindset has
01:13:13.360 helped a lot and engineer mindset about the statistics yeah you mentioned Yeah yeah speed is an interesting one because
01:13:19.920 it wasn't any something I ever thought about when it came to trading like actually having an edge when depending
01:13:25.440 on your speed of how fast you can act why is that important in terms of being a trader uh speed because sh
01:13:33.600 not right now but shares back in the days are very limited let's say there's three million flow 5 million flow there's only like maybe 300k shares to
01:13:40.400 borrow uh soon as the market uh and far as the shares being available maybe
01:13:46.080 sometimes in seven eight you keep clicking freshing clicking freshing and you have to tap the numbers you want i'm
01:13:52.719 always faster than them um I mean it doesn't seem like a big deal but sometimes it is a big deal what about in
01:13:59.360 terms of execution wise is there is there times when you if you're not fast enough you the market will move you know
01:14:04.960 without you and then if you were to enter there it kind of go against the plan go mess with the statistics I don't
01:14:10.320 think that's about the speed I think everybody has the speed of once the market opens and getting the executions
01:14:17.280 but the shares will be available probably within 5 seconds or maybe even two seconds so if you do it 0.5 second
01:14:25.280 faster you you take all the shares and other people don't then 50k drops $7
01:14:31.280 then you make three you know 350k in terms of your day as you said about timing as well like what times do you
01:14:38.000 No text
01:14:38.560 trade is there particular times that you trade and and certain certain times that you won't trade at all uh
01:14:45.679 particular time or if there is a very important ticker that's been running for a while then I will get
01:14:52.320 right here time zone probably 4:00 a.m yeah sometimes even 1:00 a.m i made the
01:14:57.760 DJT trade at 1:00 a.m really yeah it was crazy um
01:15:03.440 majority of the time I wake up about uh Eastern time is 9:20 9:15 i give myself
01:15:11.360 maybe right now I give myself 10 to 15 minutes to look at the market and and
01:15:16.800 make the trade back in the days I have to force myself not to trade in the pre-market so I wake up at 9:29 to wake
01:15:24.000 up as late as possible late as possible and uh then go from there so what was it
01:15:30.000 about that that particular trade though 1:00 a.m that made you execute then uh DJT mhm uh it was that's when he the day
01:15:38.320 he got elected um they gapped up to 50 hitting the resistance mhm i took uh I
01:15:46.880 believe I took uh forgot like close to 100k shares at 50
01:15:52.320 and dropped to 40 41 i I cover around 40 to 42 range bounced back to 46 that's
01:15:59.760 where I pushed in a lot of size soon as the market opened dropped to I
01:16:05.520 believe it was 30 36 yeah 36 34.5ish
01:16:12.880 so essentially the opportunity was then at that time so you had to just if you wanted to take advantage of it you had
01:16:18.719 to be there yeah had to be there yes it's interesting because a lot of
01:16:25.040 traders they won't go above and essentially I would class that as going above and beyond you know making sure to
01:16:31.120 even if it's inconvenient you know essentially inconvenient to sort of make
01:16:36.320 that happen it's obviously worth it or the byproduct of it is worth it in terms of the result but I know a lot of
01:16:42.800 traders especially in the the sort of retail space I would class them as
01:16:49.040 I was saying like noviceses but in terms of if If you're going to you know compare and obviously we don't compare traders like that but what I mean is for
01:16:56.159 where they're at their skill level their goal is to be more like yourself
01:17:01.360 or more like the verified 8 figure traders and having that performance but they won't replicate that work ethic
01:17:08.400 they won't replicate the things that you guys are willing to do to make those returns m it's kind of similar to how
01:17:15.120 you mentioned uh near the beginning of the podcast we talked about you look at people's uh losses you know you look at
01:17:21.440 their processes you look at their their mindsets it seems like a lot of traders now
01:17:27.199 especially I'm sure you might have seen it in terms of uh when you first started to now in terms of all the content
01:17:32.800 that's out there all the all the different uh you know videos and and people who are in the markets
01:17:39.760 it seems now like traders will just like to watch they just want to watch these videos they uh they just want to watch a
01:17:45.120 chart breakdown they just want to see um these sort of things lifestyle videos
01:17:50.480 even versus going beyond that to to learn the
01:17:55.520 processes you know so even like with this podcast we've talked a lot about processes we've talked a lot about the things that you've done and still do and
01:18:02.159 even now doing but a lot of people won't then look to learn from that yeah they'll just hear
01:18:07.280 it and maybe make notes but they won't then go try and figure out how can they do something similar to to try and excel
01:18:13.120 and and grow as a trader as well if you really want to be a trader you can be a good trader if you don't if you don't
01:18:20.560 have the dedication you won't be it's very simple if you really in your heart you want to be you like this game and
01:18:26.080 you love this game you want to be a very good trader on top 1% top 0.1% you can be that
01:18:33.440 so has there ever been a trader who inspires you at very beginning uh Gratani yeah he was
01:18:42.159 the one that um I believe made millions when when I was 19 years old really yeah
01:18:51.600 um he's the one that I feel re I feel real about you know when I talk to him
01:18:58.800 i can hear and when I well back in this day I don't have a chance to talk to him but when I look hear about his videos I
01:19:04.480 can hear in his voice that he loved this game he is as real and psycho and every
01:19:11.600 single strategy if is uh focused on thought processes and the psychology uh
01:19:18.719 behind the pattern I think it make made sense for me I think uh that's yeah
01:19:24.560 that's the first person that I really admire to to be a trader So amazing
01:19:29.600 that's amazing to hear i'm sure how does it feel to know that you're in that position now where people look to you in
01:19:36.159 that same way uh doesn't feel that much um
01:19:42.960 I don't know it just feels normal feels normal um no I feel like it's
01:19:50.320 people look at me as the the best trader out there i mean I look at myself as
01:19:57.199 probably the worst trader compared compared to whatever I designed uh I
01:20:02.560 make tons of mistakes everybody make mistakes um it's more about patience and
01:20:08.320 more about uh being survive being able to survive for this long so it's
01:20:15.520 interesting you mentioned that actually about mistakes because I think a lot of traders have a
01:20:21.360 misconception about profitability they assume that once you are consistent once you have your profitability you're a
01:20:28.560 perfect trader you know you make maybe small losses maybe small mistakes but never you know large losses or or big
01:20:35.679 mistakes no no everybody make losses i still make stupid mistakes up to up to
01:20:41.840 up to date so it's uh I'm sure they'll be glad they'll be glad to hear it i
01:20:47.040 don't know where I'm not sure where that comes from maybe that's where you know some of the the bad actors if you will
01:20:52.800 the ones who aren't actually trading present a false image and a lot of people just assume that then that's how
01:20:58.480 it should be you know just win win so it's always good to hear you know for you to share something like that where
01:21:04.640 it's you know I still make mistakes etc and hopefully people will be able to take that on board we already talked
01:21:10.080 about obviously what happens you know when you do make those mistakes the process you take and hopefully they'll be able to learn from that and sort of
01:21:16.159 take that on board as well uh in terms of like recent trades like what was a you know a recent trade that you took
01:21:22.320 and and the sort of process and reasoning behind that the mistakes no no
01:21:27.840 a trade like a recent trade that you've taken whether it's a win or a loss um but like something that was recent maybe
01:21:33.600 your last trade what was last trade was holo ho yeah made uh 2.5 million wow um
01:21:40.880 the thought process behind that is um I believe
01:21:49.440 QBT because it's all content play and I believe RTI and QBT are both losing
01:21:55.679 momentum uh then holo traded a massive mon shares I
01:22:01.920 think it was before reaching eight on the previous day so there is not enough
01:22:07.280 momentum to support that consolidation spike so I tested my
01:22:12.320 shares uh size in I think was beginning shares was 50K then slowly gradually adding
01:22:19.920 control my risk I think was the risking was 350K
01:22:25.920 uh then once it panics I added more once I added more shares I think up to 500k
01:22:32.800 then once then my risk come down to 75% of that entire panic then just went all
01:22:39.600 the way to four I was not expecting that so I covered my majority of the shares then I resized in into the bounces um I
01:22:48.719 think I made one point 1 1.8 then I made another 700 on adding on the
01:22:54.639 bounces going back down so
01:23:00.239 that's a that's was at the start of the year so this No that's December 31st
01:23:05.760 last day of the year has there not been any trades this in this year so far uh this year let's see what um
01:23:16.000 RGTI yes RGTI uh most recent was 1.2
01:23:22.400 million but I actually took 500k losses on the two on on
01:23:28.000 250K on RGTI before I made the 1.2 uh then 250K
01:23:34.800 on other tickers i But those were valid losses it was valid losses yes now maybe
01:23:40.320 RTI that one was little bit stupid but stupid about size too too much okay you
01:23:48.000 know when you're trading the volume and size that you are is that why you're having to sort of spread the the entries
01:23:56.080 not exactly no there's some tickers you have to concentrate your entries like QBT at the open when they dropped that's
01:24:02.320 where you have to concentrate probably 500k shares in one go in one go yeah why
01:24:08.400 is that the speed and of the movement or Yeah because you will panic very fast so
01:24:14.000 if you don't get that entry then you won't be able to get it um there there
01:24:19.520 are tickers that when when it's going up and slowly panic and once you reach the panic mode then you will start going
01:24:24.800 fast but uh for tickers that opens that you're expecting massive panic I would
01:24:31.920 highly suggest that you concentrate maybe 50% your positions in one go then need to go another 50% one thing I did
01:24:38.960 want to ask you is obviously we having these these huge whose year what was your record year it was last year a
01:24:44.800 record year for you or in terms of P&L no no record year was 2021
01:24:50.960 so this is what my question is is like when you have a record year
01:24:56.239 and then subsequent years aren't breaking that what happens psych psychologically is
01:25:01.840 that something that makes you think in a certain kind of way like I'm not I'm not progressing i need
01:25:08.480 to beat that or is that not your measure of success no no i don't really track it
01:25:13.600 by money wise i track it by the the calculator that I built
01:25:19.280 it's uh Yeah i I track down specific tickers uh calculating their current day
01:25:25.760 volume how much the maximum I can make per month i add them together if I'm reaching and if I'm close to that number
01:25:32.320 I'm happy even though it's 1 million even though it's 100k I'm happy with that but if it's big difference then you
01:25:38.400 know there's something so that's what you measure yeah yeah how important do you think that is because do you feel like it is quite easy as a trader in
01:25:45.600 particular to really associate your success to your P&L so only so for
01:25:52.880 example record year 2021 you know 2022 wasn't beating it 2023 wasn't beating it could you imagine that if let's say a
01:25:59.280 trader was in a similar position and they hadn't got the process that you put in place and how you measure success
01:26:04.880 that they could easily find themselves you know psychologically damaged or you
01:26:10.800 chasing something that they shouldn't really be chasing not really though because um I don't really measure
01:26:18.320 success like that i measure success by um am I making the perfect trades
01:26:23.440 throughout the year if I did and the money always comes in you uh I was a pretty good amount even though you're
01:26:30.080 only making uh let's say I made 500k then I have to beat that 500k
01:26:37.360 it doesn't once you hit a certain threshold it doesn't really change your lifestyle that much it's more about just
01:26:43.040 uh um you only eat three meals a day
01:26:48.480 start eating me 10 meals a day yeah so this is what I was getting at though do
01:26:54.159 you think that's a mistake that traders probably fall into quite naturally in terms of chasing the high you know
01:27:00.159 measuring success by higher P&L obviously you don't do that i I don't do that i mean maybe other people do that
01:27:05.520 but when I talk to my friends they don't do that they don't do that either either obviously your friends though would
01:27:10.880 probably be in very similar position to you in terms of their trading and results wise yeah they might be like "Oh
01:27:16.000 No text
01:27:18.400 it kind of sucks because I didn't make $4 million or I made three." Yeah I don't think it's it's interesting i'm
01:27:25.600 hoping that's a brings a lot of awareness to the like I said the the sort of audience because I can imagine
01:27:31.199 that that's how they would measure success as like a sort of a a scaling consistent you year-on-year growth and
01:27:38.400 I'm sure it probably looked that like looked like that sorry very early on as you mentioned you know the the first
01:27:43.440 year was it 27k to 900k so that was a huge leap and I'm sure the year after
01:27:48.560 that more than likely probably more than that uh 900 to four for a medium yeah
01:27:54.239 and then the year after that probably again another incremental jump yeah and then maybe then or maybe a bit a few
01:28:00.400 more of those leaps and then it starts to um not stagnate but essentially
01:28:06.000 average out versus these huge leaps each year no it was it was crazy i can't really
01:28:12.320 say on the Yeah no that's fine no what I was getting at though is more so that
01:28:17.440 those leaps will happen but it won't just always happen forever it will then get to a point where the returns
01:28:23.520 like these last three three four years if you take out the exception exceptional years then it's like that
01:28:30.320 what do you What was the difference for 2021 was it just the market conditions at the time it was the most insane year
01:28:36.800 I have ever seen uh the volume wise the the opportunity wise
01:28:44.080 and uh I'm not the best in 2020 i think I did pretty good but I heard there's one guy
01:28:51.600 started the year with 250K turning to 960 million
01:28:59.760 there's actually it's a real story yes i'm not the best we need to get him on
01:29:05.600 the podcast i I don't I don't know who he is but but yes I heard uh there's a guy yes wow wow
01:29:14.960 wow there's there's always Yeah there's always a level up so yeah does that
01:29:20.320 always keep you humble as well when you hear stories like that oh yeah it keeps me humble it sounds crazy i I want to I
01:29:27.840 think it's actually doable if I am in the perfect state if I perform the
01:29:32.880 perfect way that I think I will perform I think it's doable but in terms of doing it real time it's still it's very
01:29:43.040 very very very impressive yeah to be able to achieve the sort of results that you have do you believe
01:29:49.360 that being dynamic with your risk is a huge component of that
01:29:56.560 yes you need to know when you need to amplify your risk yes when you are right
01:30:02.800 and you lock the profits I think it if there's a good pattern yeah you can
01:30:08.800 amplify and add that profit into your risk the maximum you lose you just have a shitty day that reached your maximum
01:30:15.920 risk but amplifying that it's I think it's quite
01:30:21.120 good way to what are the factors that allow you to do that is it maybe a particularly statistically better uh
01:30:28.560 trade like a statistics are more on your side for that particular trade correct yes is another element when you've
01:30:34.639 already made probably like your profit buffer from past trades has started to increase as well or is is that not just
01:30:40.159 on intraday just that you only focus on that that particular
01:30:45.440 day this is the best size fair enough and before we do wrap up I did collect
01:30:51.679 questions for this tour from the audience okay so I would like to if it's okay with you
01:30:58.320 we'll just uh we'll take a look this could be interesting so this is from I
01:31:06.080 can't even pronounce his name kronos maybe so apologies if I say that wrong
01:31:11.120 but how do you manage the mental toll of high stakes trading especially during a
01:31:16.400 loss or market crash it's it's difficult um I tend to listen
01:31:25.120 a lot of calm music plays a lot of uh video games so just keep your mind off
01:31:30.960 keep my mind off it yeah um and uh you can't really change the past so what you
01:31:38.000 can do is to improve in the future that's has that always been your mindset or is that something you learned through
01:31:43.760 the trading experience or through some other experience then through the trading experience you I mean you can't
01:31:48.880 really just completely ignore the losses because you know it's actually a loss you have to learn from it you can't be
01:31:54.880 too harsh to yourself because it just damages your decision to go into the
01:32:00.639 next trade kind of have to balance it out so uh that's very important and as
01:32:05.679 part of that is having things outside of trading ah important yeah meditate and do some sports play some tennis and then
01:32:12.560 play some video games yeah yeah that's good people can be asking for your gamer tag or or whatever you Oh that's fine
01:32:20.320 that's fine um okay this is an interesting one how how
01:32:28.480 you dealt with so how did you deal with self-sabotage in the beginning of your journey so like overtrading making the
01:32:35.120 same mistakes over and over I know we discussed overtrading earlier on but what about making mistakes were there
01:32:40.639 any mistakes early on in your career that you made over and over again oh yes there is always overtrading uh do that
01:32:46.719 every single month every single week so a lot of people I I spoke to have
01:32:52.639 experience uh talking to students that every week or every month go to your
01:32:58.880 account statements look at your losses what going back into losses what did you do is it overtrade then next time make
01:33:07.199 sure to avoid that um and a lot of people are not willing to go back to their accounts look at their losses
01:33:12.880 because they think it's it's a shame to look at so what was there any steps you
01:33:19.280 had to take to reduce the overtrading uh I have done many waking up at 9:29 to
01:33:26.639 avoid yeah and back in the days I have to like
01:33:33.360 I bought like a 100 miles so pass is 12 I think it was passes 11:30
01:33:40.960 p.m and just cut the mouse don't trade you can't trade you replace with another one in the morning that's extreme that's
01:33:49.920 Wow you got to do what you got to do you got I like that that's great um we need to have a link we need to get
01:33:57.280 like an affiliate link to a to a mouse company who can make sure it's cheap
01:34:04.080 okay let's do one more let's do one more do you always Okay okay this is an interesting one
01:34:10.000 No text
01:34:10.719 actually very good um Young Bando it's an interesting name but do you always
01:34:16.480 enter when you see your entry criteria but if not what helps you deter you if
01:34:21.679 you should enter a trade or not and the reason I think that's interesting is more so that have you ever had moments where it fit your entry criteria but
01:34:29.360 something was telling you that this you know maybe something some sort of catalyst is in play at the time that may
01:34:35.040 make you feel like okay this isn't the right trade to try and take is that has that ever happened at all yes it happens
01:34:40.320 um small size that's the correct answer
01:34:46.159 one10enth of the of the size yeah what have you got like an example of where
01:34:51.840 that might have happened maybe not a specific like trade but just what how what went through your mind or you know
01:34:56.880 what was the reason for even though it fit your criteria you weren't feeling like that was the right trade to put the
01:35:02.239 full size on okay so let's say I'm shorting something that has bigger resistance and the intraday volume is
01:35:09.280 out of control and um the stock is not pulling back uh at all it pulled back
01:35:16.639 instant got bought out uh and um the volume is very concentrated in one place
01:35:24.000 that might be break that might be a sign to break through the resistance so I rather size down and wait after it loses
01:35:32.320 the consolidation then I will probably push more size but during the consolidations usually with less volume
01:35:39.199 I just go 50% the position but at that situation specifically maybe one10enth
01:35:44.719 yeah how much does intuition play in into trading into your trading in particular 20 30% yeah how would you
01:35:51.280 describe intuition for yourself in terms of
01:35:57.520 exiting points mhm so if the volume it
01:36:03.760 stock is panicking and it's trading tons of volume uh usually the reverse sign is
01:36:10.159 the candlesticks becomes trading into the four five million zone you know a billion dollar market cap that's where
01:36:17.040 you start to basically exiting on your intuition you don't really know if it's
01:36:22.480 going to keep dropping or not uh but uh you follow the average statistics um you
01:36:28.719 let's say that negative is usually it's negative 26% sometimes it drops to 40 50% so you exiting half and where you
01:36:38.159 think it's going to if you think it's going to drop more you exiting half but that's based on intuition uh but if you
01:36:45.199 think it's going to bounce you just cover 80% 90% of your position so yeah I
01:36:50.960 like that let me call that one a day one question I wanted to ask you it's a bit of a random one i used to ask this
